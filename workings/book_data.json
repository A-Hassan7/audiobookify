            "summary_and_notes": "",
            "content": "Saturday 7th August, 1971\nHe woke up in the dark. It was too hot in the little room they\u2019d put him in, being early August. Though he supposed that could be the fever. He always had a high temperature, the morning after. They used to put him in a room with a window, but a few months ago he\u2019d been able to smash one of them, and if it hadn\u2019t had bars anyway then he\u2019d have escaped. He\u2019d heard them talking about restraining him as he got older. He tried not to think about it.\nHe remembered the feeling of hunger, so intense it transformed into rage. He remembered howling and keening for hours, circling the cell over and over again. Perhaps they\u2019d let him off lessons today, and he could sleep. It was the summer holiday\u2019s anyway, and not fair that he had to do lessons when all the other boys were allowed to spend all day dossing about, playing football or watching telly. Sitting up, he stretched carefully, paying attention to every ache and pop of his joints. There was a fresh claw mark behind his left ear, and a deep bite in his right thigh.\nHe rubbed his hand over his scalp, where his hair was shaved very close to his head and bristled against his fingers. He hated it, but every boy at the children\u2019s home had the same severe buzz cut. It meant that when they were allowed out in town on weekends everyone knew they were St. Edmund\u2019s boys \u2013 which was probably the point. The shopkeepers knew who to look out for. Not that the boys themselves did anything to subvert expectations. They had been told so often that they were the dregs of society; left behind and unwanted \u2013 so why not cause a little havoc?\nRemus heard footsteps at the end of the hall. It was Matron; he could smell her, hear her heartbeat. His senses were always amplified after one of his episodes. He stood up, pulling a blanket around himself despite the heat, and padded towards the door to listen harder. She was not alone, there was a man with her. He smelled old and somehow\u2026 different. A thick, iron scent which reminded Remus vaguely of his father. It was magic.\n\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s worth your time?\u201d Matron was asking the stranger, \u201cHe\u2019s really one of our worst cases.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d The old man replied. His voice was rich and warm like chocolate. \u201cWe\u2019re very sure. Is this where you keep him during\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cHis episodes.\u201d The matron finished in her clipped, nasal voice. \u201cFor his own safety. He\u2019s started biting, since his last birthday.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d The man replied, sounding thoughtful, rather than concerned. \u201cMay I ask, madam, what it is you know about the young man\u2019s affliction?\u201d\n\u201cEverything I need to know.\u201d Matron replied, coldly. \u201cHe\u2019s been here since he was five. And he\u2019s always been trouble \u2013 not just because he\u2019s one of your sort.\u201d\n\u201cMy sort?\u201d The man replied, calm and unperturbed. Matron lowered her voice almost to a whisper, but Remus could still hear.\n\u201cMy brother was one. Haven\u2019t seen him in years of course, but he occasionally asks me favours. St Edmund's is a very special institution. We\u2019re equipped for problem cases.\u201d Remus heard the jangle of keys, \u201cNow, you must let me see him first. He often needs patching up. I don\u2019t know why you wanted to see him after a full moon in the first place, if you already knew.\u201d\nThe old man did not reply, and Matron walked towards Remus\u2019 room, her patent leather heels clicking on the stone floor. She knocked on the door three times.\n\u201cLupin? Are you awake?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He replied, pulling his blanket tighter. They took his clothes off him to stop them getting torn.\n\u201cYes, Matron.\u201d Matron corrected him, through the door.\n\u201cYes, Matron.\u201d Remus muttered, as the key turned in the lock and creaked open. The door was plain wood, and he knew he could easily smash it during an episode, but it had been fitted with silver plating after the window incident. Just the smell of it made him feel queasy and headachy. The door opened. Light poured in like water and he blinked wildly. As Matron entered the room he automatically took a step back.\nShe was a birdlike, pointy sort of woman, with a long thin nose and dark beady eyes. She regarded him warily.\n\u201cNeed any bandages, this time?\u201d\nHe showed her his wounds. They weren\u2019t bleeding any more, he\u2019d noticed that the injuries he inflicted upon himself, though deep, healed faster than any other cuts and scrapes; he never even needed stitches. The scars never faded, however, and left silvery slash marks across his body. Matron knelt before him, dabbing him with antiseptic and wrapping him in itchy gauze. This done, she handed him his clothes and he dressed quickly in front of her.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve a visitor.\u201d She said, finally, as he pulled his t-shirt over his head. It was grey, like all of their clothes.\n\u201cWho?\u201d He asked, looking her in the eye because he knew she didn\u2019t like it.\n\u201cA teacher. He\u2019s here to talk to you about school.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t want to.\u201d He replied. He hated school. \u201cTell him to get lost.\u201d\nMatron clipped him around the ear. He\u2019d expected it, and didn\u2019t flinch.\n\u201cLess of the lip.\u201d She snapped. \u201cYou\u2019ll do as you\u2019re told or I\u2019ll leave you in here for the rest of the day. Come on, now.\u201d She grabbed his arms and pulled him forward.\nHe scowled, thought about fighting her off, but there was no point. She really might lock in him again, and he was curious about the stranger now. Especially as the scent of magic grew stronger as they moved down the shadowy corridor.\nThe man waiting for them was quite tall and dressed in the strangest suit Remus has ever seen. It was velvet, a deep maroon colour with elaborate gold embroidery at the cuffs and lapels. His tie was midnight blue. He must have been very old indeed \u2013 his hair was white as snow, and he had an incredible long beard which must have reached his navel. Strange as he looked, Remus didn\u2019t feel intimidated, as he did with most grownups. The man had kind eyes, and smiled at Remus from behind half-moon spectacles as they approached. He extended a hand,\n\u201cMr Lupin,\u201d The old man said, warmly, \u201cA pleasure to meet you.\u201d\nRemus stared, entranced. No one had ever addressed him with such respect before. He felt almost embarrassed. He shook the man\u2019s hand, feeling a an electric burn as he did so, like battery acid.\n\u201cHi.\u201d He replied, staring.\n\u201cI am Professor Dumbledore. I wonder if you would join me in a turn about the grounds? It\u2019s such a lovely day out.\u201d\nRemus glanced up at Matron, who nodded. This in itself was worth having to talk about school with an oddly dressed stranger \u2013 she never let him outside during a full moon, not even with supervision.\nThey carried on down a few more corridors, just the two of them. Remus was sure he\u2019d never seen Dumbledore at St Edmund\u2019s before, but he certainly seemed to know his way around. Once they were finally outside, Remus breathed deeply, the warm summer sunlight washing over him. The \u2018grounds\u2019, as Dumbledore had called them, were not extensive. A patch of yellowing grass the boys used for football and a small patio terrace with weeds growing up through the cracks in the crazy paving.\n\u201cHow are you feeling, Mr Lupin?\u201d The old man asked. Remus shrugged. He felt the same way he always did afterwards. Sore and restless. Dumbledore didn\u2019t snap at him for insolence, merely continued to smile down at him as they walked slowly around the perimeter fence.\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you want?\u201d Remus finally asked, kicking a stone out of his way.\n\u201cI suspect you already have some idea,\u201d Dumbledore replied. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a brown paper bag. Remus could smell sherbet lemon, and sure enough, Dumbledore offered him a sweet. He took it and sucked.\n\u201cYou\u2019re magic.\u201d He said, plainly. \u201cLike my dad.\u201d\n\u201cDo you remember your father, Remus?\u201d\nHe shrugged again. He didn\u2019t very well. All his memory could ever drag up was the shape of a tall, skinny man wearing a long cloak, looming over him, crying. He assumed that had been the night he was bitten. He remembered that, well enough.\n\u201cHe was magic.\u201d Remus said. \u201cHe could make stuff happen. Mum was normal.\u201d\nDumbledore smiled at him, kindly.\n\u201cIs that what your Matron has told you?\u201d\n\u201cSome of it. Some of it I knew. He\u2019s dead, anyway, topped himself.\u201d\nDumbledore looked slightly taken aback by this, which pleased Remus. It was a point of pride, having a tragic backstory. He didn\u2019t think about his father often, other than to consider whether he would have killed himself if Remus hadn\u2019t been bitten. He carried on.\n\u201cMum\u2019s not dead though. Just didn\u2019t want me. So I\u2019m here.\u201d He looked around. Dumbledore had stopped walking. They were at the furthest edge of the grounds now, by the tall back fence. There was a loose board there which no one knew about. Remus could slip through it if he wanted to, and get onto the main road into town. He never really went anywhere in particular; just wandered around waiting for the police to pick him up and bring him back. It was better than doing nothing.\n\u201cDo you like it here?\u201d Dumbledore was asking. Remus snorted,\n\u201c\u2019Course I bloody don\u2019t.\u201d He side-eyed Dumbledore, but didn\u2019t get in trouble for swearing.\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think so.\u201d The old man observed, \u201cI hear you\u2019re something of a troublemaker, is that right?\u201d\n\u201cAin\u2019t any worse than the others.\u201d Remus said. \u201cWe\u2019re \u2018troubled boys\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I see.\u201d Dumbledore stroked his beard as if Remus has said something of extreme significance.\n\u201cGot another sweet?\u201d Remus held out a hand expectantly. Dumbledore handed him the bag and he couldn\u2019t believe his luck. The old fool was a complete pushover. He chewed the lozenge this time, feeling it crunch like glass between his teeth, sherbet exploding on his tongue like fireworks.\n\u201cI run a school, you know. The same school your father went to.\u201d\nThat threw Remus for a loop. He swallowed the sweet and scratched his head. Dumbledore continued.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very special sort of school. For wizards, like me. And like you. Would you like to learn magic, Remus?\u201d\nRemus shook his head, fervently.\n\u201cI\u2019m too thick.\u201d He said, firmly, \u201cI won\u2019t get in.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s not true at all.\u201d\n\u201cAsk her,\u201d Remus jerked his head back towards the tall grey building where Matron lay in wait. \u201cCan\u2019t hardly read, even. I\u2019m stupid.\u201d\nDumbledore looked at him for a very long time.\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t had a very easy start in life, Mr Lupin, and I\u2019m sorry about that. I knew your father \u2013 only a little \u2013 and I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t have wanted\u2026 anyway. I am here to offer you something different. A place among your own kind. Perhaps even a way to channel all of this anger you have.\u201d\nRemus stared at him. What difference did it make, if he was in one home or another? Matron never gave him sweets, and didn\u2019t smell like magic. The kids at Dumbledore\u2019s school couldn\u2019t be worse than the St Edmund\u2019s boys, and if they were then at least he could hold his own in a fight, now. But. There was always a \u2018but\u2019.\n\u201cWhat about my episodes?\u201d He asked, folding his arms. \u201cI\u2019m dangerous, y\u2019know.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Remus, I know,\u201d Dumbledore replied, sadly. He placed a hand on Remus\u2019 shoulder, very gently. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what we can come up with. Leave it with me.\u201d\nRemus shook him off and chewed on another sherbet lemon. They walked back to the building in silence, both satisfied that they understood each other now."

            "content": "Remus rubbed his scalp again, then his nose, which kept running. It had been bothering him since dinner the evening before, when another boy had punched him. To be fair, Remus had kicked him first. But the boy \u2013 Malcolm White \u2013 was fourteen and twice the size of eleven-year-old Remus. Malcolm had made some crack about Remus going to a special school for backwards kids, and he\u2019d had to retaliate. He had a black eye now, which he regretted. Everyone at the new school would think he was a yob. But then, he supposed he was a yob.\nMatron slapped his hand away from his head and he scowled up at her. They stood in the huge ticket hall at King\u2019s Cross staring at two platform numbers. There was number nine, then number ten. Matron looked at the letter in her hand again.\n\u201cFor goodness sake.\u201d She muttered.\n\u201cWe have to run at the barriers.\u201d Remus said, \u201cI told you.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d Matron said, \u201cI\u2019m not running at anything.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll go, then. Leave me here.\u201d\nRemus had only half believed Dumbledore when he\u2019d explained how to access platform 9 \u00be. But then packages had started arriving for him, delivered by owls and containing strange books and weird clothes and all sorts of oddments like quills and parchment. Dumbledore had been unfailingly generous over the past month. He\u2019d presented Remus with a list of things he would need for his new school, and promised to send him as much of it as he could from the second hand supplies at Hogwarts. Now Remus was willing to believe almost anything the old man said.\nHe\u2019d never owned so many possessions before, and was actually glad when Matron had locked everything in her office so it wouldn\u2019t get pinched by the other boys. Now it had all been crammed into a battered old charity shop suitcase which he had to hold in a very particular way so it didn\u2019t fall apart.\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you anywhere, Lupin. Just wait there while I find a guard.\u201d Matron clipped off towards the ticket office, her big backside wobbling as she went. Remus glanced about furtively, then licked his lips. It might be his only chance.\nHe ran at the barrier at full pelt, squeezing his eyes shut tight as he approached the metal turnstiles. But he didn\u2019t hit anything. The atmosphere changed, and he opened his eyes to find himself standing on a completely different platform, surrounded by people. Not people. Wizards.\nThe train itself was huge, gorgeous and old fashioned. \u2018The Hogwarts Express\u2019. He clutched his suitcase with both hands, biting his lip. There were lots of other children, his own age and older, but they were all with their families, some of them crying as they were hugged and kissed by protective mothers. He felt very small and very alone, and thought it best to just hurry up and get on the train.\nInside he couldn\u2019t reach the luggage rack to stow away his things, so he chose an empty carriage and sat the suitcase on the seat beside him. He watched the people on the platform through the window, pressing his forehead against the cold glass. He wondered if they all came from wizard families too. He wondered of any of them had episodes like he did. He didn\u2019t think so \u2013 none of them seemed to have scars. A lot of them were wearing normal clothes, like he was (albeit with fewer holes and patches), but some were wearing long dark robes and tall pointed hats. Lots of the other kids had owls, or cats carried in baskets. He even saw one girl with a tiny lizard perched on her shoulder.\nRemus was starting to feel even more nervous, his stomach roiling as he realised that despite everything Dumbledore had said about being among his \u2018own kind\u2019, he would be just as out of place at Hogwarts as he was everywhere else.\nJust then, he realised that someone was staring back at him from the platform. It was another boy, his own age. He was tall and slim, but not skinny like Remus. He had dark hair, much longer than any other boy he\u2019d ever seen, curling gracefully to his shoulders. He had fine high cheekbones, a full mouth and startling blue eyes. Seeing Remus staring, the other boy arched one perfect eyebrow in a gesture that clearly said: \u2018and what are\nyou\nlooking at?\u2019\nRemus stuck his tongue under his bottom lip so that his chin bulged, pulling an ugly face. The other boy smirked, slightly, then threw up two fingers at him. Remus almost laughed.\n\u201cSirius, what do you think you are\ndoing\n?! Come here at once.\u201d A rather severe looking witch with the same angular eyebrows as the boy stepped into view, yanking her son away from the window. The boy rolled his eyes but obeyed, and they disappeared further up the platform.\nRemus sat back in the beaten leather seat and sighed. He was getting hungry, he hoped the journey wasn\u2019t too long. Matron had packed him two dry cheese and pickle sandwiches and an apple, but he didn\u2019t fancy them much.\nAfter a few more minutes, the door to his compartment burst open, and a girl came rushing in. She ignored Remus, flying to the window, pressing her hands against the glass and waving frantically at her family standing on the platform. She was small and pale, with bright red hair pulled back in a tight plait. Her face was blotchy from crying.\nShe kept waving as the train drew away, and her parents waved back, blowing kisses. A sour faced girl stood beside them, her arms folded. Once the train had completely left the station, the red haired girl sat down opposite Remus, sighing deeply. She looked at him with huge green eyes, glistening with tears.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so horrid saying goodbye, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She had a high, middle class accent.\n\u201cUh, yeah, I s\u2019pose.\u201d Remus nodded, self-conscious. He didn\u2019t really like girls. St Eddy\u2019s was single -sex, and the only contact he had with women was the Matron and the school nurse \u2013 they were both mean old bitches. The girl was looking at him curiously.\n\u201cAre you from a muggle family, too? My name\u2019s Lily.\u201d\n\u201cRemus,\u201d he replied, awkwardly, \u201cMy dad was a wizard, but I didn\u2019t know him\u2026 well I grew up with muggles.\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it when I got my letter,\u201d she smiled, warmly, cheering up, \u201cBut I can\u2019t wait to see what it\u2019s like, can you?\u201d\nRemus couldn\u2019t think how to answer her \u2013 but he didn\u2019t have to. The door slid open once more and a boy poked his head in. He had long black hair, like the boy Remus had pulled faces at, but it was poker straight. He had a long nose and wore a deep frown.\n\u201cThere you are, Lily, I\u2019ve been looking ages.\u201d He said, giving Remus a dirty look, the sort Remus was quite used to.\n\u201cSev!\u201d Lily jumped out of her seat and threw her arms around the other boy, \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you!\u201d\nHe patted her shoulder, shyly, his cheeks slightly pink.\n\u201cCome and sit in my carriage, there\u2019s plenty of room.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Lily looked back, \u201cCan Remus come? He\u2019s all by himself.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d The other boy, Sev, looked Remus up and down, taking him in piece by piece. The thuggish haircut, the fraying jeans, the worn out t-shirt, the second hand suitcase. \u201cThere might not be\nthat\nmuch room.\u201d\nRemus slouched down in his seat, propping his feet up on the bench opposite.\n\u201cGet lost then. I don\u2019t want to go to your stupid carriage.\u201d He looked out of the window, purposefully.\nLily and the other boy left. Remus let his feet drop back to the floor. He sighed. It was noisy, outside his little compartment. He could hear shrieking and laughter and owls hooting and a few younger students still crying. Once again, he found himself locked away from everyone else. He was starting to wonder if that was just his lot in life. Perhaps once he got to this Hogwarts place they\u2019d force him to sleep in a cell all by himself too.\nThere was a sudden rap at the door \u2013 a short, cheerful tune \u2013 and it opened once more. Remus slouched even further down in his seat, as a friendly faced boy with a mess of dark hair and large round glasses entered, grinning.\n\u201cHiya,\u201d He held out a hand to Remus, \u201cFirst year? Me too, I\u2019m James.\u201d He nodded his head back to a short boy who had followed him in. \u201cThis is Peter.\u201d\nRemus shook James\u2019 hand. It felt easy and comfortable. For the first time, the tight coil in his stomach began to unwind.\n\u201cRemus.\u201d\n\u201cCan we sit here? Everywhere else is full and Peter\u2019s getting train sick.\u201d\n\u201cAm not.\u201d Peter murmured, taking a seat opposite Remus, eyeing him warily. He did look a bit green. He rubbed his hands together in his lap and stared at the floor.\n\u201cKnow what house you\u2019ll be in?\u201d James asked Remus, directly. Remus shook his head. He didn\u2019t know anything about houses. Was that where they\u2019d be sleeping? \u201cWhat were your parents in?\u201d James persisted. \u201cDid they go to Hogwarts?\u201d\nRemus nodded, slowly,\n\u201cMy dad did. I dunno what house though. My mum didn\u2019t. She was nor\u2014a muggle.\u201d\nPeter looked up suddenly,\n\u201cYou\u2019re a half blood?\u201d\nRemus shrugged helplessly.\n\u201cShut up, Pettigrew,\u201d James chastised the boy next to him, \u201cAs if it even matters.\u201d\nRemus was just about to ask what a half blood was, when the door opened yet again. It was the good looking boy who\u2019d sworn at him in the station. He glanced about, furtively,\n\u201cNone of you are related to me, are you?\u201d He drawled. He had the same high, upper class accent that Peter and James had. Remus disliked them all at once, knowing that they\u2019d think he was common \u2013 and a half blood, whatever that was.\n\u201cDon\u2019t think so.\u201d James replied, grinning, \u201cJames Potter.\u201d He held out a hand again. The other boy shook it, easily,\n\u201cOh good, a Potter. Dad told me not to talk to you.\u201d He sat down next to Remus, grinning, \u201cSirius Black.\u201d"

            "content": "Remus was fairly sure he was dreaming. Or he\u2019d drowned getting over that awful lake and this was just his brain making things up before he died. He was standing in an enormous stone hall, the size of a cathedral. It was full of students, all dressed in identical black robes \u2013 apart from their ties \u2013 and lit by candles. Not just any candles \u2013 these candles were actually floating. He might have been able to live with that; it could be a clever trick of the light, something to do with wires. But when he looked up he almost yelled. There was no ceiling \u2013 just the vast night sky hanging above them, pendulous grey clouds and glittering stars.\nNo one else seemed interested, save for the red haired girl \u2013 Lily \u2013 and a few other kids Remus assumed must have muggle parents too. Remus had on his uniform now, and felt a little better to be dressed the same as everyone else. All of the other students sat on long banquet tables, under their house banners. James had excitedly explained the differences between each house, much to the chagrin of Sirius and Peter, both of whom were convinced they\u2019d end up in the wrong place. Remus didn\u2019t know whether to be nervous or not. He couldn\u2019t see how much it would matter to him; he\u2019d probably get kicked out after his first lesson anyway. The more time Remus spent among wizards the more he convinced himself that he couldn\u2019t actually be one.\nProfessor McGonagall, a thin, stern faced witch who had led all of the first years into the hall was now standing beside a stool, holding a mangy old brown hat. This was the test James had told them about. They had to put on the hat, then somehow they would each be sorted into one of the houses. Remus looked up at each of the banners. He already knew he wouldn\u2019t end up in Ravenclaw; not if you had to be clever. He didn\u2019t think much of the one with the badger \u2013 they weren\u2019t exactly exciting animals, especially compared to snakes. He liked the colour green, too, if it came down to picking a tie. But then, James and Peter had both been keen on Gryffindor, and seeing as they were the only people who\u2019d been very friendly so far, he wouldn\u2019t mind going with them.\nA boy called Simon Arnold was the first to be called forward. The hat was placed on his head, covering the top half of his face. Remus wondered if it smelled as bad as it looked. Matron was always maniacal about head lice, and he hoped none of the kids who went before him had them. Simon was promptly sorted into Hufflepuff, the badger house, to tumultuous applause.\nSirius Black was the first of their group to go, and he looked positively queasy as he approached the stool. There was some catcalling from the Slytherin table \u2013 some of the older students were calling out to him. Two young women with masses of dark curls and the same high cheekbones and full lips at Sirius, who was now trembling on the stool. The hall was quiet for a few moments as the hat came to rest on Black\u2019s head. Then the hat screeched,\n\u201cGryffindor!\u201d\nA few moments of stunned silence before the clapping came this time. McGonagall gently lifted the hat from Sirius\u2019 head and gave him a small, rare smile. He looked completely horrified, casting a desperate look at the Slytherin table, where the two girls heckling him were hissing, eyes narrowed. He got up and walked slowly over to the Gryffindors, where he was the first new student to take his place under the red and gold banners.\nThe sorting continued. Lily was also placed in Gryffindor, and sat grinning next to a very miserable looking Sirius. When it was finally his turn, Remus still couldn\u2019t see what all the fuss was about. He didn\u2019t much like having everyone\u2019s eyes on him as he pushed to the front, but his did his best to ignore it. He would have shoved his hands in his jeans and slouched, normally, but in his weird new uniform it wouldn\u2019t have had the same effect.\nHe sat on the school, McGonagall looking down her nose at him. She reminded him a bit of Matron, and disgust rose in his throat. She lowered the hat over his eyes. Everything went dark. It didn\u2019t smell at all, and the peace and quiet was actually a bit of a relief.\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d A soft voice spoke in his ear. It was the hat. Remus tried not to cringe as it purred quietly, \u201cYou\u2019re an odd one, aren\u2019t you? What\nshall\nwe do with you\u2026 perhaps Ravenclaw? There\u2019s a good brain in here.\u201d\nRemus flinched, feeling as if someone was playing a joke on him. Not bloody likely.\n\u201cBut then,\u201d the hat considered, \u201cYou might go further\u2026 much further, if we put you in\u2026 GRYFFINDOR!\u201d\nRemus ripped the hat from his head as soon as it had sorted him, not waiting for McGonagall to remove it. He hurried over to the Gryffindor table, barely registering the cheering and clapping as he passed. He sat opposite Lily and Sirius. Lily shot him a pleased smile, but he just looked at his empty plate.\nBy the time the \u2018P\u2019s\u2019 came around, Remus had somewhat recovered and was able to watch with some interest as Peter, a small, pudgy looking boy hurried towards the sorting hat. Peter was the sort of boy who wouldn\u2019t last five minutes at St Eddy\u2019s. He had a perpetually nervous, twitchy look that other boys always singled out. Remus was surprised that James \u2013 who was the polar opposite of Peter; relaxed and self-assured, brimming with confidence \u2013 was being so kind to someone so obviously inferior.\nThe hat took a very long time over Peter. Even the teachers seemed to be getting nervous, as the minutes ticked by. Finally, he was sorted into Gryffindor, and much more quickly so was James, who strode over to the table with a huge grin on his face.\n\u201cHow great is that!\u201d He addressed the three other boys, \u201cWe all made it!\u201d\nSirius groaned, his head in his arms on the table.\n\u201cSpeak for yourself,\u201d He replied, slightly muffled, \u201cMy Father\u2019s going to kill me.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Peter kept saying, eyes wide. Though he\u2019d clearly got what he wanted, he kept wringing his hands and shooting looks over his shoulder as if someone might come over at any moment and ask him to try again.\nMcGonagall did come over, but she placed a bony hand on Remus\u2019 shoulder.\n\u201cMr Lupin,\u201d she said, quietly, but not so quietly that the other boys couldn\u2019t hear, \u201cIf you would come to my office after dinner? It\u2019s next to the Gryffindor common room, one of the prefects can show you.\u201d\nRemus nodded, mute, and she left.\n\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d James asked, \u201cMcGonagall wants to see you already?\u201d\nEven Sirius looked up now, curious. Remus shrugged, as if he didn\u2019t care either way. He knew what they were thinking \u2013 the rough kid was already in trouble. Sirius was looking at his black eye again. Fortunately, the food had appeared, distracting everyone. And it really had \u2018appeared\u2019 \u2013 the previously empty places were suddenly laden with an actual feast. Golden roasted chickens, piles of crispy roast potatoes, plates of steaming carrots, peas swimming in butter, and an enormous jug of rich dark gravy. If the food was going to be like this all the time, then Remus wondered if he could ignore talking hats and snobbish house mates.\nHe paid very close attention as one of the Gryffindor prefects, who introduced himself as Frank Longbottom, led the first years to their common room in one of the towers. Remus hated getting lost, and tried hard to cement the journey into his mind as they went. He made a mental note of the size and shape of every door they entered, each portrait they passed, and which staircases moved. He was so tired and full of good food that the moving portraits and staircases no longer seemed out of place.\nOnce they reached the right corridor, Remus saw McGonagall\u2019s office, marked with a neat brass plaque, and decided to get the meeting over with. He paused outside the door and was just about to knock when James appeared,\n\u201cWant us to wait for you, mate?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Remus asked, eyeing the dark haired boy suspiciously. James shrugged,\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t end up on your own.\u201d\nRemus stared at him for a moment, before slowly shaking his head,\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine.\u201d He knocked.\n\u201cEnter.\u201d A voice came from within. Remus pushed open the door. The office was small, with a neat little fireplace and rows of books against one wall. McGonagall sat behind an immaculately tidy desk. She smiled thinly and motioned for Remus to sit down in the chair opposite. He did, sniffing and rubbing his nose.\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you, Mr Lupin.\u201d The teacher said in a reedy Scottish accent. Her hair was grey, pulled back in a severe bun, and she wore deep green robes secured with a golden clasp shaped like a lion\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019m even more pleased to have you in Gryffindor house \u2013 of which I am the head.\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cYour father was in Ravenclaw, you know.\u201d\nRemus shrugged. McGonagall pursed her lips.\n\u201cI thought it best to speak with you as soon as possible about your\u2026 condition.\u201d She said, quietly, \u201cDumbledore has explained that you have had minimal interaction with the wizarding world so far, and I feel it is my duty to let you know that people with your particular problem face a huge amount of stigma. Do you know what \u2018stigma\u2019 means?\u201d\nRemus nodded. He couldn\u2019t spell it, but he knew the word well enough.\n\u201cI want you to know that as long as you are in my house, I will not tolerate anyone treating you differently or unkindly. This applies to all of the students under my care. However,\u201d She cleared her throat, \u201cIt may be prudent for you to exercise caution.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to tell anyone.\u201d Remus replied, \u201cAs if I want anyone knowing.\u201d\n\u201cWell, quite.\u201d McGonagall nodded, looking at him curiously. \u201cThat brings me to my next point. Arrangements have been made for the full moon \u2013 which next occurs this Sunday, I believe. If you could report to me after dinner, I shall show you where to go. Perhaps you could tell your friends that you\u2019re visiting someone at home?\u201d\nRemus snorted. He rubbed the back of his head,\n\u201cCan I go now?\u201d\nThe professor nodded, frowning slightly.\nOutside, Remus found James still standing there, alone, waiting for him.\n\u201cTold you I\u2019d be ok.\u201d Remus said, annoyed. James just smiled,\n\u201cYeah, but you missed Longbottom giving us the password. Didn\u2019t want you stuck out here all night. C\u2019mon.\u201d\nJames led him to the end of the corridor, where hung a large painting of a voluptuous woman wearing pink.\n\u201cWiddershins.\u201d James said, and the portrait moved away, swinging out like a door. They entered the common room.\nThere had been a rec room at St Edmund\u2019s Boys Reformatory, but it was nothing like this. That room had been sparsely decorated, containing a black and white, too small TV and a few board games. The decks of cards were always incomplete, and most of the chairs were broken or damaged.\nThe Gryffindor common room was warm, comfortable and cosy. There were huge squashy looking sofas and armchairs, a thick maroon rug in front of the blazing fire, and even more paintings adorning the walls.\n\u201cWe\u2019re up here,\u201d James said, leading Remus to a winding staircase in one corner. At the top, there was another door which opened into a bedroom. Again, this was nothing like the facilities at St Edmunds. There were four beds, all enormous, hung with thick red velvet curtains with gold trim tassels. There was another fireplace, and each boy had a heavy mahogany trunk and set of shelves by their beds. Remus saw his sad little suitcase propped up against one of the trunks. He moved over, assuming that was his bed.\nPeter was rifling through his own things, pulling out clothes and magazines and books, making a terrible mess.\n\u201cI can\u2019t find my wand,\u201d he wailed. \u201cMum made me pack it so I wouldn\u2019t lose it on the train, but it\u2019s not here!\u201d\n\u201cPete,\u201d James grinned, \u201cYour mum asked me to look after it, remember?\u201d\nJames and Peter, Remus had learnt since the train, had grown up as neighbours and knew each other quite well. Though two boys couldn\u2019t be any more different, and Remus still didn\u2019t understand why James didn\u2019t want to beat the shit out of Peter.\nSirius was sitting on his bed, his trunk still packed.\n\u201cCheer up, mate,\u201d James said, going to sit next to him, \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to be in Slytherin anyway, did you?\u201d\n\u201cFive hundred years.\u201d Sirius replied, stonily, \u201cEvery Black at Hogwarts has been sorted into Slytherin for five hundred years.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s about time someone tried to be different, eh?\u201d James slapped him on the back jovially.\nRemus opened his trunk. Inside there was a large pewter cauldron \u2013 another item Dumbledore had scrounged up from the second hand bin, he imagined. There was also a long thin box at the bottom, with a note on top.\nHe unfolded the note and stared at the elaborate swirly script for a long time, trying to make sense of it. He only recognised the word \u2018father\u2019, and guessed that it was also from Dumbledore, but had belonged to his father. Opening it eagerly, he found a long, polished stick. It was a wand. He hadn\u2019t thought about wands yet, but he took it in his hand and squeezed the wood firmly. It was warm to the touch, like his own flesh, and felt supple as he turned it in his hands. It felt good.\nSirius had finally started to unpack, pulling book after book out of his trunk. Those that didn\u2019t fit on his shelf he stacked beside his bed. James stared, having just finished pinning a poster next to his own bed. It showed a lot of little people zooming about on broomsticks, throwing balls to each other. Remus thought it looked only mildly more interesting than football, which he hated.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d James said to Sirius, still stacking books, \u201cThere is a library here.\u201d\nSirius smirked,\n\u201cI know, but these are mostly muggle books. My Uncle Alphard left them to me, and mum would set them all on fire if I left them at home.\u201d\nRemus\u2019 ears pricked at that. What was wrong with muggle books? Not that he had any with him. He hated reading more than anything in the world. He didn\u2019t think about it for long, though, because now Sirius was lifting an actual record player out of his trunk, followed by a box of brand new looking records in shining bright sleeves. He went over to look straight away,\n\u201cIs that Abbey Road?!\u201d He asked, peering into the box of vinyl.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius grinned, handing it to him. Remus wiped his hands carefully on his robes before taking it from him, handling it carefully. \u201cYou must be muggle born.\u201d Sirius said, \u201cNever met a wizard who knows the Beatles \u2013 except my cousin, Andromeda. She bought them for me.\u201d\nRemus nodded, forgetting himself for a moment,\n\u201cI love The Beatles, one of the boys in my room at home\u2019s got at least ten singles, but he never lets me touch them.\u201d\n\u201cBoys at home?\u201d Sirius arched an eyebrow. Remus thought he seemed very grown up, \u201cYou mean your brother?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Remus shook his head, handing back the record and shrinking away, \u201cI live in a children\u2019s home.\u201d\n\u201cLike an orphanage?\u201d Peter asked, wide-eyed. Remus felt anger rising, his ears growing hot.\n\u201cNo.\u201d He spat. He felt all of the boys\u2019 eyes slide towards his bruise again and turned around to unpack the rest of his things in silence.\nEventually Potter and Black started up a conversation about something called\nquidditch\n, which soon became a very heated argument. Remus climbed onto his bed and drew back the curtains, relishing the privacy. It was dark, but Remus was used to the dark.\n\u201cYou\u2019d think he\u2019d try harder to make friends,\u201d Peter whispered loudly to the other two boys. \u201cEspecially if he\u2019s muggle born.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure the hat wasn\u2019t supposed to put\nyou\nin Slytherin?\u201d Sirius drawled. Peter was quiet after that."

            "content": "Sunday, 5th September 1971\nRemus got through the rest of the week by ignoring the other boys as much as he could. This was a technique he\u2019d picked up at St Edmund\u2019s \u2013 it was better not to be noticed, and best if no one knew anything about you at all. (He still got the odd dead-arm or his head shoved in the bogs, but on the whole no one ever made an effort to bother him.) James, Sirius and Peter were not at all like St Eddy\u2019s boys, of course. They were what Matron would call \u2018well-bred\u2019.\nSirius and James especially seemed to come from money, he could tell from the way they talked about their homes, as well as the way they spoke \u2013 every vowel and consonant clearly pronounced. Remus listened carefully and resolved to stop dropping his \u2018H\u2019s\u2019.\nIt wasn\u2019t just their accents, but\nwhat\nthey said. Remus had grown up with adults constantly telling him to \u2018be quiet!\u2019, and with boys who picked on you for being a swot if you said any more words than necessary. James and Sirius spoke like characters in a novel; their language full of descriptive metaphor and scathing sarcasm. Their rapid fire wit was much more intimidating than a punch in the face, Remus thought \u2013 at least that was over quickly.\nHe\u2019d so far avoided the other boys by going for walks around the castle. At St Edmund\u2019s he\u2019d had very little personal liberty, and spent much of his time locked in rooms. At Hogwarts it seemed there was nowhere you couldn\u2019t go, and Remus was determined to investigate every inch of the bizarre landscape.\nThey\u2019d been provided with maps to help them find their classrooms, but Remus found his sorely lacking and overly simplified. It did not list, for example, a secret passageway he had found which led from the dungeons to the first floor girl\u2019s loos. He had no idea why on earth anyone would need to get between the two, and the first time he used it he was accosted by a particularly irritating ghost who squirted him with hand soap. It would also have been helpful, Remus reasoned, to animate the map in the same way the paintings were \u2013 then at least you could keep track of the ridiculous moving staircases. He was sure one of the rooms moved as well, it never seemed to be in quite the same place.\nBy the time Sunday afternoon rolled around Remus was dreading Monday, which would not only be the first day after the full moon, but the first day of lessons. After dinner \u2013 which Remus spent alone, a few seats away from Sirius, James and Peter \u2013 he made his way quickly to McGonagall\u2019s office. She was waiting for him, along with the school nurse, who he\u2019d been introduced to already. She was a kind, pleasant sort of woman; if a little fussy.\n\u201cGood evening, Mr Lupin,\u201d McGonagall smiled, \u201cThank you for being so prompt. Come along.\u201d\nTo Remus\u2019 surprise, the two women led him not to the dungeons, as he\u2019d thought they might, but outside the castle, towards a very large twisted tree. The whomping willow was a recent addition to the grounds \u2013 Dumbledore had explained in his speech at the beginning of the year that it had been donated by an ex-pupil. Remus thought that whoever had donated it must have really hated the school, because the tree was not only terrifying in aspect, but mindlessly violent.\nAs they approached, Professor McGonagall did something so incredible that Remus almost cried out in shock. She seemed to vanish \u2013 shrinking down suddenly, until she was no longer there at all. In her place was a sleek yellow eyed tabby cat. Madam Pomfrey gave no sign that she was surprised, as the cat ran forward towards the tree, which was flailing its branches like a child having a tantrum. The cat was able to run right up to the trunk of the tree, escaping injury, and pressed a paw against one of the knots in the bark. The tree fell instantly still. Remus and Madam Pomfrey continued on, walking into a hollow beneath the tree which Remus had never noticed before. Inside, McGonagall was waiting for them, a witch again.\nThe passageway was dimly lit by torches giving off a greenish glow, and at the very end was a door. This opened into a small cottage, which looked long abandoned. The windows were boarded up and the doors bolted.\n\u201cHere we are.\u201d McGonagall tried to sound pleasant, though it seemed a very grim place. \u201cNow I hope you understand that we cannot stay with you, but if you would like Madam Pomfrey to wait outside until the\u2026 transformation is complete?\u201d\nRemus shrugged.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be ok. How do I get back in the morning?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll pop by as soon as the sun rises,\u201d Madam Pomfrey assured him. \u201cPatch you up and have you off to your lessons before anyone even notices you\u2019re gone.\u201d She smiled, but her eyes looked sad. It made Remus uncomfortable. But then, it was getting to that point in the evening when everything made him uncomfortable, his hair itched, his skin felt too tight, his temperature rose.\n\u201cYou\u2019d better go.\u201d He said, quickly, retreating into the bare room. There was a little cot against one wall with clean sheets. It looked as though it had been put there for him.\nThe two women left, locking the door heavily behind him. He heard McGonagall muttering again and wondered what sort of spells she was placing on the house. Whatever they were, it was better than that awful silver plating.\nHe sat on the bed for a moment, then got up again, restless. He paced the room. Sometimes it felt as though the wolf crept into his mind before it got hold of his body, and as darkness fell outside his senses became sharper, the hot swell of hunger beginning in his belly. Remus removed his clothes quickly, not wanting to rip them. A dull throb started up in his joints and he lay down on the bed. This was the worst part. His heartbeat was thudding in his ears, and he could swear he heard his tendons creaking as they stretched, his bones and teeth grinding against each other as they elongated, his skull splitting and reshaping.\nHe groaned and hissed until the pain grew too much, then he screamed. He could only hope that he was far enough from the school that no one could hear him. All in all, it took about twenty minutes \u2013 though he\u2019d never actually timed it. Things became foggy afterwards, he couldn\u2019t always remember what happened once he became the wolf. That first night at Hogwarts was a blur, and he woke up with less injuries than usual. He suspected that he had sniffed around the unfamiliar territory, testing its boundaries. He must have tried to throw himself at the doors or windows at some point, because he had a patchwork of bruises down his left side for days afterwards.\nTransforming back was just as unpleasant \u2013 a crushing, tightening feeling all over which left him breathless and aching. He wiped the tears from his eyes and crawled into the cot, grateful for a quiet hour of sleep before the sun rose completely.\nMadam Pomfrey returned, as promised. Speaking in soothing tones, she lay her cool hands on his fevered brow.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the look of you,\u201d she said, as he opened his sleepy eyes, \u201cIt\u2019s madness, thinking you can start a full school day like this. You\u2019re exhausted!\u201d\nNo one had ever expressed such concern for him before, and it struck him uneasily. He pushed her away, pulling on his clothes,\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. I want to go.\u201d\nShe made him drink something before letting him get up \u2013 it tasted cold and metallic, but he did feel better afterwards. He hurried up to Gryffindor tower to get his uniform on as fast as possible \u2013 he didn\u2019t want to miss breakfast, he was famished.\n\u201cWhere were you?!\u201d James accosted him as soon as he burst into their room. The three other boys were all up and dressed, looking immaculate \u2013 apart from James\u2019 hair, which always stuck up at the back.\n\u201cNowhere.\u201d Remus pushed past to get to his things.\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d Sirius asked, glancing away from the mirror where he was smoothing down his own hair.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d James added, watching Remus carefully, \u201cYou look a bit weird.\u201d\nRemus scowled at them,\n\u201cPiss off.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re just being nice.\u201d Peter said, hands on his hips. The three of them stared at Remus, who was about to remove his t-shirt when he remembered his bruises.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d He growled at them, \u201cYou all gonna watch me get dressed? You posh boys are all a bunch of poofs.\u201d He marched into the bathroom with his clothes and slammed the door. After a few moments he heard Peter whining that he was hungry and they all left."

            "content": "Friday 10\nth\nSeptember 1971\nBy the end of his first week of lessons, Remus had lost ten house points, learnt one spell, and gained another bruise; this time on his chin.\nThe first few lessons were ok \u2013 they were introductory, and while Lily Evans spent each class furiously scribbling down pages and pages of notes, nobody else seemed too bothered. They were set a few simple pieces of homework, but Remus made a plan to pretend he\u2019d forgotten to make a note of it if anyone asked.\nCharms was the most exciting \u2013 the tiny professor enchanted a pile of pinecones to whiz around the room, to everyone\u2019s delight. After a few goes at the spell themselves, Lily had levitated her pinecone at least three feet in the air, and Sirius got his to spin like a top \u2013 until it got out of control and smashed a window. James, Peter and Remus had less luck, but Remus was sure his had jumped once or twice.\nTransfiguration was just as interesting, but much more serious, as it was led by Professor McGonagall. There would be no practical work at all during the first week, she explained, but she would be setting lots of homework in order to gauge their ability levels.\nHistory of magic was absolutely dire, and the less said about it the better. Remus struggled not to fall asleep as the ghostly Professor Binns floated up and down the aisles, reeling off dates and names of battles. He too set homework \u2013 two chapters of reading from the set text. Sirius rolled his eyes at this and muttered to James,\n\u201c\nSurely\neveryone\u2019s already finished \u2018A History of Magic\u2019? It\u2019s kids stuff.\u201d James nodded, yawning. Remus felt sick. He hadn\u2019t opened even one of the books in his trunk yet, except to rip the first page from \u2018Level One Potions\u2019 to spit his chewing gum into.\nHe\u2019d actually been looking forward to Potions, hoping to at least see something blow up, like in chemistry. But that turned out to involve a huge amount of reading too, and even worse, they had to share the class with the Slytherin first years. The Professor leading Potions was annoyingly cheerful and took almost half an hour just to read the register.\n\u201cBlack, Sirius \u2013 aha, there you are! Quite surprised at the sorting my boy, quite surprised! I\u2019ve had every one of the Blacks in my house since I started teaching! Shan\u2019t take it personally, young Sirius, but I shall be expecting great things!\u201d\nSirius looked like he wanted the ground to swallow him up. Slughorn continued calling out names,\n\u201cA Potter\nand\na Pettigrew, eh? Well, well, along with Mr Black here this class has quite the pedigree, eh? Let me see\u2026 Lupin! I knew your father; not one of mine, but a damn good dualist. Nasty business\u2026\u201d\nRemus blinked. He wondered if Slughorn knew he was a werewolf. The whole class was looking at him \u2013 they knew by now that he had been raised in a children\u2019s home, and that his father was magical (Remus suspected that Peter had told them), but no one had dared ask him much more. There seemed to be another rumour going around that he was violent and possibly in a gang. He was sure that James and Sirius were encouraging it, too, though he found he didn\u2019t mind too much.\nFortunately, Slughorn wanted to get them started on practical work as soon as possible,\n\u201cBest thing is to just get stuck in!\u201d He smiled, \u201cNow, if we all work four to a cauldron, you can all take it in turns to follow the steps\u2026\u201d\nEveryone clamoured to pair up \u2013 James, Sirius and Peter immediately claimed the cauldron at the very back of the room, and were joined by Nathaniel Quince, a Slytherin boy who knew Potter and Pettigrew from home. Remus decided he would just wait until everyone had grouped off then see if he could get away with just hovering at the back for the rest of the lesson.\nNo such luck.\n\u201cRemus! You can join us!\u201d Lily\u2019s grabbed his wrist and pulled him over to a cauldron she was sharing with Severus Snape \u2013 her long-nosed friend Remus had met on the train \u2013 and Garrick Mulciber, a brutish, snub nosed boy who Remus was a bit afraid of.\nLily was already chattering away, laying out all of the ingredients and heating up the cauldron carefully. She was looking at Severus\u2019 book, which already had notes scribbled all over the margins.\n\u201cHere\u2019re the desiccated snail-eye stems.\u201d Lily shook a tiny jar. \u201cI think we need quarter of an ounce\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou can be fairly liberal with them, Lily, they don\u2019t add much overall.\u201d Severus drawled, sounding bored.\nLily measured them out anyway and tipped them into the bubbling brew. Mulcibur then took the book and stirred for five minutes, taking instruction from Severus on how fast to go and in which direction. Then it was Remus\u2019 turn. Lily gave him the book. He stared at the page. He could see that they were instructions, he could make out maybe half of the words. But every time he thought he had a grasp on it, the letters seemed to shift on the page and he was lost all over again. His cheeks grew hot and he felt slightly sick. He shrugged, looking away,\n\u201cOh hurry\nup\n,\u201d Severus snapped, \u201cIt\u2019s not as if it\u2019s difficult.\u201d\n\u201cLeave him alone, Sev,\u201d Lily chided. \u201cThe book\u2019s covered in your notes, no wonder he can\u2019t find his place. Here, Remus,\u201d she flicked open her own, brand new potions book. But it was no good. Remus shrugged,\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you do it, if you\u2019re so clever.\u201d He spat at Severus.\n\u201cOh Merlin,\u201d Severus\u2019 lips curled, \u201cYou can\nread\n, can\u2019t you? I mean, even muggle schools teach that, surely?\u201d\n\u201cSeverus!\u201d Lily gasped, but the smug dark haired boy didn\u2019t have a chance to say anything else \u2013 Remus threw himself over the desk and into Severus, fists flying. He only had the element of surprise going for him \u2013 Mulciber grabbed his collar and yanked him back, punching him square in the face in three seconds flat.\n\u201cStop!\u201d Slughorn boomed. Everyone froze. The portly potions master stormed over, \u201cGet up, both of you!\u201d He shouted at the two boys on the floor. Snape and Remus climbed to their feet, chests heaving. Snape looked worse off by far, his hair ruffled and blood oozing from his nose. \u00a0Remus had a rather sore chin where Mulciber had hit him, but other than a rumpled uniform he was fine.\n\u201cExplain yourselves!\u201d Slughorn shouted. They both looked at their feet. Mulciber was grinning. Lily was crying. \u201cVery well,\u201d the teacher said, crossly, \u201cDetention for both of you, two weeks. Ten points from Gryffindor and ten from Slytherin.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair!\u201d James said, suddenly from the back, \u201cShould be twice as many from Slytherin, it was two against one!\u201d\n\u201cFrom where I was standing it was Mr Lupin who started it,\u201d Slughorn replied, but shook his head anyway, \u201cStill, you are quite right \u2013 Mulciber, five points for punching Remus. Violence does not solve violence, you know, as I\u2019ve told your eldest brother on a number of occasions. Miss Evans, please take Mr Snape to the hospital wing. Lupin, you can clean up the mess you\u2019ve made.\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t know any cleaning spells, so he had to mop up by hand. Slughorn even made him clean Snape\u2019s blood off the flagstones. Unfortunately, it being so soon after a full moon, the rich, iron smell of it made his stomach growl. James, Sirius and Peter were waiting for Remus outside after the lesson was finished.\n\u201cBloody brilliant, mate,\u201d James punched Remus lightly on the arm, \u201cThe way you just went for him!\u201d\n\u201cMulciber was out here bragging afterwards, told everyone what Snape said.\u201d Sirius added, \u201cYou were right to do it \u2013 what a prat.\u201d\n\u201cTold\u2026\neveryone\n?\u201d Remus moaned.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, they\u2019re all on your side.\u201d James said, \u201cWell, except the Slytherins.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and who gives a toss about the Slytherins?\u201d Sirius grinned, \u201cC\u2019mon, it\u2019s dinner soon \u2013 hungry?\u201d\n\u201cStarving,\u201d Remus grinned back."

            "content": "\u201cSo.\u201d James said on Sunday evening, \u201cHow are we going to get them back?\u201d\n\u201cGet who back?\u201d Peter asked without looking up, searching through his notes for something.\nThey were in the Gryffindor common room, trying to do their homework for McGonagall. Fourteen inches on the basic laws of transfiguration. Sirius and James had finished theirs, Peter was at least six inches in, and Remus hadn\u2019t started.\n\u201cThe Slytherins.\u201d James hissed, \u201cKeep up, Pete.\u201d\n\u201cNot\nall\nof the Slytherins,\u201d Peter asked, sounding worried, \u201cOnly Snape and Mulciber, right?\u201d\n\u201cAll of them.\u201d Sirius confirmed. He had just appeared from under the desk they were sharing, and presented a piece of parchment, \u201cThis what you were looking for?\u201d\n\u201cThanks!\u201d Peter grabbed it, relieved, \u201cI\u2019ve nearly finished\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHave you done it, Lupin?\u201d Sirius looked over. Remus had opened his book, but hadn\u2019t so much as looked at it. He\u2019d considered cloistering himself away in the library one evening and trying to read it properly \u2013 he\ncould\nread if he really, really focussed. But the opportunity hadn\u2019t presented, and if he was honest; he just didn\u2019t want to. Ever since the Potions lesson the four of them had become real friends, and Remus didn\u2019t want to miss out.\n\u201cNah,\u201d He shrugged in response to Sirius. \u201cCan\u2019t be bothered.\u201d\n\u201cLet us know if you need help.\u201d\n\u201cYou can copy mine if you want.\u201d James pushed his across the desk. Remus pushed it back, gritting his teeth.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d\n\u201cNo one said you were.\u201d James replied, casually. Sirius was looking at him, though. Remus wanted to hit him, but he was trying not to lash out so much \u2013 James and Sirius sometimes play wrestled, but they never actually tried to hurt each other, like he had with Snape. Forcing himself to swallow his temper, Remus opted instead to change the subject.\n\u201cWe could put itching powder in their beds.\u201d He offered. Someone had done that to him once. He had a rash for a full week, and on the night of the full moon had torn at his skin more than usual. \u201cOr on their clothes\u2026 if we could figure out who does the laundry, anyway.\u201d\nThis had been a matter of great concern to Remus \u2013 their dirty laundry appeared to just vanish and then resurface, cleaned and folded in their trunks. He\u2019d never caught anyone else in their room, and couldn\u2019t understand it at all.\n\u201cI like it.\u201d James replied, chewing his quill, \u201cAnyone got any itching powder, though?\u201d\nThe three boys shook their heads.\n\u201cCould order some from Zonko\u2019s.\u201d Sirius put in. \u201cIf you let me borrow your owl, James, Mum confiscated mine after the sorting.\u201d\n\u201cI s\u2019pose,\u201d James replied. \u201cWish we could do it sooner, though. You know, strike while the iron is hot.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t need to buy itching powder,\u201d Remus said, suddenly, having a brainwave, \u201cDo you reckon they have rose hips in the greenhouse?\u201d\n\u201cYep,\u201d Peter spoke, head still bowed over his homework, \u201cFor healing potions \u2013 arthritis, I think.\u201d\n\u201cThe hairs inside make you itch, really badly.\u201d Remus explained, excited, \u201cMatron \u2013 the woman who runs the children\u2019s home \u2013 she grows them, and if you get in trouble she makes you seed them without gloves on.\u201d His fingertips itched just thinking about it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s awful.\u201d James said.\n\u201cGood idea, though!\u201d Sirius grinned. \u201cNext break, we\u2019ll go and get a load of them. Then we can seed them \u2013 with gloves on \u2013 and put them in the Slytherin\u2019s bedsheets. Excellent!\u201d\n\u201cHow are we going to get into the Slytherin dorms?\u201d Peter asked, finally finishing his work.\n\u201cLeave that to me,\u201d James smirked, mercurially.\n* * *\nGetting the rose hips was easy. They sent Peter, who was the only one of them who hadn\u2019t been given a detention yet, and was therefore under the least observation. Peter was small and good at going unseen; he crept into the green house unnoticed during morning break and returned red faced and gleeful, with a jar full of rose hips under his cloak.\nThen they\u2019d all locked themselves away in their shared bathroom to seed all of the buds. Under Remus\u2019 close instruction, they all wore their heavy dragon hide gloves to do this, taking extra care not to touch the seeds or fine little hairs.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the looks on their faces.\u201d Sirius was grinning, sitting cross legged on the floor next to James.\nRemus watched, sitting on the edge of the bath tub, James and Sirius\u2019 two dark heads bowed over the work. He was a little bit jealous of their friendship. They had so much in common \u2013 being raised into magic, both growing up wealthy, both completely mad about quidditch. In addition, it was clear that after only three weeks James and Sirius had managed to secure a reputation as joint kings of the first years. Everyone listened to them when they spoke. Everyone laughed when they were funny. No one even got annoyed if they lost house points.\n\u201cI still don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to get into the Slytherin dorms \u2013 even Peter isn\u2019t that sneaky.\u201d Sirius glanced at James. He\u2019d been trying to get him to reveal his plan ever since the bespectacled boy had mentioned it.\n\u201cLet me worry about that,\u201d was all James said.\nThe seeds and hairs were then decanted into another jar, while the boys ended up eating the leftover rosehips over the course of the week.\nIt was Tuesday evening when they finally had their chance. James decided that they would have to do it before everyone went to bed. He also decided that they ought to go to the Slytherin dorms separately, to avoid being seen together and discovered. Remus personally thought this was overkill, but went along with it, not wanting to ruin the other boy\u2019s fun.\nThey ate dinner much more quickly than usual that evening, before getting up from the table one at a time and leaving the hall. Peter looked so nervous Remus thought he might panic at the last minute and give them all away. He made sure to stay close to the smaller boy, just in case he had to cover his mouth or pull him back at some point.\nSirius and James went first, of course, heading towards the girl\u2019s loo\u2019s on the second floor which Remus had told them led to the dungeons. He\u2019d thought about keeping that particular passageway to himself, but as he\u2019d already found a few other good hiding places by then he reasoned that letting them know about this one wouldn\u2019t hurt. After all, how often would he want to get to the dungeons?\nThe ghost who lived in the toilets was fortunately in a quiet mood, though Remus could hear her sobbing softly in the last stall.\n\u201cLead the way then, Lupin,\u201d James gestured grandly, once Remus and Peter arrived. Sirius grabbed his arm,\n\u201cWait, show us what you\u2019re planning, first.\u201d\nJames smirked that annoying grin he\u2019d been sporting since Sunday.\n\u201cOh\u2026 ok then, here, hold this,\u201d he thrust the jar of rosehip seeds into Sirius\u2019 hands, pulling back his robes.\nHe produced a very long, voluminous cloak, woven from the strangest looking fabric Remus had ever seen \u2013 silvery grey and shimmery.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sirius gaped, \u201cYou haven\u2019t, Potter, you bloody haven\u2019t\u2026\u201d\nJames was grinning so broadly now that Remus thought his face might split in two. The gangly boy winked at them all, then, with a flourish, swept the cloak over his head, so that it covered him top to toe. He vanished.\n\u201cYou jammy bastard!\u201d Sirius whooped, \u201cHow come you never told me?!\u201d\n\u201cYou never told me, either!\u201d Peter squeaked, \u201cAnd I\u2019ve known you forever. Where did you get it?\u201d\nJames pulled the hood of the cloak down, so that his head appeared to float in mid-air. It made Remus feel a bit queasy.\n\u201cBeen in the family for years.\u201d He said, triumphantly, \u201cDad let me bring it, as long as I don\u2019t tell mum.\u201d\n\u201cLucky git.\u201d Sirius said, grabbing for some of the invisible material and rubbing it between his fingers, \u201cMy parents would do\nanything\nfor an invisibility cloak.\u201d\n\u201cI reckon we can all fit under it,\u201d James demonstrated, pulling it apart and raising his arms like a bat, \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s all get nice and cosy\u2026\u201d\nThey all shuffled underneath the cloak, then tried waddling up and down the room a few times until they were able to walk comfortably together. Finally, trying not to giggle or whisper too much, the four invisible boys made their way to the dungeons. Remus showed them which tiles to tap in order for the floor to open up in the third stall from the left.\n\u201cHow\u2019d you find this, Remus?\u201d James whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s genius.\u201d\n\u201cYou come out behind one of them rugs they hang on the walls, in the dungeons,\u201d Remus replied, \u201cI just looked behind it.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean a tapestry?\u201d Peter asked,\n\u201cUm\u2026 s\u2019pose so?\u201d Remus was glad none of them could see his face.\n\u201cShut up, Pettigrew.\u201d Sirius snapped. Remus felt a sharp kick hit the back of his ankle,\n\u201cOi,\u201d he hissed, kicking back twice as hard \u201cBugger off.\u201d\n\u201cSorry!\u201d Sirius yelped, \u201cMeant to get Pete, not you.\u201d\n\u201cBe quiet, all of you,\u201d James snapped, \u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d\nThey waited quietly on their side of the tapestry, listening for footsteps in the corridor outside. Once James was satisfied that it was quiet, they all clambered out of the passage. The dungeons were cool, dimly lit and cavernous. There was a strange dripping sound coming from somewhere \u2013 perhaps the pipes.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the entrance?\u201d Sirius murmured.\n\u201cBehind that wall,\u201d Remus pointed, hoping they could see where he was aiming. It was a plain brick wall.\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen them go in before,\u201d Remus said, hurriedly. He wasn\u2019t going to tell them that he knew there were two hundred Slytherins on the other side because the scent of their blood and their magic so strongly he could almost taste it.\n\u201cD\u2019you know the password?\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\u201cDamn.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not curfew yet, let\u2019s just wait.\u201d\nSo they did, rather uncomfortably. Though the corridor was dank, it was unnecessarily warm underneath the cloak, especially with all four of them so close together. Fortunately, two seventh years came hurrying through in the next few minutes. Unfortunately, Sirius knew them.\n\u201cLet\u2019s see the ring again, Bella!\u201d Narcissa Black pleaded with her elder sister. Remus felt Sirius stiffen, pressing himself backwards into the wall.\nBellatrix preened, extending a long, ivory arm. On her bony finger was an enormous, ugly silver and emerald engagement ring, which she\u2019d been flashing about since the start of term. Everyone in the school knew that she would be marrying Rodolphus Lestrange, some wizard politician, as soon as she completed her NEWTs. Sirius had to go to the wedding.\nNarcissa squealed when she saw it, though she\u2019d probably seen it more than anyone else.\n\u201cGorgeous!\u201d She gushed, \u201cOh, I can\u2019t wait to get married\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWait your turn,\u201d Bellatrix replied, with a voice like nails on a chalkboard. \u201cOnce Lucius has a better position with the ministry I\u2019m sure Mummy and Daddy will agree to the match.\u201d\nThe two young women were standing before the brick wall now. Bellatrix was the taller of the two, but they looked very alike. They had long, black curly hair \u2013 much like Sirius himself, and that same perfect Black family bone structure.\n\u201c\nMundus sanguine\n,\u201d Bellatrix announced. The wall slid aside to let them in, and the four boys hurried after, as fast as possible before it closed.\nFor the first time since he had been at Hogwarts, Remus was truly glad he had been placed in Gryffindor. The differences between their warm, comfortable common room and that of the Slytherin\u2019s was stark. It was built like an enormous banquet hall, rather than a sitting room. The walls were richly decorated with yet more elegant tapestries, the fireplace was huge and ornately carved, and a ghoulish green pallor hung over everything. More than that, the place\nfelt\nsomehow wicked. Remus tried not to shudder.\nThe other boys seemed as uneasy as he was, and they all froze still until James prodded them forward, up a flight of stairs which they all hoped led to the boy\u2019s dormitories. On their way they passed Severus, sitting alone in a corner, hunched over his potions textbook. At the top of the stairs, they entered the first open door which was, thankfully, a bedroom.\nJames threw off the cloak,\n\u201cKeep a look out, eh Petey?\u201d He said, hurrying into the room, \u201cReckon one of these is Snape\u2019s bed?\u201d\n\u201cThis one might be,\u201d Sirius pointed, \u201cSheets look greasy enough.\u201d All four boys snickered.\n\u201cQuick then, lads, gloves on,\u201d James whispered, unscrewing the jar. Remus and Sirius pulled on a dragon hide glove each, grabbed a handful of seeds and began scattering them underneath the bedclothes.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll see them!\u201d James said, sounding disappointed. It was true, the bright red little seeds stood out clearly against the white sheets, even in the dark.\n\u201cWell\u2026 they\u2019ll still get it on them trying to brush them out,\u201d Sirius offered.\n\u201cHang on\u2026\u201d Remus had a sudden idea. He didn\u2019t know how it had occurred to him, or why, but somehow he was just sure it would work. He pulled out his wand, bit his lip and waved it gingerly over the bed he had just scattered with seeds. \u201c\nObfuscate\n.\u201d He whispered.\nAnd just like that, the seeds were gone. Well, he knew they were still there; but no one would be able to see them now.\n\u201cBlimey!\u201d James stared, \u201cHow\u2019d you do that? Flitwick hasn\u2019t taught us that charm yet, has he? Was it in the reading?\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d Remus shrugged, \u201cI saw some of the fifth years doing it yesterday to some sweets they bought in the village. S\u2019not hard to copy.\u201d\nSirius and James immediately attempted it themselves, over the seeds they had just scattered. It didn\u2019t work the first time \u2013 or the second, but after the third, James had managed to vanish most of his.\n\u201cYou\u2019d better do it, Lupin, or we\u2019ll be here all night.\u201d He decided.\n\u201cYes, please hurry up!\u201d Peter hissed from the doorway, white with fear.\nSirius tried a few more times before giving up and letting Remus take over.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to show me exactly how to do that as soon as we\u2019re back on neutral territory.\u201d He said. Remus nodded, though he wasn\u2019t sure how to explain it. He really had just done it because he thought he probably could.\n\u201cNext room,\u201d James announced, pulling them back to the entranceway.\n\u201cDo we have to?\u201d Peter asked, hopping from foot to foot, \u201cIsn\u2019t that enough?\u201d\n\u201cNot even close!\u201d Sirius replied with a laugh, tossing his head, \u201cWhat if we haven\u2019t even got Snape\u2019s bed yet? We have to get them\nall\n, Pete. Are you with us or not?\u201d\n\u201cAll the boys, anyway,\u201d James said, as they entered the next bedroom, \u201cI don\u2019t fancy our chances getting into the girl\u2019s \u2013 remember what happened to Dirk Creswell last week?\u201d\nThey worked quickly and managed to get every single boys room. Even the last one, which had three sleeping students in it \u2013 sixth years. Even Sirius had begged off going in there, but Remus was giddy with the excitement of the prank now, and threw on the invisibility cloak to go in himself. He even scattered the rosehips over the pillows of the sleeping boys.\nBy the time they had finished, it was getting late and more and more Slytherin\u2019s were heading upstairs for bed. Barely able to contain their glee, the four Gryffindor\u2019s hid under the cloak and slowly crept back down the stairs, flattening themselves against the wall anytime someone was coming, then through the enormous stately common room and out through the wall they\u2019d come in.\nAs James had instructed, they all kept as quiet as possible until they were within spitting distance of Gryffindor tower, and it was finally safe to remove the cloak once more.\n\u201cWiddershins!\u201d They all chanted at the fat lady, who swung open for them.\nIt was bliss to be back in the warm, bright Gryffindor common room, and they all threw themselves into the nearest available sofa, grinning inanely at each other. Frank Longbottom called to them from his desk, where he was tidying up revision notes,\n\u201cCutting it fine, lads, been somewhere interesting?\u201d\nPeter looked uncertain, but James just waved a hand,\n\u201cLibrary, obviously.\u201d\nFrank shook his head, though he was smiling,\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll hear about it soon enough.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I could be there when it all kicks off!\u201d Sirius whispered, his eyes shining with joy, \u201cAnd I wish even more we could have got my cousins.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the beginning, Sirius mate,\u201d James replied, slapping the other boy\u2019s knee, \u201cBetween the four of us I reckon we could go even\nbigger\nnext time. Excellent first mission, men!\u201d\nPeter whimpered,\n\u201c\nFirst\nmission?!\u201d"

            "content": "Wednesday 15\nth\nSeptember 1971\nThe next morning James and Sirius could barely contain their excitement and hurried their dorm mates down to breakfast before any of the other Gryffindors. They were the first students to reach the great hall, other than a few Ravenclaws bent over their NEWT revision books with huge mugs of black coffee.\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d Sirius beamed at the empty benches, \u201cFront row seats!\u201d\n\u201cBet no one shows up for hours.\u201d Peter groaned, half asleep, propped up on his elbows.\n\u201cOh cheer up,\u201d James poured them all large mugs of tea, \u201cDon\u2019t want to see the fruits of our labour?\u201d\n\u201cNot at six in the morning.\u201d Peter replied, slurping his tea. Sirius winced at the sound and pushed a plate towards him,\n\u201cHave some toast and stop whinging.\u201d\nRemus took some toast too and cut it into four pieces. He spread marmalade onto one quarter, jam onto another, butter on the third and lemon curd on the last. He ignored the look of amusement Sirius was giving him. Remus had never had so much choice before, and was determined to make the most of every meal.\nFortunately, they did not have to wait too long before the other students began to trickle in for breakfast. The first Slytherins arrived just as Remus was finishing his toast. Three boys and two girls; third years. They walked over to their table, quite unaware of the four eager Gryffindors watching them intently. For a few moments it was as if nothing was different. Sirius sighed with disappointment. But then. The tallest boy shuffled slightly in his seat, rubbing his arm. Another seemed to be looking for something in his pocket, but from Remus\u2019 viewpoint he was clearly scratching his leg furiously. The third kept using his wand to rub behind his ear.\n\u201cIt worked!\u201d James whispered, breathless with excitement. Even Peter looked cheerful now.\nAs more and more Slytherins filtered in, their problem became more obvious \u2013 and more hilarious. By seven o\u2019clock the Slytherin table was full of squirming, writhing, scratching boys, and horrified looking girls. Amycus Carrow, a burley sixth year, eventually ripped off his robes, his school jumper and even his tie to claw at his chest which Remus could see was already red raw. He almost felt sorry for them.\nBut then Snape came in. Whether it was karma or sheer luck, Severus seemed to have reacted particularly badly to the rosehip seeds. He walked in with his head bowed, hair falling over his face, but his nose was still visible and clearly bright red.\n\u201cOh Merlin!\u201d Sirius wheezed, laughing so hard he was holding his stomach. \u201cTell me we got his face!\u201d\n\u201cOi, Snivellus!\u201d James yelled out, suddenly, to get the other boy\u2019s attention.\nSnape spun around, looking up; his hair parted. The left side of his face was covered in an angry red rash, from his temples all the way down to his neck, disappearing under his uniform. His left eye was red too, the lid swollen and irritated.\n\u201cLooking good!\u201d Sirius crowed, and all four boys dissolved into giggles as Snape stormed out of the room.\nBy the time breakfast was over, the entire castle was buzzing with rumours about what exactly had come over the Slytherin boys. Sirius and James looked as though all of their Christmases had come at once, and even Peter had cheered up remarkably \u2013 reminding them all that\nhe\nhad kept lookout, after all, making the entire venture possible.\n\u201cIt was all Lupin\u2019s idea, though,\u201d Sirius returned, slapping Remus heartily on the back, \u201cWhat shall we do to celebrate, eh? Exploding snap? Raid the kitchens?\u201d\nRemus shook Sirius off, smiling politely.\n\u201cWell, whatever you do, you\u2019re doing it without me,\u201d he replied, \u201cI\u2019ve got double detention.\u201d\n\u201cFrom Slughorn?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and McGonagall. And Flitwick, but that\u2019s tomorrow. Then my Herbology detention is over the weekend.\u201d\n\u201cBloody hell mate,\u201d James frowned, \u201cYou going for a record or something?\u201d\nRemus shrugged. He was always being punished at St. Edmund\u2019s \u2013 all the boys were. Detention didn\u2019t bother him. Though exploding snap did sound like a lot of fun.\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019d better start doing your homework?\u201d Sirius said, gently. Remus rolled his eyes, getting up from the table.\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s Defence Against the Dark Arts first, thought you two loved that.\u201d\n* * *\nLater that day, Remus was on his way to his detention with Slughorn, when he ran into Lily Evans. He was perfectly happy to keep walking, but she smiled and fell into step with him.\n\u201cHiya Remus,\u201d\n\u201cHi.\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to the dungeons?\u201d\nHe nodded.\n\u201cMe too. I have to tell Slughorn that Severus can\u2019t make his detention.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right.\u201d\n\u201cDid you hear what happened to the Slytherins?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Everyone had heard \u2013 it was all they\u2019d been talking about all day, even during lessons. Fortunately no one had a clue yet who\u2019d done it. It had been a good idea, attacking the entire house at once. Who could guess who the target had been?\n\u201cCrazy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Lily continued, \u201cPoor Sev was allergic to whatever they used. Madam Pompfrey gave him a sleeping draught while the swelling goes down.\u201d\nRemus sniggered, without thinking. He glanced at Lily, who was looking back at him with reproachful green eyes. She shook her head.\n\u201cLook, I know he wasn\u2019t very nice to you. The other day in Potions\nor\non the train. He\u2019s\u2026 well he\u2019s a bit of a snob, ok?\u201d\nRemus snorted.\n\u201cBut I wanted to say sorry.\u201d Lily pressed on, \u201cI need to stand up to him more. Shouldn\u2019t let him get away with it. He\u2019s actually a really nice person when you get to know him.\u201d\n\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Remus stopped walking. They were outside Slughorn\u2019s office now. The door was closed, and there were raised voices on the other side.\n\u201cHorace, whoever it was, they must have been a Slytherin!\u201d It was Professor McGonagall, \u201cWho else has the password?\u201d\n\u201cWhy would a Slytherin attack their own house, Minerva?!\u201d The Potions master sounded very frustrated.\n\u201cYou did say it was only the boys dorms affected. Perhaps it was one of the girls.\u201d\n\u201cReally!\u201d\n\u201cWell, who else? Peeves? He never enters the common rooms \u2013 doesn\u2019t enter the dungeons, either, come to that \u2013 too frightened of the bloody baron.\u201d\n\u201cWe ought to place a ban on all Zonko\u2019s products.\u201d\n\u201cFrom what Poppy says it\nwasn\u2019t\na Zonko\u2019s product. Rosehip, from the greenhouses.\u201d\nLupin felt as trickle of fear run down his spine. If they knew that much, would they be able to find out who\u2019d done it?\n\u201cRosehip eh? Very clever.\u201d Slughorn actually sounded impressed. McGonagall sighed,\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019d like to blame the Ravenclaws now?\u201d\n\u201cI just wish I knew who\u2019d done it!\u201d He sighed, heavily. \u201cPerhaps the truth will out. I suppose it does seem more likely that it was one of the Slytherin girls than\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThan a gang of marauders creeping into the dungeons under the cloak of night with malicious intent?\u201d\nRemus could hear Slughorn\u2019s chuckle at that.\n\u201cYes, quite.\u201d\n\u201cNow, I must be going.\u201d McGonagall was saying, her footsteps approaching the door. \u201cYou will let me know if you catch the culprit?\u201d The door swung open. Remus and Lily stepped back, guiltily. McGonagall looked down at them through her spectacles, \u201cWhat are two Gryffindors doing so far from their tower?\u201d\n\u201cPlease, Professor, Remus and I were only\u2014\u201c\n\u201cAh!\u201d Slughorn cut off Lily\u2019s nervous rambling, \u201cLupin, my boy \u2013 and Miss Evans! Come to offer Snape\u2019s apologies, eh? No need, dear girl, no need. With everything going on today I think we can cancel the boy\u2019s detentions, for now.\u201d He came to the door and looked down at Remus severely, \u201cIf it is understood that there will be no more fighting in my classes? Or any classes, for that matter, hm?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Professor.\u201d Remus nodded, solemnly, trying not to look too pleased.\n\u201cExcellent.\u201d Slughorn beamed, locking the door to his office, \u201cThen if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ve some enquiries to make.\u201d\nRemus and Lily had almost made it to the end of the hall when McGonagall suddenly called out,\n\u201cMr Lupin?\u201d\nRemus\u2019 heart sank.\n\u201cYes, Professor McGonagall?\u201d\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t to say that your detention with\nme\nhas been cancelled. Come along now, we\u2019ll get an early start.\u201d\n* * *\nMcGonagall had him doing lines for an hour \u2013 not too bad, considering he was used to canings at St Edmund\u2019s. He didn\u2019t mind copying and repetition; it was soothing.\nI will complete all assignments set.\nPerhaps he\u2019d swallow his pride next time and copy James\u2019 homework. Or Peter\u2019s, if he didn\u2019t want to look too suspicious. But he knew that James would eventually want to know\nwhy\nRemus never read the set text. And if he told him, then he was equally sure that James and Sirius would try to get him to explain to McGonagall \u2013 both boys had unerring faith in the teachers of Hogwarts. Remus, however, had never met an adult he trusted. She\u2019d have him sent back to St Edmund\u2019s at once. What good was an illiterate wizard to anyone?\nOnce his detention was finished, he climbed through the portrait hole and into the common room to find his three roommates waiting for him. Peter and James were engaged in a very serious looking game of chess (\nof course the pieces are moving.\nRemus thought to himself,\neverything has to bloody move in this castle.\n) while Sirius was listening to one of his records through a very posh looking set of brand new headphones. Remus was dying to have a listen, but he hadn\u2019t worked up the courage to ask yet.\nHe sat down next to Sirius quietly. The long haired boy pulled his headphones off at once,\n\u201cThat was quick!\u201d\n\u201cOnly had to do one in the end,\u201d Remus explained, \u201cSlughorn let me off, too busy trying to sort out the itching powder thing.\u201d\nSirius grinned broadly, leaning back on the couch with his arms folded under his head,\n\u201cThat prank is just the gift that keeps on giving.\u201d\n\u201cSnape was allergic and everything,\u201d Remus said, smirking, \u201cThat ginger girl said he\u2019s been in the hospital wing all day.\u201d\nSirius laughed even louder. His eyes grew bright when he laughed, Remus had never seen anyone exhibit such pure joy. It made you want to punch him and be his friend all at the same time.\n\u201cWhich ginger girl?\u201d James looked up suddenly,\n\u201cCheck MATE!\u201d Peter cried.\n\u201cYou know, the annoying one. Evans.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s annoying.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d Remus shrugged.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about girls.\u201d Sirius rolled his eyes, \u201cThis might be the most important day of our lives! This is the day we became legends; the day our friendship was forged in the fire of itching powder!\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know it was us, do they?\u201d Peter asked, nervously, tidying away his chess set. Remus shook his head.\n\u201cSlughorn reckons it was a Slytherin girl. Or a gang of marauders.\u201d\n\u201cMarauders!\u201d Sirius sat up, suddenly, \u201cThat\u2019s it! Raise your glasses, boys!\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have glasses.\u201d James replied, amused.\n\u201cWell, just pretend.\u201d Sirius shook his head, irritably, \u201cFrom this day forward, we are\nThe\n\nMarauders\n!\u201d\nHe said this with such a dramatic flourish that it could only be followed by stunned silence. James was grinning, Peter glancing at him for direction, not quite understanding what was going on. Remus burst out laughing.\n\u201cWhat sort of poncey gang name is that?!\u201d"

            "content": "Tuesday, 5\nth\nOctober 1971\nThe next full moon passed much as the first had. This time the wolf had clearly grown restless, because Remus awoke with a number of deep scratches.\n\u201cThey heal fast with a bit of antiseptic.\u201d He advised Madam Pomfrey, who fussed over him in the chill morning light.\n\u201cAnd faster still with magic,\u201d she smiled, with a flourish of her wand. The cuts closed up almost instantly, Remus stared, amazed.\n\u201cCan you get rid of the scars, too?\u201d He asked, eagerly. She shook her head sadly,\n\u201cNo, Remus, not these ones, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cS\u2019ok.\u201d He sighed, dressing for school. This time he\u2019d brought his change of clothes with him and left them in the tunnel just outside the shack to avoid having to go back to the tower this time. He\u2019d meet the other boys in their first lesson, and let them wonder where he\u2019d been.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go to school today,\u201d Madam Pomfrey was saying, \u201cNot if you\u2019re too tired. I can write you a note.\u201d\n\u201cI want to go.\u201d He replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad, honestly.\u201d\nPomfrey looked at him with serious eyes,\n\u201cNot that bad for now. I\u2019m afraid the transformations may start to take their toll as you grow up.\u201d\n\u201cHave you looked after other kids like me, then?\u201d He\u2019d been wanting to ask for ages, but wasn\u2019t sure how.\n\u201cNo, dear, you\u2019re the first Hogwarts student that I know of who\u2019s been\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBitten?\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s been bitten.\u201d She accepted, gratefully, \u201cBut I promise I know what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019ve done plenty of reading on the subject.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean there are books? About people like me?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes.\u201d She sounded surprised. She sat down on the bed as he finished dressing. \u201cYou could borrow one of them, if you like?\u201d\nHe thought about it, then shook his head.\n* * *\nThey had Transfiguration first thing, but McGonagall didn\u2019t give him detention for not bringing his homework \u2013 she had obviously decided to be more lenient around the full moon. She did make him promise to bring it with him next time, and he agreed, hoping he sounded sincere. James, Sirius and Peter spent half of the lesson trying to get his attention, but he steadfastly ignored them until McGonagall threatened to separate all four of them.\nIn the halls on their way to Charms, Remus knew there was no escape. It was a good five minute walk.\n\u201cSo? Where were you?!\u201d Sirius blurted out, walking on his left hand side.\n\u201cNowhere.\u201d He replied, trying to hurry on,\n\u201cOh, go on,\u201d James pleaded, coming up on his right side, \u201cTell us! Was it the same place you went last month?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\u201cWere you in detention again?\u201d Asked Peter, struggling to keep up. Remus cursed himself for not having thought of that \u2013 detention would have been the perfect cover.\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\u201cThen where\u2014\u201c\n\u201cWatch it, half-blood!\u201d\nRemus had been too busy evading questions to look where he was going, and had run smack into Snape, who was coming around the corner. Already wound up, Remus squared his shoulders and attempted to push past, roughly,\n\u201cWatch yourself,\nSnivellus\n.\u201d\nSnape didn\u2019t move, and pushed him instead, Mulciber appearing at his left shoulder, looming menacingly over the smaller boys.\n\u201cI know it was you that broke into our dorms the other night.\u201d He hissed, \u201c\nAll\nof you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Prove it.\u201d James smirked, folding his arms.\nSnape\u2019s lips curled,\n\u201cI can\u2019t, yet. But I will. I\u2019ll get you back too, I promise.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re\nquaking\nin our boots,\u201d Sirius replied, leaning against the wall as if he was bored. \u201cNow would you kindly move it?\u201d\n\u201cYour idea, was it, Black?\u201d Snape drawled, \u201cOr yours, Potter? Had to have been one of you. Pettigrew doesn\u2019t have the guts and dear Lupin here clearly hasn\u2019t got the brains\u2026\u201d\nRemus clenched his fists. He could see Snape\u2019s hand on his wand \u2013 Severus probably knew all sorts of curses and hexes. James had taught Remus one or two, but he was too blind with rage to remember any of them now.\n\u201cMove along now, gentlemen.\u201d A sharp voice suddenly rang out over the corridor. It was Professor Flitwick, stepping out of his classroom to see what the holdup was. \u201cSeverus, you\u2019re clogging up the halls, and you four are supposed to be in my class. Come along.\u201d\nRemus felt overheated and agitated for the rest of Charms, which was usually his favourite lesson. It relied more on practical work with his wand than reading or writing, and he often did better than even James and Sirius. Finding it difficult to calm down, he kept shooting his cushions across the room like missiles rather than guiding them carefully through the hoops Flitwick had hung from the ceiling.\nThey\u2019d been working on levitation charms for a few weeks now, and Peter was the only one still struggling. In Remus\u2019 opinion, Peter\u2019s problem was a lack of imagination. James and Sirius were both unerringly confident; and he\u2019d found that confidence was all you needed to complete most basic spells. Remus himself generally felt able to complete any task if it looked simple enough. Peter, on the other hand,\nworried\nabout everything. He read and re-read his textbooks, trying to copy the complicated diagrams there rather than just copy what Flitwick showed them.\n\u201cI expect you all to be able to levitate this book by the end of the week,\u201d Flitwick said at the end of the lesson. The book was enormous, about half the size of the tiny professor, and looked as though a fully-grown man might have trouble carrying it very far. \u201cSo come prepared for a quick test of your abilities.\u201d\nPeter groaned as they collected their things to leave.\nRemus had managed to calm down by lunch time, but still had trouble controlling his magic later in the afternoon and was glad they only had Herbology and History of Magic. He wondered whether it was his temper \u2013 which had always been short \u2013 or whether it was the full moon. He always had a lot of energy after a transformation, even before he knew he could do magic. Now his wand buzzed in his hand like the static in a TV aerial. He tried a quick \u2018\nLumos\u2019\n, hiding in a toilet cubicle between lessons, and nearly burnt his retinas out.\nPerhaps the book Madam Pomfrey had mentioned might tell him more about it, but he\u2019d never know now. There might be other books in the library, but he hadn\u2019t checked. He knew the word, well enough, and could spell it out if he concentrated hard. But he didn\u2019t dare. Remus lived in fear that if he wrote it down, or said it out loud, then somehow everyone would find out his secret. And it was just better to keep stuff like that in your head.\n* * *\nThursday 7\nth\nOctober 1971\nIt was especially important to keep his secrets to himself now, because Remus was being watched. By McGonagall, who still raised an eyebrow when she saw he wasn\u2019t taking notes, by Madam Pomfrey, who was always trying to get to him stop by the hospital wing for a quick check over, and by Snape, who was still furious that he couldn\u2019t figure out how the itching powder incident had happened. Remus might have been able to bear all of these interferences, if it wasn\u2019t for a fourth person observing him.\nThis stalker was much subtler, much less direct in his surveillance, but noticeable nonetheless. Sirius. At first Remus had thought the other boy was just nosy \u2013 part of that entitlement he and James shared. They had to know everything about everybody. They were constantly telling Remus and Peter other people\u2019s business \u2013 so-and-so\u2019s father was turned down for a promotion at the ministry years ago, and that\u2019s why they have that chip on their shoulder; Miranda Thrup\u2019s great-aunt was once under investigation for the illegal use of a love potion, and now no one ever drank tea at the Thrup\u2019s house; Professor Slughorn knew more about the dark arts than he let on, and the Slug Club was notorious for turning out dark wizards with influence.\nOf course, neither of them knew anything at all about Remus, and in the beginning, he assumed that this was why Sirius was so watchful. But he never asked any direct questions, and if he was curious about Lupin\u2019s family or upbringing then it was a private interest that James did not share. James rarely watched other people, Remus had noticed \u2013 he preferred other people to be watching him.\nNo one else seemed to notice, thankfully. Sirius was sly in that respect. Only very occasionally, Remus managed to catch him unawares, staring intently with those deep blue eyes. He didn\u2019t even have the shame to look away when he was caught \u2013 only softened his gaze into a friendly smile, which Remus was obliged to return.\nThat Thursday they were finishing their homework in Gryffindor common room \u2013 well, James was finishing Remus\u2019 homework, having completed his own. He\u2019d offered to do it in return for Remus teaching him the \u2018\nObfuscate\u2019\nspell, and despite his pride Remus had acquiesced. He really didn\u2019t want another detention with McGonagall, and James was good at imitating other peoples\u2019 handwriting.\nSirius was completing his own essay, and had already written three inches extra on the uses of lacewing flies in transformative draughts \u2013 plus diagrams. There were books strewn all over the table they\u2019d claimed for themselves, along with inkwells and scrunched up rolls of parchment. Peter was trying to levitate an apple and get it into a waste paper basket four feet away. So far he could get it up in the air, but then it wobbled and fell back down again.\nFrazzled, Peter ran his fingers through his hair again and consulted his text.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get it, Pete, don\u2019t worry.\u201d James murmured, not looking up from Remus\u2019 paper. \u201cKeep at it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m\ntrying\n,\u201d Peter whined, \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s the movement I\u2019m getting wrong\u2026 the book says to use a \u2018smooth, serpentine action\u2019, but I\u2019m not sure\u2026\u201d he swirled his wand in the air. Remus tutted,\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d He said, bluntly. \u201cIt\u2019s like an S shape on its side. Look.\u201d He performed the spell, effortlessly lifting the apple into the air and sending it sailing into the bin neatly.\n\u201cAn S shape, are you sure?\u201d Peter frowned. He aimed his own wand at a scrunched-up ball of paper from the table, \u201c\nWingardium\n\nLeviosa\n!\u201d He chanted, waving his wand in the same way Lupin had. Sure enough, the paper flew shakily upwards then flew with slightly less grace into the bin, bouncing off the sides as it fell to the bottom and landed beside the apple. Peter stared wide-eyed, \u201cI did it!\u201d He gasped, \u201cAn \u2018S\u2019 shape, why didn\u2019t it just say that in the book?!\u201d\n\u201cWell done, Pete.\u201d James said, looking up and smiling. He took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes, \u201cYou should be a teacher, Remus.\u201d\nLupin snorted, looking away bashfully. James continued,\n\u201cI\u2019m nearly done with this, just need to check something \u2013 can you pass me\nMagical\n\nTheory\n? The Waffling book?\u201d\nRemus felt a cold shiver run down his spine. Trying not to panic, he looked down at the pile of books James was pointing at. One of them was definitely about potions \u2013 it had a cauldron on the cover. The others; it was anyone\u2019s guess. The gold and silver lettering on each cover seemed to shift and swirl before his eyes. Was it better to just pick one up, even if it was the wrong one? He looked back at James, desperately, who was reading over what he\u2019d written. Peter was too busy levitating more balls of paper to notice Remus\u2019 turmoil. He looked down again, biting his lip.\nSirius cleared his throat quietly and leaned across the desk. He silently tapped one of the books with his forefinger, without looking at Remus. It was a big black leather-bound tome which Remus recognised vaguely. Gratefully, he snatched it up and handed it to James.\n\u201cCheers mate.\u201d James said, absentmindedly, returning to his work. Sirius carried on as if nothing had happened. Remus felt his cheeks burning."

            "content": "Friday 15\nth\nOctober 1971\nRemus had to spend the next few days avoiding Sirius \u2013 or at least avoiding being alone with him. This wasn\u2019t easy, the boys spent all their time together, especially on the weekends. They all got through the Friday Charms lesson with no trouble; even Peter. Flitwick was thrilled that the entire class had mastered levitation so early in the year that he let them all out early for lunch.\nSirius made himself unavoidable the very next week, during their flying lesson. \u00a0If Remus hadn\u2019t hated History of Magic so much, then Flying would have been his least favourite subject. Twenty minutes into their very first lesson with Madam Hooch he had learnt that he was afraid of heights, and the rest of the classes had been miserable for him.\nJames was the star of the class, of course, and even the other Marauders found him insufferable as he flitted around the quidditch pitch, throwing loops and feints as if he was born on a broom. Sirius was excellent too, and most of the other kids in the class had grown up playing on broomsticks; even Peter was competent.\nIt had rained the night before, and the ground was soft and muddy. They\u2019d changed out of their usual lace up shoes and into thick boots and scarlet flying kits before squelching out onto the pitch. They picked up their brooms and awaited instruction. The brooms were provided by the school. First years weren\u2019t allowed to bring their own, but James would tell anyone who stopped long enough to listen that he had a top of the line model at home.\n\u201cRight, mount your brooms please, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d Hooch bellowed at the group, \u201cNice strong wind today, so I want you all to take good care. Potter, no showing off!\u201d\nRemus clambered onto his broom, swallowing hard. If he could manage not to be sick then it would be a victory.\n\u201cI\u2019d like five clean laps around the pitch, then a good landing back here from each of you. Mind the puddle and remember to lean into the wind where possible. Use it to your advantage. Five points to whoever\u2019s back first.\u201d And with barely any warning, the silver haired witch blew her whistle hard.\nRemus and Lily, the only two muggleborns in the class, were the last off the ground. Once the redhead was in the air, however, she streaked ahead with ease.\n\u201cBit higher, Lupin! Come on now!\u201d Hooch boomed from below, shouting through a megaphone. He wanted to ignore her, but there was no escape \u2013 at least back at St Edmund\u2019s when they made you do cross country you could hide around the corner and skive off in town for the afternoon.\nHe pushed himself higher, trying to look ahead and not down; trying to think about anything other than the empty space between himself and the ground. He could see Lily\u2019s bright red plait flashing ahead like a fox\u2019s tail, Peter\u2019s shining blond hair somewhere towards the middle of the group. Though he couldn\u2019t see that far ahead, he knew that James and Sirius were almost neck and neck. Remus just ploughed on grimly, not wanting to go any faster. Who cared if he was last, if he didn\u2019t break his neck getting there. As he rounded a corner at the end of the pitch, the wind really hit him and he tried not to slow down too much, leaning forward. It was so cold, and the grey morning air battered his face.\nThe second lap was as bad as the first. By the third, he noticed that James had taken to circling each of the towers in the empty spectator stands, despite Madam Hooch\u2019s admonishments. On the fourth lap, Remus had company.\n\u201cHaving fun?\u201d Sirius grinned, cruising along beside him. He looked so comfortable, as if he could raise both hands over his head, spin upside down and fly backwards without any trouble at all.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Remus frowned, trying to ignore him. \u201cTrying to lose?\u201d\n\u201cJames is gonna win,\u201d Sirius shrugged, \u201cMight as well let him have his moment. Thought I\u2019d hang out with you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?!\u201d Remus replied, through gritted teeth.\n\u201cThought you might want the company,\u201d Remus didn\u2019t need to look at him to know that he was grinning that irritating Sirius Black grin. \u201cPlus we\u2019re about to land, and I know you hate landing.\u201d\n\u201cPiss off.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you, Black\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t punch me up here, Lupin, unless you want to let go of your broom.\u201d\n\u201cGod, you\u2019re annoying.\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d Sirius flew up in front of him, then all the way around, a perfect orbit.\n\u201cPiss\noff\n.\u201d Remus tried to dodge him, wobbling dangerously.\n\u201cTime to land... remember to stick your legs out and lean back\u2026 then bend your knees as you hit the\u2014oi!\u201d\nRemus had grabbed the tail of Sirius\u2019 broom and given it a hard yank. Laughing, Sirius righted himself, then flew back to Remus\u2019 side and gave him a hard shove back. Remus shook, but held on tight, making his descent. It was much smoother than before, he leaned back, then twisted quickly to push Sirius again.\n\u201cOut of my way!\u201d He yelled, going faster, \u201cYou can be the last down for once!\u201d\n\u201cOh no you don\u2019t!\u201d Sirius now grabbed Remus\u2019 broom tail, laughing, tugging him backwards. This was perhaps a step too far, as they were both quite close to the ground now. The two wrestling boys tumbled towards earth, brooms flying out from beneath them they both crash landed into a huge muddy puddle, skidding and rolling forwards, soaking their robes in the process.\n\u201cBlack! Lupin!\u201d Madam Hooch marched over to the two boys sprawled in the mud.\nThe other Gryffindors gathered around, giggling and pointing. Sirius leapt to his feet with all of the grace his nobility blessed him with, and pulled Lupin up roughly by the hand. They both looked up at the teacher, blinking water droplets from their eyes.\n\u201cWhat did I say about minding the puddle?\u201d Madam Hooch raised an amused eyebrow. She usually saw the fun in things. \u201cA point each from Gryffindor. You\u2019d better go and wash off in the showers. Off you go.\u201d\nThey both waddled towards the quidditch changing rooms, holding out their heavy, waterlogged robes.\n\u201cBloody ridiculous kit.\u201d Remus grumbled as they stepped into the squat littler stone building. \u201cHow we ever going to dry it?\u201d\n\u201cThe house elves will take care of that.\u201d Sirius replied, shaking his off and dumping it in a pile in the corner.\nRemus couldn\u2019t be bothered to ask what on earth house elves were. He pulled his own robes off and kicked away his boots, then entered a shower cubical to continue undressing. There were towels laid out already, and the water was deliciously warm. He leaned forward into the stream, letting it warm his blood, watching the mud and rogue blades of grass swirl down the drain. At least he\u2019d got out of forty more minutes flying.\nHe scrubbed his hands roughly over his hair. Without Matron\u2019s monthly haircuts his hair was getting longer and softer, sticking straight up most of the time, as messy as James\u2019. He could finally see the colour of it, but was disappointed \u2013 it appeared to be a bland mousy brown.\nRemus finished in the shower before Sirius and got out, looking around for his uniform quickly. He was half dressed once Sirius finally emerged, his long hair swept back, wet and shining like oil. He was already fully dressed and looked impossibly cool and grown up, while Remus had realised he\u2019d missed a button on his shirt and had to begin all over again.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\nthat\n?!\u201d Sirius said, suddenly. Remus looked up, then back down. Sirius was pointing at a long silver stripe which stretched from the left half of his collar bone down diagonally across his chest to his right nipple. He fumbled with his buttons, trying to close the shirt faster.\n\u201cA scar.\u201d He muttered. There was no point saying anything else now. He barely noticed them anymore. They were just there, as much a part of him as his freckles, or the fine hairs on his arms.\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 did it happen to you at the home? Where you grew up?\u201d\nThere was something odd in Sirius\u2019 voice. Remus found he couldn\u2019t speak, so he just nodded. Sirius nodded too. \u201cI\u2019ve got scars.\u201d He said, so quietly that Remus thought he\u2019d misheard at first.\nSirius bent down, and pulled up his trouser leg, turning his ankle to show Remus the marks there. His scars weren\u2019t like Remus\u2019 \u2013 which were big and rough and jagged, full of rage and hunger. The silver stripes on the backs of Sirius\u2019 legs were thin and straight; uniform in their cruelty. Remus stared for a few seconds, before Sirius dropped the edge of the fabric and straightened up.\nThey stared each other down for a full minute. Remus feeling very hot, Sirius\u2019 eyes cool and calm. Then it broke.\n\u201cShall we go and watch James making a prat of himself?\u201d Sirius asked.\nRemus nodded again, and they both stepped back out into the cold autumn air. They took their seats on the hard benches in the spectator\u2019s stands and watched the rest of the class flitting back and forth across the pitch, red robes fluttering behind them. Lily, though lacking James\u2019 formal technique, was giving him a run for his money when it came to speed, beating him in two out of three races between goal posts.\n\u201cRemus?\u201d Sirius said, suddenly, as their classmates came in for their final landing.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t read, can you?\u201d\nRemus sighed. He had enough secrets to keep as it was. And Sirius had shared one of his.\n\u201cNah.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\n\u201cCheers.\u201d\nThat Sirius Black grin."

            "content": "Saturday 23\nrd\nOctober 1971\n\u201cDid you just never get taught?\u201d\nRemus shrugged, tired and frustrated. It was a week after the flying lesson, and Sirius had caught him on his own again. He\u2019d been sitting quite happily on his bed, flicking through one of James\u2019 quidditch magazines \u2013 he liked the moving pictures, even if he still didn\u2019t understand the rules, and it was the closest thing to telly they had at Hogwarts.\n\u201cI got taught.\u201d He replied, turning the page, hoping Sirius would take the hint and get lost. He didn\u2019t. Remus closed the magazine. \u201cI got taught.\u201d He repeated. \u201cJust didn\u2019t learn properly. When I look at the words, I don\u2019t think I see what everyone else does. It doesn\u2019t make any sense; all the letters keep jumping around and changing. Teachers said I was just thick.\u201d\nNo one had made much of a fuss about his problems with schoolwork at St Edmund\u2019s. They\u2019d barely had any homework, since no one did it anyway. Lots of the boys had problems; either they couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t be taught. It wasn\u2019t as if anyone expected much either way.\n\u201cBut how have you been\ndoing\nit?\u201d Sirius was like a dog with a bone.\n\u201cDoing\nwhat\n?!\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026 everything! All your work, here, at Hogwarts.\u201d\nRemus looked at him as if he was the one who was stupid,\n\u201cSirius, I\nhaven\u2019t\nbeen doing it. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m in detention every night.\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah, obviously,\u201d Sirius waved a hand, \u201cBut the other day, in Potions, I saw you \u2013 you didn\u2019t take any notes, didn\u2019t even look at the book,\nor\nthe blackboard, and you still prepared all of the ingredients for the cure for boils perfectly \u2013 Slughorn gave you five points!\u201d\nRemus felt himself blush at the memory. He wasn\u2019t used to getting praise from teachers.\n\u201cOh, that was easy,\u201d He shook his head, \u201cSluggy told us how to do it in the lesson before, I just remembered it.\u201d\n\u201cBloody hell, you must have a brilliant memory, then.\u201d\nRemus shrugged. He supposed that was true. His teachers at St Edmund\u2019s had remarked more than once that he knew an awful lot of words for somebody so dim witted.\nSirius was staring into space now, clearly deep in thought \u2013 Remus could practically see the cogs working in his mind. Sometimes Sirius was an entirely closed book. Other times he was so easy to read it was almost funny.\n\u201cIf you could read, you\u2019d be as good as me and James. Better, probably.\u201d\nRemus snorted,\n\u201cSo modest, Black.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you would!\u201d Sirius missed the sarcasm completely, still looking thoughtful, \u201cYour wandwork is much more natural, and if your memory is as good as you say it is\u2026\u201d He chewed his lip, \u201cI bet there\u2019s a spell for it.\u201d\nRemus laughed,\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to cure me with a spell?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\nRemus had thought about it already; of course he had. But he was more aware of the limitations of magic than anyone. After all, he had scars which would not heal and a monthly nightmare which nobody could prevent.\n\u201cMagic can\u2019t fix stuff like that.\u201d He replied bluntly. \u201cWhy else does James wear glasses?\u201d\n\u201cI think there\nare\nspells for eyesight.\u201d Sirius said, \u201cMaybe they\u2019re just not worth the effort, or too dangerous, or complicated or something.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the reading,\u201d Remus countered, \u201cMy writing\u2019s crap too; I\u2019m too slow, and it comes out all messy.\u201d\n\u201cThere are\ndefinitely\nspells for that.\u201d Sirius said, confidently, \u201cYou can bewitch your quill, I\u2019ve seen my father do it on official documents. His handwriting\u2019s really scratchy, normally.\u201d\nRemus was at a loss. Sirius clearly wasn\u2019t going to give up. He chewed his lip.\n\u201cWhy are you so interested, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re my fellow Marauder! We can\u2019t have you in detention every day, what if the Slytherins strike back? We\u2019ll need your evil mind for pranks.\u201d His eyes glittered. \u201cSpeaking of, I\u2019m assuming you haven\u2019t done your history homework yet?\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\u201cOk then, let\u2019s get started.\u201d Sirius jumped off the bed and began rooting around in his trunk.\n\u201cNo. You\u2019re not doing my homework for me.\u201d Remus protested, standing up himself, folding his arms.\n\u201cToo bloody right, I\u2019m not,\u201d Sirius replied, withdrawing a heavy book. It was\nA History of Magic\n; Remus recognised the size and shape. \u201cI just fancied refreshing my memory, that\u2019s all. So, I\u2019m going to sit here and read it aloud \u2013 because that helps me study \u2013 and if\nyou\nhappened to retain some of it in that enormous brain of yours, then there\u2019s not much I can do about it.\u201d\nRemus huffed,\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you go something better to do? Where\u2019s James, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cWatching the Gryffindor quidditch practice,\u201d Sirius settled down on his bed, opening the book. \u201cReckons he\u2019ll get on the team next year, so he\u2019s trying to pick up some tips. Peter\u2019s followed him, obviously. Now, be quiet please, I\u2019m trying to work.\u201d He cleared his throat, \u201c\nA history of magic, by Bathilda Bagshot. Chapter one, Ancient Egypt; the rights and rituals of Imhotep\u2026\n\u201d\nAnd on he went. And on, and on. Remus stayed standing for a while, trying to decide whether or not to just walk out of the room and slam the door. But he found that he really wasn\u2019t that angry \u2013 it was difficult to stay angry with Sirius, no matter how annoying he was. So Remus sat down, and listened. It turned out that history wasn\u2019t that boring after all, not when you understood the basics. Plus Sirius was considerably more animated than Professor Binns.\nHis voice was clear and steady, never stumbling over the more complicated words or phrases, as if he had read the book a hundred times. Remus had once heard him tell James that he was fluent in Latin and Greek \u2013 the Black family apparently took pride in that sort of thing.\nOn he ploughed, chapter after chapter, from the gory Egyptian resurrection charms to cryptic Greek oracles, to magical Mesopotamian priestesses. The ancient world opened up in Remus\u2019 mind, and he found himself lying back on his bed, arms behind his head with his eyes closed, letting Sirius lead him through time.\nEventually, the other boy\u2019s voice was almost hoarse, and he spoke just above a whisper. Evening had closed around them, and the common room was bathed in a golden orange glow as the sun set. Halfway through \u2018\nchapter five; Tiberius and the advancements of Roman battle magic\n,\u2019 Sirius let out a quiet cough, and put down the book.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can study any more today,\u201d he croaked.\nRemus\u2019 eyes snapped open. He sat up, blinking.\n\u201cThat\u2019s ok,\u201d He said, quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s dinner now, I\u2019m starving.\u201d\nThey both got up, stretched, and headed downstairs.\nJames and Peter were waiting for them at the Gryffindor table in their usual seats.\n\u201cHow was practice?\u201d Sirius asked, after draining a goblet of pumpkin juice. His voice had almost returned to normal, only sounding slightly strained.\n\u201cCracking.\u201d James replied cheerfully, spearing a sausage on the end of his fork and using it to scoop up some mashed potato, \u201cHow come you didn\u2019t come?\u201d\n\u201cHomework.\u201d Sirius replied, pouring gravy over his own mash.\nAs they finished their dinner, James regaled them with a blow by blow account of the quidditch practice, listing every player on the team, their strengths and faults, their techniques and what he would do to improve them. Peter interjected occasionally with his own opinions, which barely differed from James\u2019.\nPudding was millionaire shortbread, which neither Sirius or James liked. Remus thought they were mad, and took their distaste as evidence of their snobbery. He\u2019d have eaten theirs too, but Peter got there first, scoffing the lot.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got some sweets,\u201d the smaller boy offered, digging in his robe pockets and withdrawing a bulging brown bag, \u201cMum sent them, help yourself.\u201d\n\u201cCheers Pete!\u201d They dug in, munching their way through fizzing whizzbees, chocolate frogs and flavour changing gobstoppers happily. Remus helped himself to a few as well, until they all felt quite sick.\n\u201cWhat homework were you doing?\u201d James asked, scratching his chin, distractedly, \u201cI thought we\u2019d finished everything for this week.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, um, I was behind on history. Had to go back and check something.\u201d Sirius was scratching too, near his collar bone.\nWatching them made Remus start to itch. The back of his hand tickled as if a small insect was crawling over him. He suddenly thought of the itching powder and looked down.\nHe nearly screamed. The back of his hand was growing thick dark hair, at an alarming rate. He was transforming! It wasn\u2019t anywhere near a full moon \u2013 how could this be happening? He stood up so suddenly he nearly fell over backwards. He had to get out of there \u2013 fast!\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Lupin?\u201d James stared at him, startled.\nRemus looked back at him, then at Sirius.\nThey\nwere both growing hair too \u2013 dark curls sprouted from their faces, their hands and arms \u2013 every bit of exposed skin. He gaped, speechless. He ran his tongue over his teeth \u2013 they weren\u2019t getting any longer.\n\u201cOh bloody hell\u2026\u201d James said, looking down at himself, then at the other two boys, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d\n\u201cPeter,\u201d Sirius growled, his face now almost covered in hair, \u201cAre you\nsure\nyour mum sent those sweets?\u201d\nPeter, who hadn\u2019t had any sweets yet, stared at them both, and turned red, spluttering,\n\u201cWell, I mean\u2026 I\nthought\nthey were from her\u2026 they arrived this morning\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPete!\u201d James roared. People were looking at them, now, turning and nudging each other. Soon, the entire dining hall was whispering and pointing at the three incredibly hairy boys at the Gryffindor table.\nPlenty of people were giggling, too, but of course no one was laughing louder than Severus Snape, over at the Slytherin benches.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Sirius stood up, sticking his furry nose up with an air of aristocratic dignity that was nothing short of hilarious, \u201cLet\u2019s get to the hospital wing. We can plot our revenge later.\u201d\nAs they left to howls of laughter from the rest of the great hall, Remus cringed in shame, covering his face with his hands. Every inch of him was now covered in the same glossy black hair. He didn\u2019t find it as funny as James and Sirius seemed to.\n\u201cTold you they\u2019d strike back,\u201d Sirius muttered."

            "content": "Fortunately, Madam Pomfrey was able to undo the hex with a few flicks of her wand. She still lectured all of them on misuse of dangerous magic.\n\u201cAs if we all wanted to look like bigfoot!\u201d James complained as they left the hospital wing, skin still tinging from the hair growth.\n\u201cIt had to be Severus. He coated the sweets in one of his potions, I know it.\u201d Sirius seethed.\n\u201cYeah, we all know it, mate.\u201d James replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get him back.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d Peter wailed, for about the hundredth time. \u201cI really thought they were from my mum!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Peter,\u201d James patted his shoulder, \u201cJust wish you\u2019d given them to us first thing on a Monday \u2013 then we could have at least bunked off Transfiguration.\u201d\n\u201cI demand retribution!\u201d Sirius shouted, raising his wand dramatically. Remus laughed, James did too,\n\u201cAnd you shall have it!\u201d He replied, pushing his glasses back on his nose, \u201cPatience is a virtue, Black. Vengeance like this takes time. Don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve got any other brilliant ideas, Remus?\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Remus shook his head. His heart was still pounding from the terror of it. If he had seen Snape at that moment he would have throttled him; never mind pranking him.\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you, James,\u201d Peter piped up, \u201cI\u2019ll do\nanything\n, I won\u2019t be scared this time, I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d\nThey were just turning the corner which led to Gryffindor tower when somebody behind them called out,\n\u201cSirius.\u201d\nAll four boys turned. Sirius made a small shocked noise. It was Bellatrix Black.\n\u201cWhaddyou want?\u201d He asked, looking down and scuffing his shoes on the flagstone floor. It was the most un-Sirius posture imaginable, Remus thought. He also noticed that James stepped forward, standing shoulder to shoulder with his friend.\n\u201cCome here and address me properly.\u201d The seventh-year witch snapped in response.\nSirius didn\u2019t move. Bellatrix withdrew her wand \u2013 Remus was shocked, and for the first time since he\u2019d been at Hogwarts, he felt frightened.\n\u201cCome here,\u201d she said, in a low voice, \u201cOr I\u2019ll make you. And it won\u2019t be a childish little hair growth charm, I promise.\u201d\nSirius walked forward, shaking his head at James, who tried to follow. They all watched the cousins speaking in quiet voices at the end of the hallway for long, uncomfortable minutes. Sirius barely looked up from the ground the whole time. Finally, she patted him on the head, then turned on her heel and left. They all exhaled, relieved. Sirius walked back to them shakily.\nIn silence they all entered the portrait hole and sat down at their usual sofa.\n\u201cAlright, Sirius?\u201d James asked, first.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He nodded, looking paler than usual, \u201cShe um\u2026 she wanted to invite me for tea. On my birthday. I think my mother must have made her, probably held a family conference. Try to bring me back into the fold.\u201d\n\u201cJust because you\u2019re in a different house?\u201d\n\u201cAnd the company I\u2019m keeping,\u201d he smirked at them all.\n\u201cSo when\u2019s your birthday?\u201d\n\u201cTwo weeks. The third. I have to go to this tea, though, Bella\u2019s not joking about knowing some really vile curses.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do something afterwards, then. Something good, yeah?\u201d\nPeter and Remus nodded enthusiastically, but in the back of Remus\u2019 mind he remembered that the third was the night of the full moon.\n* * *\nSirius turned twelve and Remus wasn\u2019t there to celebrate it, though he didn\u2019t think anyone minded. James was Sirius\u2019 best friend, after all, and Peter still liked to think that James belonged to him a little bit, too. So Remus would have been the odd one out, even if he hadn\u2019t been locked away in a shack trying to tear himself apart. Madam Pompfrey tried him with a sleeping draught this time, before the moon rose, but it apparently had no effect. What was worse, he managed to give himself his biggest scar yet \u2013 right across his back.\nPomfrey made him stay in the hospital wing all day afterwards, which was actually fortuitous \u2013 it meant he could just tell his friends he\u2019d been suddenly taken ill. They were still a bit confused as to why he hadn\u2019t told them anything about feeling sick beforehand, but went along with it. They probably already thought he was fairly odd, and by now accepted mostly anything he told them.\nHe wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed the birthday. James talked to Madam Hooch and arranged a lunch time flying session for the three of them. After dinner, before Sirius had to go and change for tea with his cousins, James and Peter led the Gryffindor table in a round of \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019, followed by \u2018For he\u2019s a jolly good fellow\u2019. According to the students Remus heard from afterwards, they had sung \u2018and so say all of us!\u2019 over and over, getting louder each time until Professor McGonagall had to threaten them with detention if they didn\u2019t stop.\nAs November marched on, the days grew shorter and the castle darker. They spent less of their time outside, and more of it huddled by the fire in the common room, playing card games and plotting revenge against Snape. The first term was drawing to a close, and the teachers seemed to be piling on more homework than ever.\nWhenever Sirius and Remus were away from Peter and James (usually when the other two were in the library), Sirius was reading to him. They finished\nA History of Magic\nin just under two weeks, and then alternated between\nA Beginner\u2019s Guide to Transfiguration\nand\nMagical Drafts and Potions\nfor the rest of the term. When the marauders worked on their homework as a group, he even took to reading aloud, as if to himself, claiming it helped him think. This was very much to James\u2019 annoyance, who preferred silence.\nThough they couldn\u2019t possibly cover the entire syllabus in such a short time, to everyone\u2019s amazement (including his own) Remus\u2019 marks were improving at an astonishing rate. Sirius had apparently had the right idea; Remus\u2019 ability to retain and recall information was remarkable, and he found himself raising his hand in lessons for the first time in his life.\nSirius\u2019 marks, on the other hand, began to fall. He spent so much time trying to secretly assist Remus, that he apparently no longer did any of the extra reading he\u2019d prided himself in all year. As it was, his own homework became average, passable and fell behind James\u2019 for the first time. James was oblivious, of course, and merely assumed that\nhe\nwas actually improving.\n\u201cBut you spend so much time in the library!\u201d Remus whispered to him once, after Sirius had received an \u2018Acceptable\u2019 mark on his Charms essay. \u201cI thought you were studying.\u201d Remus himself had still not worked up the courage to visit the library. The thought of all of those books horrified him.\n\u201cI am studying,\u201d Sirius replied, cheerily, \u201cJust not this stuff,\u201d he folded the essay away, \u201cI\u2019m looking up cognitive interpretation spells \u2013 you know, so you can read by yourself. It\u2019s really tricky, OWL level, actually, but I think I\u2019ve almost got it. Don\u2019t\nworry\n, Lupin, it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m failing. This is much more interesting, anyway.\u201d\nRemus felt horribly guilty, of course, as well as mildly ashamed that Sirius was devoting so much time to helping him. He honestly could not remember a time in his life that anyone had ever\ntried\nso hard on his behalf. It made him wish he could do something \u2013 anything in return. But, other than having a difficult family, Sirius Black seemed to want for nothing at all.\nIn fact, there was one thing Remus could give Sirius which even James could not \u2013 but it hardly felt worth mentioning. Something Sirius called \u2018muggle insight\u2019. It began when Remus finally plucked up the courage to ask about Sirius\u2019 record collection. Sirius was only too happy to share; other than his racing broom, which was still at home, his albums were his dearest possessions.\nRemus could easily see why \u2013 he had\nIntroducing The Beatles\n,\nA Hard Day\u2019s Night\nand\nHelp\n!, as well as\nAbbey Road\n;\nBeggars Banquet\nand\nSticky Fingers\n(\u201cMick Jagger has to be the coolest muggle I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Sirius gushed), two Led Zeppelin albums \u2013 Remus hadn\u2019t listened to them before, but the older boys at St. Edmund\u2019s were all obsessed \u2013 and a Simon and Garfunkle LP, hidden at the back.\nWizards, it turned out, did not generally think much of muggle music. All of Sirius\u2019 records had been gifted to him by his cousin, Andromeda, who was apparently the first \u2018black sheep\u2019 of the Black family, having left school a few years beforehand and married a muggle.\n\u201cI hardly ever see her,\u201d Sirius explained, \u201cNot since the wedding, but she posts these to me every now and then. She sends them the muggle way, so mum doesn\u2019t find out \u2013 she doesn\u2019t understand how the post office works.\u201d\nSo although he had an impressive collection by any eleven year old\u2019s standards, Sirius\u2019 musical passions existed almost entirely in a vacuum. He wasn\u2019t aware of any other Beatles songs than the ones he already had, pressed into vinyl. He had never listened to the radio, or watched Top of the Pops, or even opened a copy of NME before. As such, he found Remus endlessly fascinating on the subject of music and muggle culture.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve actually\nseen\nthem, though!\u201d He said, awed, \u201cYou\u2019ve\nseen\nthem performing.\u201d\n\u201cNot in real life, or anything,\u201d Remus replied, uncomfortably.\n\u201cNo, I know, on the\ntelephone\n,\u201d Sirius nodded sagely. Remus stifled laughter,\n\u201cOn the tele\nvision\n.\u201d He corrected, \u201cIt\u2019s more like those moving paintings you lot have. Only black and white. And only the Beatles \u2013 the Stones came on once and Matron made us turn it off, because of their hair.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about their hair?\u201d\n\u201cToo long,\u201d Remus shrugged, \u201cShe said they looked dirty.\u201d\n\u201cMy hair\u2019s much longer,\u201d Sirius said, frowning.\n\u201cYeah, it is. But muggle boys don\u2019t have long hair, not normally.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell him that!\u201d Peter teased, \u201cHe\u2019ll shave his head.\u201d He threw a gob stone across the board on the floor \u2013 they\u2019d been playing a lazy game off and on for the past few days, trying to teach Remus the rules. It rolled into one of Sirius\u2019 stones and knocked it out of the ring, immediately squirting out a disgusting smelling liquid, which Sirius barely dodged in time. Peter grinned, \u201cHa, take that, muggle lover!\u201d\nSirius swore, loudly, and left to change his clothes."

            "content": "\u201cLupin, perhaps you can tell me \u2013 what are the transfigurative properties of lapis philosophorum?\u201d McGonagall called out, towards the end of their lesson one day. She gave him a very pointed look \u2013 the last time she\u2019d asked him a question in front of the class he had shrugged and looked away.\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Remus wracked his brain, \u201cWell, I think that\u2019s the one that turns stuff into gold? If you use it right\u2026 and Cleopatra the Alchemist used it to turn lead into silver, I think.\u201d\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d McGonagall sounded as if she was trying to mask her surprise. \u201cFive points to Gryffindor. And another five for making the connection to Cleopatra the Alchemist \u2013 she\u2019s not mentioned in\nTransfiguration for Beginners\n, did you read that in your history text?\u201d\nRemus nodded, aware that everyone was looking at him.\n\u201cWell, excellent. Some of my third-year students are incapable of cross-referencing their studies like that, I\u2019m pleased to see you taking such an interest.\u201d She addressed the class, \u201cAnd we will begin discussing alchemy after Christmas. Which reminds me \u2013 with the holidays approaching, I\u2019d like to ask any students planning to remain at Hogwarts over the break to let me know by the end of next week. Thank you, you\u2019re dismissed.\u201d\nThe class stood up to leave. A few people patted Remus on the back as they passed.\n\u201cMr Lupin, if you have a moment?\u201d McGonagall said, just as he was passing her desk. His stomach dropped. He\u2019d gone two weeks without a detention from her; he should have known something was coming. He stood still, shoving his hands deep in his pockets and staring at his feet as the rest of the class filtered out.\nFinally, the classroom empty, she walked over and shut the door (right in James\u2019 face) and turned back into the room.\n\u201cWell done today, Remus,\u201d McGonagall said, kindly, \u201cYou\u2019ve really been doing well lately.\u201d\nHe looked up at her, startled. She laughed,\n\u201cDon\u2019t look so surprised! I\u2019m very impressed. Professor Slughorn and Professor Flitwick have said the same. I wanted a quick word with you about Christmas. I\u2019ve spoken with Mrs Orwell\u2014\u201c\n\u201cWho?!\u201d\n\u201cThe lady who runs St Edmund\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right, Matron.\u201d\n\u201cQuite. As you know, the full moon will occur twice in December \u2013 the second,\u201d (that was next week) \u201cand the thirty-first. New Year\u2019s Eve. Mrs Orwell seems to be of the opinion that you would be better off remaining at Hogwarts over Christmas for this reason. I hope you aren\u2019t too disappointed.\u201d\nRemus shrugged,\n\u201cI\u2019m not fussed either way.\u201d\nProfessor McGonagall nodded, very seriously.\n\u201cI shall add your name to the list, then. I\u2019ll see you next week, Remus.\u201d\n* * *\nJames invited Sirius and Remus to visit him over the break, knowing that neither of them were facing a particularly merry Christmas otherwise. Remus was forced to decline \u2013 even if he hadn\u2019t been incredibly shy about visiting James\u2019 home and meeting his parents, he was still legally in the care of St Edmund\u2019s local authority, and needed written permission from Matron to leave Hogwarts.\nSirius, who would have loved the opportunity to spend two weeks mucking about with James, racing their brooms and eating chocolate, also had to refuse. His family had made it quite clear that they did not approve of him visiting the Potter family under any circumstances.\n\u201cBellatrix, that bitch, has been feeding my parents information.\u201d He explained, darkly, \u201cApparently, I\u2019ve disgraced them enough already. If I go to yours then it\u2019ll only get worse. Sorry, mate.\u201d\nRemus went to the edge of the grounds with the marauders all to wave them off on the last day of term.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll send you owls!\u201d James promised, \u201cSee if you can come up with our next plan of attack on Snape!\u201d\nRemus grinned and promised he would try. He hoped that the letters James sent would not be too long. He was the only Gryffindor first year staying behind for the break, and trudged a lonely path back up to the castle.\nThe next day he enjoyed lying in \u2013 something they were never allowed to do at St. Edmund\u2019s. He slept until ten o\u2019clock, when Frank Longbottom poked his head around the door,\n\u201cCome on Lupin, you\u2019ll miss breakfast at this rate!\u201d\nRemus liked Frank \u2013 he had a broad, friendly face and an easy-going manner. He seemed altogether solid and dependable, like an older brother. He understood that Remus was used to being an outsider, and tried to include him wherever possible without pushing too hard.\nAfter breakfast Frank disappeared to the owlery and Remus sat glumly in the common room, feeling the next two weeks stretch before him, empty and lonely. He considered a walk around the grounds, but it had started to rain heavily. He played a few of Sirius\u2019 records and flipped through a stack of magazines some fourth years had left behind, just looking at the pictures. They were mostly of pretty, glamorous witches and handsome wizards \u2013 he supposed it was a fashion mag.\nThe next few days passed in much the same way. Frank would get him up in the morning, he\u2019d eat all his meals with the remaining Gryffindors in the Great Hall, but otherwise he was left to his own devices.\nHe was so bored at one point that he even thought about doing some of the homework he\u2019d been set. He\u2019d been trying to improve his handwriting, but it was almost impossible with the ridiculous feather quills they were provided. No one would answer him properly when he asked why they couldn\u2019t just use biro\u2019s. Even pencil might have been better. He actually did try to read for a while, but after attempting a paragraph from his herbology text gave up in frustration. He copied out a few of the diagrams instead \u2013 Remus didn\u2019t mind drawing; he liked the freedom of it.\nEvery day he walked around the castle for a few hours, with his map. The other boys had long since discarded theirs, having learnt all the classroom locations after the first week or so. But Remus hung on to his, still bothered by its incompleteness. He\u2019d begun marking it up himself, adding points of interest, hiding places and the secret passageway he\u2019d found.\n\nThe rest of the time he spent avoiding teachers who were concerned about his being alone. He wasn\u2019t the only student left in the school, but most of the others were sixth and seventh years, who generally stayed in the library revising hard for exams, or working on their coursework. Slughorn was holding special extra Potions classes in the dungeons, but Remus hadn\u2019t been invited and probably wouldn\u2019t have gone anyway.\nHe practiced a few spells, and entertained himself for a good few hours trying to see how many objects in their dorm room he could levitate at once. He made a game of it, throwing various objects \u2013 books, gob stones, decks of cards \u2013 up in the air, and trying to stop them before they hit the ground. He had to stop that, eventually, when Frank knocked on the door and told him irritably to keep the noise down.\n* * *\nSaturday 24\nth\nDecember 1971\nOn Christmas Eve, Remus was woken earlier than usual \u2013 it was still quite dark. Heavy rain pelted the thick glass window panes, the sound of it loud enough to echo through the empty dorm room. But that wasn\u2019t what had disturbed him. The door was creaking open, and someone stepped inside.\nSitting up and peering through the gloom, Remus expected to see Longbottom telling him to get up for breakfast. But it wasn\u2019t Frank. It was a very soggy and dishevelled looking boy, with long hair and a haughty face.\n\u201cSirius!\u201d Remus leapt out of bed, overjoyed to see his friend.\nSirius pushed his wet hair out of his eyes \u2013 he\u2019d clearly been out in the rain. He pulled off his heavy travelling cloak, dropping it in a pile on the floor.\n\u201cAlright, Lupin?\u201d He grinned. \u201cFreezing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He pointed his wand at the fireplace, \u201c\nIncendio\n.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?!\u201d\n\u201cHad enough,\u201d He said simply, pulling off his boots, which were caked in mud. \u201cGot into an argument with Dad, then the whole family got into it. All the usual stuff. Called me a blood traitor, the shame of the family, et cetera, et cetera\u2026\u201d He flopped down on his bed. \u201cSo I left.\u201d\n\u201cWow.\u201d Remus rubbed his eyes, awestruck. \u201cHow did you get here?\u201d\n\u201cFloo powder.\u201d Sirius shrugged, \u201cTo the pub in the village. Then just walked up.\u201d\n\u201cWow.\u201d Remus repeated.\n\u201cI\u2019m starving, they sent me to bed last night without dinner. Come on, get dressed! Breakfast!\u201d\nMcGonagall was not as pleased to see Sirius as Remus was. The two boys attempted to take their seats at the table as if nothing was out of the ordinary, but she appeared at their side almost immediately.\n\u201cMr Black.\u201d She said, a note of warning in her voice which Remus recognised from his detentions. \u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d\n\u201cI missed you too, Professor.\u201d He grinned up at her.\nThe corner of the old witch\u2019s mouth twitched, but she kept her composure.\n\u201cYou were seen walking onto the grounds from Hogsmead at six o\u2019clock this morning. Do you care to explain yourself further?\u201d\nSirius shook his head,\n\u201cNot really, Professor. That\u2019s pretty much all there is to it.\u201d\nMcGonagall sighed, shaking her head lightly. She had the same look of pity she usually reserved for Remus.\n\u201cVery well, Mr Black. I shall have to contact your parents, of course, so that they know where you are.\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Sirius replied, nodding at the flock of owls which had just swooped into the room. The largest of these birds, a huge, stately eagle owl, dropped a thick red envelope onto Sirius\u2019 plate. He looked down at it, then up at McGonagall with a wry smile, \u201cI think they know exactly where I am.\u201d\nHe picked up the ominous envelope, and, without breaking eye contact with McGonagall, ripped it open. Almost immediately, the letter began to shriek. The voice was so loud that it filled the entire hall, causing heads to turn. McGonagall winced at the ear-splitting pitch of it. It was the voice of Sirius\u2019 mother.\n\u201cSIRIUS ORION BLACK,\u201d it shrieked, \u201cHOW DARE YOU DEFY YOUR FATHER IN THIS MANNER!\u201d Remus covered his ears. Sirius remained perfectly still, looking up at McGonagall, \u201cCONSORTING WITH HALF BREEDS AND BLOOD TRAITORS! TURNING YOUR BACK ON YOUR FAMILY! IF YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS ALIVE HE\u2019D HAVE DISOWNED YOU THE MOMENT YOU WERE SORTED! YOU WILL REMAIN AT SCHOOL UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AND THINK ABOUT THE SHAME AND DISHONOUR YOU HAVE BROUGHT TO YOUR NOBLE TITLE! DON\u2019T THINK WE WON\u2019T DISINHERIT YOU! YOU ARE\nNOT\nOUR ONLY SON!\u201d\nWith that, the letter burst into flames, curling and shrivelling into a pile of chalk white ash. The silence that followed was deafening. Everyone was staring.\nSirius reached for some toast, put it on his plate, then began ladling scrambled egg onto it, nonchalantly. He glanced up at McGonagall again,\n\u201cYou can send mother an owl if you like, Professor, but I doubt she\u2019ll read it.\u201d\n\u201cVery well, Sirius,\u201d McGonagall nodded, \u201cJust\u2026 try to keep out of trouble, will you?\u201d With that, she walked stiffly back to the teachers table at the far end of the hall.\nSirius ate his breakfast in silence. Years later, Remus would always remember thinking in that moment that Sirius Black must be the bravest boy in the world.\n* * *\nChristmas day at St Edmund\u2019s was usually an extremely noisy affair. Some boys got presents delivered \u2013 those with distant relatives who cared enough to send a new sweatshirt perhaps, but not enough to visit \u2013 others made do with the usual selection of donations from the locals, which Matron had wrapped up for them. Gift-getting was quickly followed by gift-swapping, and they often passed the morning bartering and trading the meagre items they\u2019d received. They were made to smarten themselves up, then led in a long line down to the church, where they would sit through the Christmas service, bored and slouching.\nChristmas morning at Hogwarts was a good deal more pleasant. Remus was almost touched to find that Matron had not forgotten him \u2013 the post had arrived overnight and at the end of his bed he found a card from her, as well as a lumpy package which contained a bag of nuts, an orange, and a tin of biscuits. To his amazement, James had also sent a present \u2013 his very own set of gob stones. Peter had even sent a box of chocolate frogs.\n\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d Sirius yawned, opening his own gifts. He had nothing from his parents, as far as Remus would see, but didn\u2019t mention it. James had sent him an annual of his favourite quidditch team, the South End Scorchers, and he had a box of frogs from Peter too.\n\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d Remus returned, \u201cI didn\u2019t get anyone any presents,\u201d He admitted guiltily. \u201cI didn\u2019t know they would\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Sirius replied, on his way to the bathroom, \u201cNo one expected you to.\u201d\nThis troubled Remus, but he tried not to think about it. While Sirius was in the loo, another owl flew in the window and dropped a large, flat, square package on his bed. When Sirius came out and saw it, his eyes lit up and he ripped it open, eagerly,\n\u201cIt\u2019s from Andromeda!\u201d He explained, pulling the record out, showing it to Remus, who hurried over excitedly.\nIt was another muggle album. The cover was black, printed with the silhouetted image of a man standing in front of a huge amplifier, playing a guitar. He had long, wildly curly hair, stood with his legs apart in a power stance, outlined in gold.\nElectric Warrior\n, the title blared,\nT-Rex\n.\n\u201cOhh, T-Rex, I think I\u2019ve heard of them,\u201d Remus said, as Sirius flipped it over to read the track listing.\n\u201cStick it on!\u201d Remus encouraged, impatient. Who cared what the cover said?\nSirius did, sliding out the slick black disc and settling it onto his turntable. The record began to turn, and the room filled with music \u2013 a smooth, sliding throb.\n\u2018\nBeneath the bebop moon/I wanna croon/With you-ooo\u2026\n\u2019\nThey sat and listened entranced, stopping only to flip to the B-side. Once it was over, Sirius wordlessly turned it over and began at the beginning again. They alternated between sitting on the bed, swaying slightly to the melody, or nodding their heads as the beats quickened. They shared grins with each other at the catchiest riffs, and lay down to stare at the ceiling for the slower, dreamier tracks.\nEventually, halfway through the second listen, Frank came in,\n\u201cMerry Christmas lads \u2013 come on, breakfast!\u201d\nThey dressed quickly and went down to the dining hall. The Great Hall had been decorated garishly by the teachers \u2013 glittering ropes of tinsel in red, green and gold sparkled from every rafter, hanging down like festive jungle vines. Twelve enormous trees twinkled with lights in every colour imaginable, and baubles the size of footballs hung from every branch.\nAfter breakfast, the boys ran back upstairs to listen to the album again.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d Remus declared. Sirius nodded, solemnly.\nSirius\u2019 favourite song was Jeepster \u2013 he loved the twanging chords, the aggressive thump of it. Remus like Monolith best; it was spacey and smooth, the words both nonsensical and meaningful at the same time. It made him feel like he was floating.\nFor the rest of the day they played music in the common room, ate their way through the chocolate frogs, nuts and biscuits, and played rowdy games of exploding snap. Meals at Hogwarts were always spectacular, and Christmas dinner was no different. By the time night had fallen, Remus had eaten so much he thought he might never be hungry again.\nThough he didn\u2019t say it to Sirius (who, after all, had been forced to run away from home for the first \u2013 if not the last \u2013 time), it was Remus\u2019 best Christmas ever."

            "content": "Tuesday 27\nth\nDecember 1971\nWith Boxing Day over and done with, Remus and Sirius found themselves caught in those strange nowhere days between Christmas day and New Year\u2019s Day, as they awaited their friends\u2019 return.\u00a0 Sirius was keen to plan their revenge on Snape \u2013 in fact, he was no longer interested in attacking all of the Slytherin\u2019s anymore, wanting to focus his energies on one single nemesis.\nRemus was inclined to agree. He had been too furious with Snape to think clearly about it for the past few weeks. He couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that Severus had somehow hit upon the exact hex that would cause Remus the most upset. He didn\u2019t know quite how the Slytherin boy had managed it \u2013 and it was very likely just a clever guess \u2013 but he didn\u2019t care.\n\u201cWe should just get James\u2019 cloak, follow him around \u2018til he\u2019s alone, then beat the shit out of him.\u201d Remus growled, as they sat in the empty common room one evening. He gripped the arm of the settee as he said this, feeling the leather creak under his grasp. It was getting close to the full moon and his temper was closer to the surface than usual.\n\u201cNow, now, Lupin,\u201d Sirius chastised smoothly, carrying a pile of books he\u2019d brought from the library. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking like a muggle. If we\u2019re going to get him, we\u2019re going to get him with magic.\u201d\n\u201cNot more books.\u201d Remus whined, as Sirius plopped down beside him, an enormous tome in his arms. He opened it, and it was so big that the cover rested across both of their skinny legs.\n\u201cYes, more books.\u201d Sirius replied, breezily. \u201cYou\u2019ll love them once you get to know them, I promise.\u201d\nRemus wasn\u2019t so sure about that. It was true, he\u2019d grown to quite like their secret study sessions, and had been privately amazed at the amount he had learnt. But listening to Sirius was one thing \u2013 sitting down alone and staring at a block of text was another thing altogether. Still, Sirius kept promising him that he was getting closer to a solution.\n\u201cSo what\u2019s this one about?\u201d Remus asked, resigned to his fate. If Sirius wanted to do something, there was very little anyone could do to stop him. You just had to hold on tight until it was over.\n\u201cHexes and jinxes. A lot of them are really complex, though. I mean, we\u2019re\ngood\n\u2013 you, me and James, anyway \u2013 but I still think we should stick to the basics. Simplicity is key.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d Remus replied, dully. He still preferred the idea of a surprise beating.\n\u201cSo I thought we could brainstorm all the stuff we can do, and see if that lends itself to any good jinxes.\u201d Sirius continued, undeterred by Remus\u2019 reluctance, \u201cSo, I\u2019m really good at transfiguration \u2013 I got the best marks even after you started catching up.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Remus agreed,\n\u201cAnd James is a\nbit\nbetter than me at Defence Against the Dark Arts \u2013 which you\u2019d think would be helpful when dealing with a slimy creep like Snivellus, but we haven\u2019t really learnt any good spells yet, except disarming stuff, and that\u2019s no use.\u201d\nHe chewed the nib of his quill, considering. It wasn\u2019t a new quill, and left a dark stain on Sirius\u2019 bottom lip. Remus didn\u2019t say anything. Sirius carried on, \u201cJames is good at flying, too, obviously, but I dunno how that\u2019s going to be any help. Then there\u2019s Pete\u2026 good at sneaking around and grunt work, I suppose\u2026\u201d\nRemus thought that was rather unfair. Peter was never top of the class like Sirius and James, but he was generally perfectly competent, usually settling for a satisfactory mark. He lacked the competitive edge James and Sirius had, the desire to prove himself. Remus recognised this well enough \u2013 it was enough just to be friends with cleverer, more confident people, sometimes. You got a bit of their shine with none of the pressure.\n\u201cPete\u2019s good at Herbology,\u201d Remus pointed out, \u201cAnd Potions.\u201d\n\u201cBoth useless.\u201d Sirius shrugged, \u201c\nYou\nwere the one who came up with the rosehip thing, and we\u2019re never going to best Snape at Potions \u2013 I hate to admit it, but the bastard\u2019s too good. Anyway, then we\u2019ve got you; you\u2019re probably best at Charms.\u201d\n\u201cNot\nbest\n,\u201d Remus said, hurriedly, \u201cI\u2019m good at levitation, I suppose, but that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\u201cOh shut up, this is no time for modesty, Lupin,\u201d Sirius waved an impatient hand, \u201cYou pick up spells quicker than anyone. If we find a sufficiently hideous hex in here, then I\u2019m counting on you to figure out how to do it.\u201d\nRemus squirmed. He hated when Sirius talked like that \u2013 as if Remus was as clever, or as gifted as he and James were. He knew it wasn\u2019t true, and it embarrassed him. He fought a sudden urge to push the big heavy book off their laps and walk away.\nIt was just the full moon, he told himself. He felt fidgety and too hot by the fire, too close to Sirius, who\u2019s blood he could smell, mixed in with the unique scent of magic. He vaguely hoped that dinner would be red meat \u2013 something he could taste the iron in.\n\u201cIt has to be something big,\u201d Sirius murmured, flipping all the way to the back of the book \u2013 Remus let out a yelp as the full weight of it thudded against his thighs. Sirius ignored this, running a finger down the index. \u201cSomething much worse than the hair thing.\u201d\nRemus shuddered at the thought of Snape\u2019s prank. Rage surged up in him again. Or was it hunger? He shook his head, pushing the book away and getting up, pretending he just had to stretch. His joints ached already as his body prepared itself for the coming transformation.\n\u201cI dunno why you think I\u2019ll be any help.\u201d Remus sighed, yawning now.\n\u201cMuggle insight.\u201d Sirius grinned. \u201cLike the itching powder. You can come up with stuff Snape won\u2019t see coming.\u201d\nRemus scratched his head, wracking his brain,\n\u201cCan\u2019t think of anything\nbad\nenough,\u201d he said, \u201cOnce we got a bucket of water and propped it up over a door \u2013 which you have to leave a bit ajar, y\u2019know, then Matron was supposed to walk through and get soaked. Except Matron didn\u2019t walk through, the cook did, and we got served shit food for a month.\u201d His stomach growled at the mention of food. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty tame prank, to be honest. Are you hungry? Can we go down for dinner yet?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I s\u2019pose,\u201d Sirius closed the book. \u201cWe could get a bucket pretty easily, but it seems like there\u2019s a lot of room for error. And I dunno if it would really strike fear into his heart the way we want it to. We\u2019re marauders, we should be setting certain standards.\u201d\nRemus chuckled as they climbed through the portrait hole,\n\u201cYeah, told you it was rubbish. Shame, \u2018cause Snivellus could do with a good wash.\u201d\nSirius laughed back. Then he froze, and gripped Remus\u2019 shoulder,\n\u201cOh, you genius! You bloody genius!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Remus replied, shocked and a bit annoyed to be shaken about like that.\n\u201cA good wash! That\u2019s what we\u2019ll do! It\u2019s easy, I bet, it\u2019ll be in one of those books\u2026 wait here!\u201d He disappeared back through the portrait. Remus sighed, hungrily, and waited.\n* * *\n\u201cSo wait, explain it to me again?\u201d Remus whispered, as they finished their plates. He used the remains of his roast potato to mop up what remained of the gravy. He might have seconds \u2013 he ate like a horse on the nights before the moon. \u201cIt sounds complicated.\u201d\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d Sirius shook his head, \u201cI reckon it\u2019s easy. Weather spells are hard on a grand scale, but this only needs to be a cloud the size of this plate.\u201d He tapped the porcelain in front of him.\n\u201cWould it be like the ceiling?\u201d Remus asked, jerking his head up at the charmed rafters. It was raining, as it had been all Christmas, but the downpour vanished before it reached them.\n\u201cA bit,\u201d Sirius replied, \u201cBut smaller. And without whatever charms are stopping us from getting wet.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 couldn\u2019t he just step away from it?\u201d\n\u201cNot if we combine it with a binding spell!\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 we can\u2019t mix spells yet. Well, I can\u2019t. Can you?\u201d He looked up at Sirius, who was nodding vigorously,\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been having a go at it, for your reading thing. It\u2019s actually not too hard; you just have to concentrate.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they say about reading,\u201d Remus sighed.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll practice.\u201d Sirius said, firmly, \u201cWe\u2019ll practice loads, before James and Pete get back. They\u2019ll be dead impressed.\u201d\nThere was no time for seconds after that, so Remus had to satisfy himself with the remainder of his Christmas biscuits as Sirius looked up weather charms. Once he\u2019d found what he wanted, they both took it in turns to have a go, Sirius reading out the directions several times before they understood them.\nIt was the first time Remus had attempted a spell without having it demonstrated for him first. Daunting to begin with, he quickly understood how the wand movement ought to flow and twist, while Sirius was best at pronunciation. It did take a lot of concentration, and it was nearly midnight by the time either of them had produced anything at all. Finally, Remus managed to cast a small, grey cloud. It poured from his wand like smoke, then hovered between them for a few moments before bursting like a bubble, leaving only a faint trace of condensation.\nSirius grinned, broadly,\n\u201cThis is going to work!\u201d\n* * *\nSaturday 31\nst\nDecember 1971\nIt was hard to shake off Sirius on the night of the full moon. Remus even told him he was feeling sick, but then the other boy wanted to accompany him to the hospital wing. Eventually he managed to convince him that he ought to stay behind and keep practicing the raincloud charm.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve basically got it now, though.\u201d Sirius complained. It was true, they\u2019d both managed to produce satisfactory miniature rainstorms \u2013 the bathroom had almost flooded in the process. It was just a matter of maintaining concentration, and perfecting the binding aspect now.\n\u201cFind something else to do, then.\u201d Remus snapped, halfway out the door, skin crawling, stomach growling. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know she\u2019ll keep you overni--?!\u201d\nRemus had escaped before having to answer any more questions. He was getting careless, he thought to himself as he knocked on McGonagall\u2019s office door. Eventually he\u2019d have to think of a decent excuse for all of his absences. They were sure to connect the nights he vanished to the full moon eventually \u2013 they all did astronomy together.\nThe shack was cold, the walls damp from the relentless rain. Remus wished he\u2019d brought his wand; he\u2019d learnt to cast a good fire charm now. But he supposed it would be no good if there was a fire blazing when he turned. He might burn the whole place down.\nThe transformation came on more suddenly than usual. Ever since Madam Pomfrey had told him they would get worse, he seemed to feel it more. He still fought not to scream, worried that McGonagall or Pomfrey might hear him on their way out of the tunnel. He didn\u2019t need any more pity.\n* * *\nSunday 1\nst\nJanuary 1972\nThe next day, Remus could barely get up after he\u2019d changed back. He pulled a blanket around himself instead, and lay on the floor waiting for Madam Pomfrey to arrive. Every inch of him hurt, more than ever. His head pounded as if a troll had stomped on it. Every tooth in his jaw ached, the tendons in his shoulders felt as if they\u2019d been stretched so far they had snapped. He\u2019d broken almost all of his fingernails. There were huge claw marks in the wallpaper.\n\u201cRemus?\u201d Madam Pomfrey\u2019s soft voice came through the door, \u201cI\u2019m coming in now, dear.\u201d\nHe closed his eyes, unable even to groan.\n\u201cOh,\u201d She said, as she entered the room and found him on the floor, \u201cBad one, was it? Perhaps it\u2019s the solstice, I\u2019ll have to consult my books. Can you get up, Remus?\u201d She touched his forehead with the back of her hand.\nHe opened his eyes and nodded weakly, taking her arm and hauling himself up. That was a mistake. As soon as he was on his feet his head swam and his stomach lurched. He bent forward and vomited onto the floor.\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d Madam Pomfrey said, kindly, an arm around his trembling shoulder. She pointed her wand at the mess and it vanished in an instant, \u201cNo harm done. Let\u2019s get you somewhere warm now, shall we?\u201d\nShe wanted to magic a stretcher to carry him back to the castle, but he couldn\u2019t bear the shame of it, no matter how early in the morning it was. They walked back, very slowly, and up to the hospital wing, where he finally collapsed into a clean, soft bed. The nurse continued to fuss around him, but he was already drifting to sleep.\nHe woke up feeling marginally better. His headache had left him, anyway. He blinked blearily, reaching for the glass of water beside him. Someone picked it up and handed it to him. He drank deeply, then set it down, looking up expecting to see Madam Pomfrey. He jumped,\n\u201cSirius!\u201d He rasped, his throat still sore. God, had he actually been\nhowling\n? How embarrassing.\n\u201cHappy new year,\u201d Sirius said, cheerily. He was sitting on the little wooden stool put there for visitors, clutching a book to his chest. \u201cThought I\u2019d come looking when you weren\u2019t at breakfast. You all right?\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Remus said, sitting up, hurriedly, rubbing his head, \u201cI um\u2026 I get migraines sometimes. I\u2019m feeling better.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d Sirius nodded, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve got your Christmas present ready.\u201d\n\u201cMy\u2026 what?\u201d Remus stared at Sirius warily. His blue eyes were bright and full of mischief.\n\u201cSorry it\u2019s late,\u201d He was saying, \u201cI had a few last-minute tweaks to make. Here.\u201d He handed over the book. It was Remus\u2019 copy of\nA History of Magic\n.\n\u201cWhat..?\u201d Remus wasn\u2019t sure if he was just having a very odd dream. Why was Sirius giving him his own history book?\n\u201cOpen it!\u201d\nRemus did. He had hardly opened the book all year, and the pages were still stiff and immaculate, except for the very first page. Below the title, Sirius had written something in his own neat cursive handwriting. Remus squinted at it, his mouth twisting with effort. He was already exhausted, he didn\u2019t have the energy for riddles.\n\u201cSirius,\u201d He sighed, \u201cYou know I can\u2019t\u2014\u201c\n\u201cPut your hand on it!\u201d Sirius said, eagerly, stepping forward, \u201cPalm flat against the page \u2013 yeah, like that. Now, give me a moment\u2026\u201d\nHe withdrew his wand from his pocket and paced the point lightly against Remus\u2019 temple.\n\u201cSirius, what are you doing?!\u201d Remus was alarmed \u2013 he\u2019d never had a wand pointed at him before, and he\u2019d seen Sirius blow up bigger things than his head.\n\u201cTrust me!\u201d Sirius shushed him. A look of concentration came over his face. He took a deep breath. Remus squeezed his eyes shut, preparing for the worst. At least he was already in the hospital wing. \u201c\nLectiuncula\n\nMagna\n!\u201d Sirius said, forcefully.\nRemus felt an odd jolt, as if he\u2019d missed the last step on a staircase. It hadn\u2019t hurt, exactly, and at least his head was still attached. He opened his eyes and looked at Sirius,\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\n\u201cLook at the book!\u201d Sirius pointed, practically dancing on the spot with excitement, \u201cTell me what it says!\u201d\nRemus sighed, and looked down at the book in his lap. It was exactly the same; a blank white page with Sirius\u2019 slightly slanted thick black handwriting. He stared at it, not sure what he was supposed to be doing.\n\u201cRead it!\u201d Sirius prompted.\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Remus looked down, and looked at the first word.\n\n\u2018Happy\u2019\n\nA voice in his head said. Remus blinked in shock \u2013 he\u2019d never heard the voice before, though it sounded like him. It was almost like the sorting hat, only more familiar, less invasive. He looked again.\n\n\u2018Happy Christmas,\u2019\n\n--it read;\n\n\u2018Now you can do your own bloody homework. From your fellow marauder and friend, Sirius Black.\u2019\n\nRemus laughed. He looked at Sirius, then back at the page. He split the book open to a middle page, looking at the words printed there:\n\n\u2018during the late sixteenth century, Cornelius Agrippa made his greatest advancements in the field of natural magic\u2026\u2019\n\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d Remus exclaimed. He flipped a page again, and read more. The voice continued, confidently. He could read. \u201cOh my GOD!\u201d\n\u201cIt worked, then?!\u201d Sirius asked, beaming.\n\u201cSirius! This is\u2026 you!... I can\u2019t\u2026 How?!\u201d\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Sirius chuckled, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me I\u2019ve messed up your brain so much you can\u2019t even form a coherent sentence?\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Was all Remus could say. He could feel his eyes stinging with tears, and immediately rubbed them hard with his fists. Sirius looked away, politely.\n\u201cS\u2019ok,\u201d he replied, \u201cNow you can help me research our next big prank.\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t even got the first one off the ground yet,\u201d Remus replied, sniffing hard, pulling himself together. \u201cYou have to show me how you did this\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 I mean, it must be really advanced magic.\u201d\n\u201cSort of,\u201d Sirius shrugged, \u201cI got the idea after Mother\u2019s howler, actually. I thought if you can get a letter to scream at someone, then you can get a book to read to someone. Keeping the voice it in your head was the hardest part \u2013 I couldn\u2019t tell if it was working on me or if I was just reading normally. Works on any book, though. I think. Not sure about other stuff yet, like potion labels or signs, but we can keep working on it\u2026\u201d\nRemus couldn\u2019t stop staring that the book, reading random lines and grinning to himself. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever been so happy in his life."

            "content": "Sunday 2\nnd\nJanuary 1972\n\u201cBrilliant!\u201d James exclaimed, slamming his hand down on the bathroom counter, \u201cCompletely brilliant!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so clever!\u201d Peter gushed.\nThe four of them were crammed into the small shared bathroom. Sirius was standing in the bath, fully dressed, holding an umbrella over his head, while Remus pointed his wand at a grey storm cloud hovering just above that. It was pouring rain. Sirius shuffled up and down the bathtub, but the cloud stayed firmly above his head, following his every move.\nJames and Peter had arrived back from their Christmas holidays only two hours ago, and as soon as dinner was over Remus and Sirius had dragged them upstairs for a demonstration.\n\u201cLupin gave me the idea, but\nI\nlooked up the charms to do it,\u201d Sirius beamed, proudly, \u201cHe won\u2019t know what\u2019s hit him!\u201d\n\u201cWhen can we do it?!\u201d James was jumping up and down now, ready to explode with excitement. \u201cFirst thing tomorrow? Breakfast? Potions?\u201d\n\u201cDinner,\u201d Sirius shook his head, \u201cMore of an audience.\u201d\n\u201cYes, dinner,\u201d James nodded, wisely, as if the idea had been his own. \u201cSeriously, you two, I\u2019m so bloody proud.\u201d\n\u201cCheers,\u201d Sirius raised an ironic eyebrow. Then he looked at Remus, \u201cUm\u2026 Lupin? You can probably stop now. My feet are getting wet.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Remus shook off the charm, seeing that he had produced more rain than the ancient plug hole could manage, and Sirius was now ankle deep in cold water, the bottom of his robes soaked. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Sirius laughed, stepping out of the bath and squeezing out his robes, \u201cJust make sure you do the same to Snape.\u201d\n\u201cSo, Lupin\u2019s doing this one?\u201d James asked. Sirius shrugged,\n\u201cHe\u2019s better at it. I can do it too though, if we get interference.\u201d\n* * *\nMonday 3\nrd\nJanuary 1972\nThe first day of lessons after Christmas was a very strange one. James, Sirius and Peter were full of nervous energy in anticipation of the practical joke. Remus was looking forward to that too \u2013 though somewhat nervous as it was he who had to pull it off. But he had another reason to be excited. It would be the first school day in his entire academic career that he would be able to read.\nSirius had shown him how to perform the spell, and it\nwas\nvery difficult \u2013 in the end Remus just had the other boy perform it for him most of the time, deciding to devote more time to learning how to do it himself later. His magic was still slightly wonky following the full moon, liable to overreach and \u2018go off\u2019 if he concentrated too hard. It didn\u2019t seem like a good idea to turn his wand on himself until the moon waned enough and he had more control.\nThe first half of the day was everything he had hoped it might be. He couldn\u2019t read the blackboard, but Charms was mostly practice based, and it amazed Remus how much easier everything became when he could just consult his text without having to remember everything Flitwick had said about softening charms. He was the first in the class to get his brick to bounce \u2013 much to the consternation of Lily Evans, who was usually the top Charms student.\nIt was in the afternoon, during Potions, that things began to go awry. It began with Slughorn returning their essays on the twelve uses of dragon blood. Remus had completed his before Christmas with help from Sirius, and the marauders as a whole did fairly well. As usual, Snape got the highest mark and earned five points for Slytherin. Lily was second and got a point for Gryffindor. She had only beaten Sirius by a few marks.\nNone of this was at all out of the ordinary \u2013 but apparently the tension of anticipation had grown too much for Sirius, and he couldn\u2019t resist getting a shot in,\n\u201cWonder if it\u2019s worth cosying up to Snivellus just for a one measly house point.\u201d He grumbled, loud enough for Lily and Snape to hear. Lily spun around, two bright pink patches on her cheeks,\n\u201cShut up, Black,\u201d she hissed, \u201cNo one likes a sore loser.\u201d\n\u201cHardly losing when your boyfriend lets you copy his work.\u201d Sirius whispered back, venomously.\n\u201cI do\nnot\ncopy him, and Severus is\nnot\nmy boyfriend!\u201d Lily\u2019s face was getting redder.\n\u201cYou\u2019re blushing, Evans,\u201d Sirius smirked, pleased with himself. He nudged James, \u201cIsn\u2019t that sweet?\u201d James sniggered, nodding along.\n\u201cIgnore them, Lily,\u201d Snape whispered, without turning his head, \u201cThey\u2019re just jealous.\u201d\n\u201cJealous of what, Snivellus?\u201d James jumped in, still trying to keep his voice down, \u201cJealous of a slimy greasy git like you? Keep dreaming.\u201d\nSirius laughed, pleased to have drawn James in. Peter laughed too, so as not to be left out. Slughorn was still oblivious, now with his back to the class as he scribbled instructions on the blackboard.\nSeverus finally turned in his chair. He turned his beady black eyes on Sirius,\n\u201cI hear you had a very quiet Christmas, Black,\u201d he said, his voice low and full of danger, \u201cYour family couldn\u2019t stand to have you around for more than a few days before packing you off back to school, is that right?\u201d His lips curled, cruelly, \u201cAll of the pureblood families are talking about it \u2013 the Black\u2019s black sheep.\u201d\nSirius clenched his fists, Remus saw his knuckles turn white.\n\u201cShut. Your. Face.\u201d Sirius growled, through gritted teeth.\n\u201cYeah, watch it, Snape,\u201d James was frowning, \u201cYou\u2019d better be careful what you say. Never know what might happen.\u201d\n\u201cIs that a threat, Potter?\u201d Snape replied, sounding bored, \u201cForgive me if I\u2019m not quaking in my boots. Going to set Loony Lupin on me again?\u201d\nRemus, who had been half-listening to the posturing and half-listening to Slughorn\u2019s instructions, flinched involuntarily. He\u2019d had that nickname before. It was actually impressive that no one at Hogwarts hadn\u2019t said it yet, especially when he knew he had a reputation for being a bit odd. Had everyone been calling him that, behind his back?\nReflexively, he picked up his wand. Snape saw, and his smirk grew even meaner,\n\u201cOh my, have you actually learnt some\nmagic\n, Lupin? I\u2019m impressed. Mind you, I\u2019ve heard they can train some monkey\u2019s to perform basic tricks, so I suppose it\u2019s no real achievement.\u201d\nRemus raised his wand, but Sirius grabbed his wrist and pushed it down on the desk.\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d he muttered.\nRemus clenched his jaw and looked back at the blackboard, seething internally. Snape chuckled and turned away too. Remus heard Lily whisper angrily,\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so horrid to him!\u201d\nRemus could barely concentrate on the rest of the lesson. He knew he shouldn\u2019t care what Snape thought of him, or anyone, for that matter. But the Slytherin boy\u2019s barbs dug in and could not be shaken loose. Sirius didn\u2019t help; he kept murmuring \u2018we\u2019ll show him!\u2019 under his breath, throwing dark looks in Snape\u2019s direction.\nBy the time dinner rolled around, Remus was white hot with rage and the desire to prove himself. He barely ate a thing, and it was Shepherd\u2019s Pie, one of his favourites. He glared at Snape from across the room. This did not go unnoticed, and Severus nudged the boys around him, pointing at the marauders and laughing. Remus thought he could make out the words \u2018loony Lupin\u2019. James and Sirius scowled at them. Lily noticed too,\n\u201cYou lot just leave Sev alone, ok?\u201d She squeaked, \u201cThis stupid fight is going to go on forever if none of you can be mature enough to\u2014\u201c\n\u201cGive it a rest, Evans,\u201d James rolled his eyes, \u201cBad enough you have to be friends with the tosser, now you\u2019re trying to defend him? Where\u2019s your house loyalty, eh?\u201d\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with\nhouses\n,\u201d She snapped, \u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous spat over nothing.\u201d\n\u201cHe insulted Remus!\u201d\n\u201cYou all pick on him all the time!\u201d\n\u201cHe\nstarted\nit!\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, so you have to finish it, right, Potter?!\u201d She stood up, suddenly, picking up her bag, \u201cGod, you\u2019re so full of yourselves!\u201d She walked away, her patent shoes clicking angrily on the flagstones.\n\u201cLoves a fight, that one,\u201d James grinned.\nThere was a yelp of laughter from the Slytherin table and Remus decided he had had enough. He stood up too, pulled out his wand and pointed it at Severus.\n\u201c\nLigare Pluviam\n!\u201d\nIt was instantaneous and perfectly glorious. The raincloud shot from Remus\u2019 wand with the speed of a bullet, so no one could even see where it had come from. It rested over Snape\u2019s head, thick, grey and heavy. There was a low roll of thunder, and the downpour began.\nHe didn\u2019t know what was happening at first, covering his head with his hands and looking up. The students sitting either side of Snape stood up and backed away, not wanting to get wet. Then Snape stood up, trying to dodge the cloud, but it followed him, hovering persistently, rain bucketing down.\nPeople were laughing now, and pointing. Everyone was looking around, trying to see who had done it, but no one had seen Remus cast it, except for his friends. He sat down, but kept his wand trained on Severus, grinning as he watched the boy still trying to run away from the mini-storm.\n\u201cYes!\u201d Sirius\u2019 hissed in his ear, \u201cBloody\nyes\n, Lupin, you beauty!\u201d\nThe immense satisfaction Remus felt was compounded by the laughter echoing around him. Snape was such a nasty, spiteful boy, even some of the Slytherins looked pleased to see him get what he deserved. The more Remus thought about it, the more he wanted to punish him, and the harder it rained. In fact, the cloud seemed to darken and swell.\nSnape was completely soaked now, his hair plastered to his head, getting in his eyes. His skin was pale and his robes shining with water, a puddle forming beneath him. Remus grinned as he watched Severus try desperately to escape, looking more and more like a drowned rat.\n\u201cStop it!\u201d Lily was screeching at James, \u201cI know it\u2019s you! Stop it now!\u201d\nJames kept laughing and held up his hands to show that he wasn\u2019t doing anything. Lily looked close to tears.\nSeverus made to run, arms over his head to stop the rain pelting him, but his robes were so heavy and so waterlogged that he half tripped, half slid and collapsed to the floor. Remus would have laughed, but his concentration deepened. The rain fell harder still, until it was difficult even to see Severus through the grey sheets. The cloud was bigger too, and crackling with thunder and lightning \u2013 it had never done that when he\u2019d practiced on Sirius. But then, he hadn\u2019t been as angry at Sirius.\n\u201cStop it! Please!\u201d Lily was sobbing now. James had stopped laughing. He touched Remus\u2019 arm,\n\u201cEr\u2026 Remus? He\u2019s had enough, mate\u2026\u201d\nSnape wasn\u2019t getting up. Remus realised that no one was laughing any more, and a few people were screaming.\n\u201c\nFINITE\n.\u201d A voice boomed out over the dining hall.\nAt once, the rain stopped. Everyone was silent. Dumbledore stood in the entranceway \u2013 Remus hadn\u2019t seen him since Halloween. He looked perfectly calm, despite the chaos he had just ended. The headmaster swept into the room, vanishing all of the water with a wave of his wand, and bending over Severus.\nRemus put away his wand and shrank into his seat, watching Dumbledore whispering over Snape\u2019s prone body. Lily was still sobbing, and ran over to stand beside Dumbledore, trembling and frightened.\n\u201cEverybody to your dormitories, please,\u201d Dumbledore spoke quietly, but was somehow heard by everyone in the huge hall, \u201cMiss Evans, please fetch Madam Pomfrey.\u201d\nLily ran from the room, and the other students began to file out, obediently. James, Sirius and Remus all shot nervous glances at each other before hurrying to join the rest of their house."

            "content": "Most of the Gryffindors hung around in the common room, gossiping and chattering, all wondering who could have done it. The marauders, usually keen to be at the centre of any debate, all crept upstairs, pale faced with guilt.\nRemus sat on his bed, staring at the floor. He had gone too far; he knew that. It had felt good, for a little while, and nothing could convince him that Severus hadn\u2019t deserved it. But now James was looking at him oddly, and he knew that Dumbledore would find out somehow \u2013 if Lily didn\u2019t tell everyone as soon as she got back to the common room.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d James asked, carefully, \u201cDid you lose control of it? That was really strong magic.\u201d\n\u201cIt was amazing!\u201d Sirius said, suddenly, \u201cHe\u2019ll think twice about crossing us again!\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 I mean, we didn\u2019t want to\nhurt\nhim, did we?\u201d James frowned.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine, he was just pretending, to get us in trouble.\u201d\n\u201cWill we get in trouble?\u201d Peter asked, wringing his hands, \u201cWe didn\u2019t\nall\ndo it, did we? It was only\u2026\u201d\nSirius slapped him around the back of his head,\n\u201cYou rat.\u201d He said. \u201cWe\u2019re marauders. All for one and one for all.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever that means,\u201d Peter muttered, rubbing his head and going to sit on his own bed, sulkily.\n\u201cI did it, you lot shouldn\u2019t get in trouble.\u201d Remus said, quietly, not looking up.\n\u201cIt was half my idea!\u201d Sirius said, \u201c\nI\ndid the research! Don\u2019t worry, Lupin, I bet you anything he\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cIf he is,\u201d Remus said, heavily, \u201cThen it\u2019s no thanks to me.\u201d He finally met James eyes. They were deep brown, and much more serious than usual. \u201cI did mean to hurt him.\u201d\nJames held his gaze, and nodded slightly.\nThere was a knock at the door, diffusing the tension. It was Frank Longbotttom.\n\u201cYou four are to come to McGonagall\u2019s office, now.\u201d He said, gravely.\nThey followed Frank down the stairs and through the common room, where everyone stared at them. Remus looked at his feet the whole time, but he heard the chatter go quiet as they walked through. It didn\u2019t matter what happened next \u2013 everyone would know they were responsible.\nMcGonagall was not alone. Dumbledore stood beside her desk, his hands folded in front of him. He smiled pleasantly at the four boys who stood in a line before him.\n\u201cGood evening, gentlemen.\u201d He said.\n\u201cGood evening, headmaster,\u201d they all chanted back.\n\u201cYou may be interested to know that young Mr Snape is quite well \u2013 though his pride has been rather wounded.\u201d\nThey said nothing. Remus didn\u2019t look up.\n\u201cHe seemed to think that you four had something to do with his misfortune.\u201d Dumbledore continued, pleasantly, as if he was just passing the time of day. \u201cParticularly you, Mr Potter.\u201d\nJames looked up, opened his mouth, then closed it again and looked down. Remus couldn\u2019t bear it. He only had three friends in all the world, and he wasn\u2019t going to lose them now. He stepped forward.\n\u201cIt was me, sir, I did it. He said some stuff to me earlier, and I was pissed off with him. I wanted to teach him a lesson.\u201d He forced himself to look up, into Dumbledore\u2019s pale blue eyes. The old man nodded, satisfied.\n\u201cI see. You acted alone?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Remus pulled out his wand, \u201cLook, I can prove it\u2014\u201c\n\u201cNo need!\u201d Dumbledore said, hurriedly, \u201cI believe you, Mr Lupin.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just him, sir!\u201d Sirius burst out, \u201cI looked up the spell, I learnt how to do it too, it\u2019s just as much my fault.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean you planned this, Black?\u201d McGonagall said, sharply, \u201cYou planned an attack on another pupil? Ten points from Gryffindor. Each.\u201d\nSirius looked down again.\n\u201cAnd detention for all of you, for a month.\u201d She continued, \u201cI find it very hard to believe that Mr Lupin here acted alone.\u201d\nAll four of them hung their heads.\n\u201cYou may go, gentlemen.\u201d Dumbledore said, quietly. \u201cI have no doubt you will all take the time to apologise to Mr Snape, of course.\u201d\nSirius made an indignant noise, and James elbowed him roughly. They turned to leave.\n\u201cMr Lupin, just a moment,\u201d\nRemus froze. He should have known he wouldn\u2019t get away with it that easily. He stood still as the others left the room, McGonagall following them out to make sure they didn\u2019t loiter outside.\nOnce the door closed, a still silence fell. Dumbledore didn\u2019t speak immediately, and finally Remus raised his head to meet the headmaster\u2019s eyes. He didn\u2019t look angry, or disappointed. He wore his usual pleasant expression \u2013 tinged with curiosity, perhaps.\n\u201cHow have you been finding Hogwarts, Remus?\u201d\nThat wasn\u2019t the question he had anticipated.\n\u201cEr\u2026 ok, I s\u2019pose?\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to have had no problem making friends.\u201d\nThat wasn\u2019t a question at all, so he didn\u2019t answer it. He looked at his feet, then back up.\n\u201cAm I getting expelled?\u201d He asked. Dumbledore smiled,\n\u201cNo, Remus, no one is getting expelled. I can see that you\u2019re sorry for what you\u2019ve done. The thing that concerns me, is how you did it. That was a very strong spell, I wouldn\u2019t have expected a first year to... you must have been very angry.\u201d\nRemus nodded. He didn\u2019t want to tell Dumbledore why \u2013 about the names Snape called him, or how he made him feel stupid and worthless and small.\n\u201cPassion is an important quality in a wizard, Remus.\u201d Dumbledore was saying, \u201cIt directs our magic, strengthens it. But as you learnt today, if we do not exercise control then we endanger everyone around us.\u201d He looked very serious, his eyes had lost their twinkle. \u201cI do not wish to frighten you, Remus. When we first met, I told you that I sympathised with you \u2013 the hand you have been dealt is not one I would wish on anyone. But you\nmust\nbe more careful. You are a gifted wizard, do not waste it.\u201d\nRemus nodded, wanting more than anything for the conversation to be over. He\u2019d rather have the cane than a lecture. The worst part was that Dumbledore was right. He had let his anger towards Severus influence the spell he\u2019d used \u2013 he just wasn\u2019t used to having that kind of strength.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, professor.\u201d He said, \u201cIs Sniv\u2014I mean, is Severus ok?\u201d\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s perfectly fine. I think he was hoping that if he simply stopped struggling then whoever was casting the spell would stop. He\u2019s been dried off and won\u2019t suffer any long-term effects.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Remus nodded, \u201cGood.\u201d\n\u201cNow,\u201d Dumbledore smiled, \u201cOff you go. I\u2019ve kept you long enough and I have a feeling that Mr Potter is waiting outside for you to tell him everything.\u201d\n* * *\nDumbledore had given him a lot to think about. And he had plenty of time to think \u2013 McGonagall was deadly serious about their detentions, and even went so far as to split the four of them up. Sirius was tasked with scrubbing cauldrons in the dungeons, Peter with polishing the trophies in the awards room, and James with re-configuring every astronomy telescope in the tower. Remus was given the worst task of all; mucking out the owlery. Of course, none of them were permitted to use their wands and every night they had to begin all over again.\n\u201cCruel and unusual is what it is,\u201d Peter complained at the end of the first week as they fell into bed, filthy and exhausted.\n\u201cDunno what you\u2019re moaning about,\u201d Sirius grumbled, \u201cI\u2019d love to polish trophies. Who knows what I\u2019ve caught scraping out crusty potions from the bottoms of those bloody cauldrons.\u201d\nJames just groaned, removing his glasses and rubbing his eyes.\nRemus did not complain, because he didn\u2019t feel he deserved to. He felt terrible for getting all of his friends into trouble, but even more terrible for what he had done. This was only exacerbated by the amount of reading he had been doing. Sirius\u2019 spell was difficult, less intuitive than the magic he was used to. Sirius was the first to admit it wasn\u2019t perfect \u2013 it wore off after an hour or so and had to be repeated. Remus had just about mastered it enough to perform alone, though it often took him a few go\u2019s before he got it right.\nThe very first thing he had done was visit the library and borrowed a book from the magical creatures\u2019 shelves.\nEvery night, after they had done their homework and served their detentions, Remus would draw the curtains around his bed, light his wand, and read the same chapter over and over. There were entire books written on his particular problem, he had found, but he was terrified that someone would become suspicious if he started checking them all out. Plus, he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to know any more. The things he\u2019d read so far were bad enough.\nHe thought about the book almost constantly \u2013 in his lessons, at meal times, during detention. Words like \u2018monstrous\u2019, \u2018deadly\u2019, and \u2018darkest of creatures\u2019 flashed in his mind like neon signs. He\u2019d known that he was dangerous, of course. He\u2019d known that he was different. He\nhadn\u2019t\nknown that he was hated. Hunted, even. Apparently, his teeth were worth thousands in certain parts of eastern Europe. His pelt was worth even more.\nThere were legislative details too \u2013 things he didn\u2019t fully understand, but which sounded horrible. Employment laws and registries and travel restrictions. It seemed that even if he could read that his job prospects might be no better in the wizarding world than they were as a muggle. He also understood why Dumbledore had told him to be careful. It was clear now that if anyone at Hogwarts found out what Remus was, then he might be in real trouble \u2013 and expulsion would be the least of his concerns.\nFrustratingly, nothing he read was really relevant to his experiences. There was no account of a wizard actually living with the condition; how they had managed; what to expect; whether they had been able to hold down a job, or even just avoid hurting others. He\u2019d assumed it was normal that he could smell blood and hear heartbeats \u2013 but how could he know for sure? Was it normal that his magic was stronger when the moon was rising? Sometimes he thought he could feel the sheer power of it, fizzing in his veins like a potion; filling him up and spilling over, bursting from his fingertips. And then there was his temper. How much of that was him, and how much of it was the monster?\nHe lay awake most nights, after the reading spell had worn off and he was too tired to cast it again but too restless to sleep. His mind whirred with worry and fear. How simple everything had seemed back at St Edmund\u2019s. No magic, no homework, no agonising moral dilemmas. And, of course, no friends. If anything stopped Remus from just giving up, then it was that.\nIt was James, who had an ego the size of the lake, but a heart to match it. Peter \u2013 who, yes, granted was weird and a bit clueless \u2013 actually had a wicked sense of humour and could be unfailing generous. And of course Sirius. Sirius could keep secrets, had a mean streak but never directed it at his friends, was the most gifted student in the year but spent all his time coming up with pranks instead.\nRemus wasn\u2019t going to give up any of that, not if he could help it. Even if he had to be the swottiest student in the school; if he had to force himself to read every book, complete every assignment, follow every rule. He\u2019d be so good they wouldn\u2019t know what hit them. So good they\u2019d have to make him a prefect \u2013 he\u2019d do it all, if it meant staying at Hogwarts and keeping his friends.\nThere was nobody to talk to about any of these things. Nobody who would understand, anyway. As far as Remus knew, only Dumbledore, McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey knew about his condition. McGonagall was too severe to approach with questions like that. Remus still wasn\u2019t sure that Dumbledore was entirely sane, and anyway he had no idea how to make an appointment with the headmaster. So it had to be Madam Pomfrey, in the end.\nHe waited until the next moon, which came at the end of January. It was a Sunday, so after dinner he separated himself from the marauders and headed to the hospital wing earlier than usual.\n\u201cRemus!\u201d The nurse smiled at him, surprised, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you until nightfall.\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to ask you some stuff,\u201d He said, shyly, eyes darting around the room. There were a few students lying in beds, most of them sleeping. Fortunately Madam Pomfrey was very discrete.\n\u201cCertainly, shall we pop into my office?\u201d\nIt was much nicer than any of the teacher\u2019s offices Remus had been in so far. The walls were lined with hundreds of neat and orderly bottles of potions and tonics, it was light and airy, she didn\u2019t have a desk and instead of wooden seats there were comfortable armchairs seated either side of a fireplace.\n\u201cHow can I help, dear?\u201d She asked, settling in, gesturing that he sit down.\n\u201cWell,\u201d He swallowed, not sure how to begin, \u201cI just\u2026 I had a few questions about my\u2026 my problem.\u201d\nShe smiled at him, kindly,\n\u201cOf course you do, Remus, that\u2019s perfectly natural. Is there something specific you would like to know?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I did a bit of reading, I know there isn\u2019t a cure or anything.\u201d\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d She said, quickly, \u201cAdvancements are being made all the time.\u201d\n\u201cOh, ok. But, for now, I suppose I just want to know\u2026 more about it. I don\u2019t remember anything when I wake up, just that I get really hungry.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d like to know more about the transformation?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not just that. Stuff like\u2026 does it change who I am, the rest of the time? Does it make me\u2026\u201d He looked down at his hands, at a loss. He wasn\u2019t sure what he wanted to say, and there was a hard lump in his throat.\n\u201cRemus,\u201d Madam Pomfrey said, \u201cThis is a condition you have, it isn\u2019t who you are.\u201d\n\u201cI get angry, sometimes,\u201d He said, staring into the fire rather than looking her in the face, \u201cI get really, really angry.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone has emotions, they\u2019re perfectly natural. We just learn to control them, over time.\u201d\nHe nodded, taking this in. He couldn\u2019t tell her the rest -\u201cWhen I change, it\u2019s getting worse. Harder.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d She replied, solemnly, \u201cI did read that it can get worse with the onset of puberty.\u201d\n\u201cOh, ok.\u201d Remus nodded. There was a long pause. \u201cHow much worse?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 I couldn\u2019t say. You really are the first of your kind that I\u2019ve treated.\u201d\nAnother silence. Remus felt no better than he had before; no less confused.\n\u201cWould you like to borrow that book I mentioned?\u201d\nHe nodded, finally bringing himself to look up at her.\n* * *\nMadam Pomfrey\u2019s book,\nFur to Fangs:\n\nCaring for Magical Half-Humans\nwas moderately more helpful than some of the others Remus had read so far. There was still a lot he couldn\u2019t understand \u2013 advanced healing magic and complicated potion recipes, more details on legislation \u2013 and even more terrifying; trials and persecution. Conversely, there was a lot he already knew; he had been bitten, and mustn\u2019t be allowed to bite anyone else during a full moon; silver hurt him; there was no cure.\nThe book did indeed say that with the onset of puberty his transformations would increase in intensity, and that he would become more dangerous afterwards. It did not mention changes in abilities, magical or otherwise, and there was nothing solid referring to changes in mood or temper.\nHe didn\u2019t consider it particularly interesting or important to know that he had a shorter snout than real wolves or that his tail tufted (he\u2019d rather not think about having either), but he was curious to discover that he was only a threat to humans \u2013 particularly wizards. Apparently other animals were in no danger from him \u2013 he amused himself thinking that Mrs Norris was safe, at least.\nIt did not go unnoticed that Remus had withdrawn from the marauders since the attack on Snape.\n\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d They\u2019d ask, every evening as they all dressed for bed.\n\u201cHomework,\u201d he\u2019d shrug, or sometimes \u201cDetention,\u201d \u2013 though he hadn\u2019t had another detention since the prank.\nThe truth was, he was always as far away from other people as he could get. He deliberately tried to stay out of their room until it was time to sleep, and even avoided the common room if he could help it. He felt that until he could control his magic, he\u2019d better not get involved in any more of James and Sirius\u2019 schemes. And they\nwere\nscheming, he knew that for sure. Sometimes at night Remus could hear them sneaking into each other\u2019s beds, then whispering furtively before casting a silencing charm. Other times they crept out with Peter, under the cloak. They always tried to wake Remus, but he ignored them.\nDuring the day he hid away at the back of the library, or else in one of his secret places. \u00a0He\u2019d found places all over the castle that were small enough to climb inside and go undiscovered for hours at a time. Windows that had been long bricked over, but retained high, broad ledges; small, empty chambers like priest holes concealed behind tapestries; the fifth-floor girls\u2019 bathroom. There he could curl up and read for hours \u2013 sometimes he actually did his homework, other times he forced himself to research his condition.\nHe had another reason to hide. Since the incident, Snape\u2019s hatred towards the marauders had intensified, and he went everywhere with Mulciber, using him as personal protection. If they crossed paths in the hallways Remus always had to be ready with a shielding charm \u2013 Mulciber knew more hexes than Sirius and James combined.\nOne afternoon, Remus was deep into a book on ancient battle magic \u2013 there was a chapter in it on the\n\u00dalfh\u00e9\u00f0nar\n, Germanic wolf-warriors who fought the Romans. He was sitting high up on his favourite on his window ledge and couldn\u2019t be seen from the floor unless someone was really looking. He\u2019d climbed up using a rope charm they\u2019d learnt a few weeks ago. He was just about to climb down and go for dinner, when he made a wrong move and knocked the heavy book off the ledge. He winced as it plummeted to the hard stone floor with a deafening thud.\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?!\u201d A voice came, further up the corridor. He heard footsteps, and with a sinking feeling Remus realised he knew who it was.\n\u201cS\u2019just a book.\u201d Mulciber said, sounding sullen.\n\u201cYes, but where did it come from?\u201d Snape replied, suspicious. Mulciber huffed,\n\u201cThe library?\u201d\nSnape muttered under his breath, sounding exasperated. Remus pressed as hard as he could against the stone wall.\n\u201cWho\u2019s up there?\u201d Snape called in his nasal, spiteful voice. Silence. \u201c\nHomenum Reveli\no.\u201d\nRemus felt an odd tugging sensation in his stomach and before he knew it, was being pulled from the ledge by an unseen force. He yelped, scrambling for something to hold onto, and ended up dangling from the ledge by his fingertips.\nSnape and Mulciber were laughing below.\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d Snape purred, \u201cIf it isn\u2019t\nLoony Lupin\n\u2026 where are your little friends, eh? Put you up there and forgotten about you?\u201d\n\u201cPiss off, Snape.\u201d Remus hissed, losing purchase on the stone, hoping he wouldn\u2019t break his ankles when he finally dropped.\n\u201c\nIgniscopum\n!\u201d Snape smirked, pointing his wand. A thin rope of fire shot towards Remus, forcing him to kick off from the wall, landing on his back on the floor, hard.\nHe blinked, winded, but quickly climbed to his feet, withdrawing his own wand,\n\u201cOk,\u201d he said, his back sore from the fall, \u201cYou got me. Now go away.\u201d\n\u201cWhy on earth would we do that?\u201d Severus replied, facing him off, raising his wand,\n\u201c\nExpeli\n-\u201c\n\u201c\nEXPELLIARMUS\n\u201d Snape roared, beating him to it. He clutched Remus\u2019 wand, gleefully, then added, \u201c\nGelesco\n.\u201d\nRemus felt his feet fuse with the ground, sticking him in place. He groaned \u2013 he was stuck now. It might be worth calling for help, but the corridor was a quiet one, and he didn\u2019t want to look like a coward. He stared at them both, defiantly, setting his jaw.\n\u201cMulciber,\u201d Snape turned to his troll-like companion, \u201cWeren\u2019t we just saying the other day, that you need to practice a few hexes more? I feel like this might be the perfect opportunity.\u201d\nMulciber grinned, licking his lips. He raised his own wand, not quite as elegantly as Severus, but with the same malicious intent.\n\u201c\nLapidosus\n!\u201d\nNothing happened for a moment, and Remus felt a surge of relief \u2013 before suddenly, out of nowhere, a cloud of tiny stones \u2013 like gravel \u2013 appeared floating in mid-air. It hovered between Remus and Mulciber for a few moments, before beginning to fly at Remus\u2019s face, like a swam of angry bees. He immediately raised his arms to protect himself, but Severas was too quick;\n\u201c\nIncarcerous\n,\u201d he said, yawning as if bored. Immediately Remus found himself bound tightly by rope, now hardly able to move at all. The stones kept pelting themselves at him and all he could do was shut his eyes. He struggled, knowing it wouldn\u2019t help, but needing to do\nsomething\n. He didn\u2019t want to cry, even when he felt a hot trickle of blood slide down his temple.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on \u2013 Severus?\u201d A girl\u2019s voice came from the end of the hall.\n\u201c\nFinite Incantatum\n,\u201d Snape whispered, hurriedly. The stones stopped at once, the rope vanished, and Remus\u2019 legs came unstuck, all at one. He wobbled and staggered backwards, leaning against the wall.\nHe looked up in time to see Lily, his saviour, hurrying towards them. She stopped when she saw Remus, who was quickly trying to wipe the blood from his face. She looked at Snape and frowned,\n\u201cWhat are you doing, Sev?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he looked at the ground, scuffing the toe of his shoe on the flagstones. \u201cJust chatting to Lupin, weren\u2019t we Mulciber?\u201d\nMulciber shrugged, unconvincingly. Lily looked at Remus, who looked away, embarrassed. Bad enough to be caught by Severus, he didn\u2019t need her feeling sorry for him too. He snatched his wand from Severus quickly, turned and started walking away as fast as he could.\n\u201cWait! Remus!\u201d Lily ran after him. He didn\u2019t stop for her, but she was quick on her feet, and caught him up. She was clutching his battle magic book in one arm, and grabbed hold of him with the other, \u201cPlease!\u201d She huffed. He stopped, sighing heavily \u2013 he wanted his book back.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He scowled.\n\u201cWhat were they doing to you? Sev won\u2019t tell me, and I know it was bad.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Remus shrugged, taking his book.\n\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding!\u201d\n\u201cLeave off, Evans,\u201d Remus pushed her away, trying to leave again. She kept hurrying alongside him.\n\u201cI told him to stop picking on you, I don\u2019t know why he does it \u2013 I mean, you don\u2019t even go around with Potter and Black anymore, I told him that\u2014\u201c\n\u201cWhy would that matter?!\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re the ones he really wants to annoy \u2013 if he knows that you\u2019ve got sick of them too, then\u2014\u201c\n\u201cWait.\u201d Remus stopped still, Lily nearly collided into him. \u201cAre you saying that you\u2019d be ok with it if Mulciber and Snape was cursing James and Sirius instead of me?!\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Lily flushed, \u201cI mean, it would be a fair fight at least. And, you know, they do bring it on themselves, acting the way they do.\u201d\nRemus felt even more uncomfortable now. She thought that James and Sirius had attacked Severus both times \u2013 she had no idea it was him at all. This confirmed one of his worst fears \u2013 Lily thought that Remus only hung around with James and Sirius because he was odd, and because they let him. Did everyone in the castle think he was as pathetic as Peter?\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d Remus frowned. \u201cNow leave me alone, will you?\u201d"

            "content": "\u201cGreat to have you back, Lupin.\u201d Sirius grinned, pulling back the invisibility cloak as they entered the (previously locked) Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom.\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d Remus replied, watching James climb the ladder in the corner of the room to reach the highest shelf, where stood a cage of sleeping pixies. \u201cI haven\u2019t been anywhere.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, mate,\u201d Peter said, holding the ladder for James, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t escaped our notice that you\u2019ve been avoiding us like the plague.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d Remus twisted his mouth, \u201cJust been busy. You know, studying and stuff.\u201d\n\u201cWell I hope you\u2019re over that phase now,\u201d James laughed, slowly climbing down, clutching the huge cage in both hands, \u201cI\u2019d really appreciate it if you stopped working so hard \u2013 it makes\nme\nhave to work hard, you see, and I\u2019m not used to the competition.\u201d\n\u201cOh, do one, Potter.\u201d Sirius snarled, rummaging through drawers and inside desks.\nRemus had decided that this prank wouldn\u2019t be too bad \u2013 it didn\u2019t require him to use any magic, anyway. If he was completely honest with himself, he had really missed all of their mischief. Being a swot was all well and good, but it wasn\u2019t half\nboring\n. No wonder Evans was always frowning.\n\u201cHow are we going to get them into the dining hall?\u201d He asked, bending down to gaze at the tiny blue creatures, still sleeping, curled up at the bottom of the cage. There must have been about fifty of them, which Remus felt was rather cruel. Much better to liberate them.\n\u201cUnder the cloak,\u201d James replied, spreading it wide now so that they could all get under, \u201cCome\non\nSirius,\u201d he rolled his eyes at the long-haired boy who was now on his hands and knees under the teacher\u2019s desk.\n\u201cWhat are you even looking for?\u201d Peter asked, muffled under the cloak.\n\u201cOne of the Ravenclaws told me there was a trap door under here.\u201d Sirius sighed, getting up and dusting off his knees. \u201cLiar.\u201d\n\u201cThis is Black\u2019s newest obsession,\u201d James explained to Remus as he closed the cloak over them and they headed for the door, \u201cFinding secret doors.\u201d\n\u201c\nHogwarts: A History\nsays there are loads of undiscovered passages!\u201d Sirius said, defensively. \u201cLike that one you found, Lupin. There are definitely more, I want to find at least one before we leave.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s also supposed to be a monster hidden somewhere in the castle.\u201d James whispered back, as they made their way along the halls towards Gryffindor tower. Peter shuddered.\n\u201cA risk I\u2019m willing to accept,\u201d Sirius replied, and Remus could hear the grin in his voice, \u201cMy legacy is much more important.\u201d\n\u201cTypical,\u201d James laughed.\n* * *\nThe next evening at dinner, James was grinning like a maniac, trying to look like he wasn\u2019t hiding fifty sleeping pixies underneath the table and failing miserably. Peter, who was good at Astronomy, was busy checking over the other marauders\u2019 homework, which was to label every star on their chart.\n\u201cHonestly,\u201d Peter groaned, scribbling something out on Sirius\u2019, \u201cYou\u2019d think you\u2019d get your\nown\nbloody star right\u2026\u201d\nSirius laughed,\n\u201cWhat can I say, I\u2019m hopeless.\u201d\n\u201cYou have your own star?\u201d Remus frowned, once again finding himself on the back foot. He never paid any attention in Astronomy \u2013 he knew the phases of the moon and that was plenty.\n\u201c\u2019Sirius.\u2019\u201d Peter replied, \u201cCome on, Lupin, we\u2019ve done this. It\u2019s the brightest star in the sky? The dog star?\u201d He sighed, looking at Remus\u2019 work now, \u201cYep, you\u2019ve missed it too.\u201d He groaned.\nRemus shrugged,\n\u201cI just thought it was his name.\u201d\n\u201cThe Noble and most Ancient House of Black has always been a bit arsey with its naming conventions,\u201d Sirius mused, \u201cHalf of us have astronomical names \u2013 there\u2019s Bellatrix, of course; my dad\u2019s Orion, my brother\u2019s Regulus\u2026 Mum isn\u2019t a star, I think she\u2019s an asteroid \u2013 pretty apt, if you\u2019ve ever seen her in a bad mood. Then there\u2019s good old uncle Alphard, uncle Cygnus\u2026 Andromeda\u2019s named after a whole galaxy.\u201d\n\u201cWizards are\nso weird\n.\u201d Remus sighed.\n\u201cRemus,\u201d James sniggered, \u201cYou do know that\nLupis\nis a constellation too, don\u2019t you? The wolf.\u201d\n\u201cThe what?!\u201d Remus felt his heart skip a beat and he nearly choked on his dinner. Sirius slapped him hard on the back, deftly changing the subject;\n\u201cIf you\u2019re nearly finished telling us all how stupid we are, Pete, can we get on with releasing the you-know-what\u2019s? My lovely cousins have just started eating, I\u2019d call that perfect timing\u2026\u201d\nIt really was perfect. James gave the cage a sharp kick to wake up the pixies before sweeping away the cloak and whispering a quick unlocking charm on the cage. There was an explosion of noise and colour and chaos.\nRemus hadn\u2019t really known what to expect from the pixies \u2013 they\u2019d seemed perfectly harmless all night and day while they\u2019d been locked up sleeping under James\u2019 bed.\nBut now he could see exactly why Sirius and James had been so excited. As they burst out from under the table, the tiny creatures scattered in all directions, chattering in high pitched gibberish and zooming back and forth across the great hall. They leapt into plates of mashed potato, squealing with delight, they grabbed plates and cutlery out of students\u2019 hands and flung them across the room; they pulled ponytails and tore at parchment.\n\u201cQuick!\u201d James ducked under the table, where they all crouched under the invisibility cloak, watching the anarchy unravel around them.\n\u201cBrilliant!\u201d Sirius kept saying, \u201cBrilliant, brilliant, brilliant!\u201d\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Remus said, nudging the other boys forward. Their plan had been to observe for a while, then sneak out of the hall as quickly as possible without getting caught.\nAll four of them awkwardly navigated their way out from under the table \u2013 which was made especially difficult by several other students attempting to dive for cover. Fortunately, pixies couldn\u2019t see through invisibility cloaks, and they were left alone.\nIn the uproar, no one else noticed them either. Girls were screaming, boys shouting, everyone was trying to cover their heads to protect themselves from dive-bombing pixies, or else struggling to grab back their stolen items.\n\u201cOH YES!\u201d Sirius suddenly gasped, bursting into fitful laughter.\nRemus turned and saw Bellatrix, screaming at the top of her lungs, her wild hair being yanked from side to side by the tiny blue pests, another flutting above her had caught her wand and was waving it at her, zapping blue lightening.\n\u201cGet off me! You filthy\u2014you disgusting\u2014you\u2014Aaargh!\u201d She wailed. Narcissa was cowering under the table, clutching her own wand tightly.\nThings escalated even further as Peeves the Poltergeist entered the room, zipping about gleefully and causing just as much havoc. He seemed to be directing the pixies, lifting tablecloths and screeching,\n\u201cUnder here, piskies! Lots of ickle-firsties down here!\u201d\nStifling laughter, the marauders fled from the room when they heard McGonagall\u2019s shrill voice ringing out,\n\u201c\nPetrificus Totallus\n!\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s definitely going to know it was us.\u201d Peter wheezed, as they made their way back to the tower, still under the cloak.\n\u201cNah,\u201d James replied, casually, \u201cI bet she blames it on the Prewetts, they always do big stuff like that. Something to aspire to.\u201d\n* * *\n\u201cPlease.\u201d Sirius said.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Replied Remus.\n\u201cPleeeeease!\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cIt would just feel\u2026 weird! I don\u2019t want you to.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019ll be fun! I\npromise\nyou\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d\n\u201cHa.\u201d\nThe conversation had carried on in much the same way for about three corridors now. Remus ended up trying to hurry ahead, and heard James chastise Sirius behind him.\n\u201cLeave Lupin alone, will you?\u201d\n\u201cI will not! This is too important!\u201d Sirius was in a restless mood, which tended to make him extra obnoxious \u2013 usually James was the only one who put up with him.\nThey\u2019d had a long afternoon in the library, completing zodiac charts for their Astronomy revision. Exams were still months away, but James insisted on having a head start. Of course, Sirius had to compete, and Peter had to go anywhere James went. Remus didn\u2019t want to be left out. They had been musing over their star signs, when it had come up that Remus was a Pisces. Sirius had quickly deduced that this meant his birthday was coming up. And so the pleading had begun.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously not that important to Remus,\u201d James hissed at Sirius, \u201cDo something for\nmy\nbirthday, if you have to, it\u2019s not long after.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get your turn,\u201d Sirius dismissed him.\u00a0 \u201cBut first \u2013 Lupin.\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t care, Sirius,\u201d Remus sighed, as they reached the portrait of the fat lady. \u201cDon\u2019t make a fuss.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s your birthday!\u201d Sirius replied, earnestly, \u201cWe\nshould\nmake a fuss.\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t see why. No one had ever made a fuss before. There was cake, of course, but sharing a cake with fifty other boys didn\u2019t leave much. Plus all of the little kids insisted on getting a turn to blow out the candles too, so it took forever. Matron wrapped up a few gifts, but they were usually practical \u2013 new clothes, socks, underwear, pens and notebooks. Other than that, there was nothing special about the day at all. He was actually looking forward to being away from St. Edmund\u2019s, because he thought that Sirius, James and Peter were probably too well bred to know about the \u2018birthday bumps\u2019 \u2013 a punch in the arm for each year of age (and one for luck \u2013 usually the hardest).\n\u201cWhy does it matter so much?!\u201d Remus huffed, climbing through the portrait hole. He couldn\u2019t stand it when Sirius was like this \u2013 stubborn and persistent.\nBut when he turned around, he was surprised to see that Sirius was rubbing his arm, looking uncharacteristically hurt.\n\u201cYou lot all did stuff for my birthday and\u2026 well it was really nice. I never much looked forward to it before but\u2026 well, it was great, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\nRemus suddenly felt guilty. He realised that Sirius didn\u2019t just want to be the centre of attention again \u2013 he was trying to make Remus happy. As if that might make him happy too. Remus had never had much opportunity to give somebody what they really wanted. He relented.\n\u201cOh\u2026 ok, fine. But not a big party or anything, just marauders, right?\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Sirius grinned, at once his face was transformed, eyes twinkling like stars."

            "content": "Remus\u2019 twelfth birthday fell on a Friday that year. Usually on Fridays after lessons James would force them all to go and watch the Gryffindor quidditch practice, and Remus would read quietly to himself. Sirius, however, had managed to convince James that he could miss just one practice \u2013 especially as he wasn\u2019t even on the team yet \u2013 and that Remus might actually want to do something different on his birthday.\nHe was woken early in the morning by his three dorm mates piling onto his bed, all shouting, \u201cHappy Birthday, Lupin!\u201d They didn\u2019t try to punch him, which meant that the day was already off to a head start as his best birthday ever.\nAt breakfast, James and Sirius marched ahead, pushing other students out of the way as they approached their usual seats, loudly announcing,\n\u201cOut of the way, please!\u201d\n\u201cBirthday boy coming through!\u201d\n\u201cMove along, nothing to see here!\u201d\nRemus wanted to hide under the table by the time they\u2019d reached it. His three friends made a huge show of serving him his breakfast, rather than letting him get anything for himself. Peter poured his tea, James loaded up his plate while Sirius buttered his toast.\n\u201cDo you have to?\u201d Remus groaned, horribly embarrassed.\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d James said.\n\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Peter nodded,\n\u201cUnquestionably.\u201d Finished Sirius.\nRemus shook his head, blushing hard and looking down at his food. When he had finished \u2013 which took a while, because he had been served double portions of almost everything \u2013 they all stood up, still grinning widely at him.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d He asked, twitching nervously. If they\nwere\ngoing to do the birthday bumps, then he hoped it would be over with quickly. Perhaps there was a wizard version? He\u2019d missed Sirius\u2019 birthday after all, he didn\u2019t know what to expect. Peter and James each put a hand on his shoulder, forcing him to sit down again. Sirius pulled a pitch pipe from his robes pocket and blew a long note. Remus squeezed his eyes shut. Oh no\u2026\n\u201cHaaaaaaaaaahhh-ppy birthday to you!\u201d The three boys bellowed at the tops of their voices, \u201cHaaaah-ppy birthday to youuu! Haaaaah-ppy birthday dear Reeeeeeeeeee-mus!\u201d\nNow the rest of the hall joined in, and Remus covered his head with his hands,\n\u201cHaaaaah-ppy birthdaaaaay toooooo youuuuuu!\u201d\n\u201cHip hip!\u201d James yelled, standing on his chair,\n\u201cHooray!\u201d The Griffindors chorused back.\n\u201cAt least that\u2019s over and done with,\u201d Remus muttered, his face burning as they finished cheering. Peter looked at him with pity,\n\u201cSorry mate, but they\u2019re planning to do the same at lunch and dinner.\u201d\n* * *\nThey still had to sit through Potions as their last lesson of the week \u2013 Remus had found that even when he did all of his homework and understood all of the texts he still had no natural talent for potion making. On top of that, it was a boring subject, and Slughorn began to bang on about the five key components of sleeping draughts Remus began to doze off himself.\nSnape didn\u2019t bother him \u2013 actually, Snape hadn\u2019t so much as glanced in Remus\u2019 direction since the incident in the corridor. Lily flashed him a smile and wished him happy birthday, before rolling her huge emerald eyes as James and Sirius attempted to convince Slughorn not to give them any homework out of respect for the \u2018occasion\u2019.\nAt dinner Remus endured what he hoped was his final round of \u2018happy birthday\u2019, which became the loudest yet, largely because Dumbledore was present and began conducting the entire school, bellowing at the top of his own voice. He also received a few cards \u2013 one from the whole of Gryffindor house, another from Matron along with a new pair of socks.\nAfter dinner they sat in the common room and Sirius lugged down his heavy record player and put on\nElectric Warrior\nfor the hundredth time since Christmas.\n\n\u201cI was dancing when I was twelve\u2026\u201d\n\nAt some point, a cake was produced, with red and gold Gryffindor icing, and twelve pink candles. When Remus cut it open (all the while encouraged to make a wish, but not able to think of one single thing he wanted) he was amazed to find that it was made up of four different flavours \u2013 a quarter chocolate, a quarter lemon drizzle, a quarter Victoria sponge and a quarter coffee and walnut.\n\u201cLike your toast.\u201d Sirius grinned, looking thrilled at the expression of surprise on Remus\u2019 face, \u201cThought you might get bored if it was all one flavour.\u201d\n\u201cWow\u2026 thanks!\u201d\n\u201cSo what do you want to do for the rest of the evening?\u201d James asked, \u201cIt still looks light enough if you\ndid\nwant to go and watch the--\u201c\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t, James! Bloody hell, you\u2019re going to have to start developing some other interests, mate, you\u2019re getting boring.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind if you want to go and watch the quidditch practice.\u201d Remus said, hurriedly, \u201cYou\u2019ve already done plenty, honestly. Three songs in one day, what more could a twelve-year-old ask for?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d James shook his head heroically, \u201cSirius is right, it\u2019s your birthday, we\u2019ll do something you like doing.\u201d\nThey were all quiet for a little while, before James cleared his throat, \u201cErr, Lupin? What\ndo\nyou like doing?\u201d\nRemus thought. He could very easily give a list of things he did\nnot\nenjoy doing; football, homework, flying, potions. But no one had ever asked him before what sort of things he\ndid\nenjoy. He liked watching telly, but so far he hadn\u2019t discovered a TV at Hogwarts. He liked being able to choose what he ate for breakfast and dinner. He liked listening to Marc Bolan singing through Sirius\u2019 record player. None of these things were really hobbies.\n\u201cReading?\u201d Peter said, trying to be helpful, \u201cYou read a lot.\u201d\n\u201cDo I?!\u201d Remus raised his eyebrows. He hadn\u2019t thought about that, but it was true. Since Christmas, anyway, he\u2019d finished all his set texts for the year and even a few books checked out from the library.\n\u201cOh yeah, great,\u201d James rolled his eyes, \u201cHappy birthday, Lupin, let\u2019s start a book club.\u201d\nSirius sniggered. Pete looked annoyed,\n\u201cWell\nI\ndon\u2019t know! Other than reading, you seem to really like detention, Remus.\u201d\nRemus laughed at that, holding his hands up apologetically,\n\u201cSorry lads, I reckon I must just be really boring.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about when you disappear off?\u201d Sirius asked, suddenly. Remus balked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?! I told you, I\u2019ve been sick, I go to the hospital wing.\u201d He hurried.\nSirius waved a hand,\n\u201cNo, not then \u2013 sometimes you go off after lessons, or while we\u2019re watching the quidditch. What are you doing?\u201d\nRemus felt himself go red. He\u2019d been wandering off by himself less and less, but clearly his friends had still noticed. They all looked at him, expectantly. He bit his lip,\n\u201cI just sort of\u2026 walk around.\u201d He said, lamely.\n\u201cWhere, though?\u201d Peter asked, \u201cIn the grounds?\u201d\n\u201cEverywhere,\u201d Remus shrugged, \u201cI just like to look about. So I know where stuff is.\u201d He pulled the map out of his back pocket, \u201cIt\u2019s stupid, I started adding stuff to the map they gave us at the beginning of the year and whenever I see something interesting I put it in.\u201d\nJames took the map and unfolded it. The three boys peered over to see. They were quiet for a while. Sirius looked in awe,\n\u201cYou\u2019ve added all of the portraits\u2026 and labelled them and everything.\u201d\n\u201cMy spelling\u2019s rubbish,\u201d Remus blushed harder, wanting to snatch it back.\nJames\u2019 face was scrunched up.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d He pointed at a mark Remus had made on one of the staircases.\n\u201cOne of the trick steps,\u201d Remus replied, \u201cThat\u2019s the one you can sink into. That one,\u201d he pointed to a mark on a different step, \u201cis the one that vanishes. The staircases with arrows are the ones that move. I colour-coded so you can see where they end up.\u201d\n\u201cMerlin!\u201d Peter exhaled, \u201cD\u2019you have any idea how much time this would save me?! I swear I get trapped on the wrong corridor twice a week because of those flipping stairs.\u201d\n\u201cAnd me,\u201d James said.\n\u201cSod getting to lessons on time!\u201d Sirius burst out, \u201cPlease try to recognise the extremely important implications of this map. The possibilities now available to us for practical jokes.\u201d\nA smile spread across James\u2019 face, then Peter\u2019s. Remus snatched back the map, folding it up,\n\u201cIt\u2019s not finished yet. There\u2019s loads to do. I wanted to do some spells on it, once I figure out how.\u201d\n\u201cWhat sort of spells?\u201d Sirius asked eagerly.\nRemus hesitated. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t appreciate Sirius\u2019 interest, or his excitement \u2013 but Remus has really wanted to work the map out for himself, as silly as it sounded. After all, Sirius had come up with the reading spell, and the raincloud incantation. For reasons he couldn\u2019t quite explain, Remus had a strong desire to prove that he was just as clever \u2013 or just as able \u2013 to put in the legwork this time.\n\u201cJust some improvements,\u201d he said, cautiously. \u201cYou\u2019ll think it\u2019s silly.\u201d\n\u201cNo we won\u2019t,\u201d Peter replied, earnestly, \u201cWe can help!\u201d\n\u201cI s\u2019pose\u2026 it\u2019s my map, though.\u201d\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s yours,\u201d James smiled, soothingly, \u201cLike the cloak is mine, right? But in the service of mischief\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the marauder\u2019s.\u201d Sirius finished, his eyes twinkling.\n\u201cThe marauder\u2019s map.\u201d Remus repeated, still not one hundred percent comfortable with handing over his private project.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still\nyours\n, Lupin,\u201d Black continued, \u201cWe\u2019ll put your name first and everything!\u201d\n\u201cNot sure if we want our names on it\u2026\u201d Peter said, nervously.\n\u201cOur nicknames then.\u201d Sirius shrugged.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have nicknames.\u201d Remus replied, \u201cWell, I s\u2019pose I sort of do, but I really don\u2019t want \u2018Loony Lupin\u2019 written on it.\u201d\nThe other three burst out laughing. After that Remus decided that it wasn\u2019t so bad, letting them in on his secret. He was actually relieved; he\u2019d been starting to wonder if it wasn\u2019t just some private insanity of his \u2013 tracking and logging everything in the castle, getting it down, making sense of it. James, Sirius and Peter seemed less interested in the satisfaction of the task, and more keen on planning their next prank with it.\nThe rest of the evening was spent under the cloak, roaming the halls. The cloak, in Remus\u2019 opinion, was not strictly necessary, as they were all planning to be back before curfew. But James and Sirius never missed an opportunity to turn even the smallest trip into a full-scale mission, and Peter just enjoyed sneaking about unseen. All became clear, however, when Sirius produced five dung bombs, which they entertained themselves with en route; creeping up behind unsuspecting snogging couples, or dropping them into the pockets of older students hurrying to the library.\nRemus showed them what he\u2019d worked out so far, the passages and shortcuts he\u2019d discovered, and even a few of his hidden places (not all of them, of course, just in case). He even told them his plan to put some kind of tracking spell on Mrs Norris, Filch\u2019s cat, so that he\u2019d be able to see her coming. They loved that idea.\n\u201cWhy stop there?\u201d Sirius whispered, as they turned a corner back to the common room at the end of the night, \u201cWhy not track everyone?\u201d\n\u201cEveryone?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, then we\u2019d know when anyone was coming, we could get away with\nanything\n.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno.\u201d Remus replied, uncomfortable with the idea. What would happen when his friends saw him travelling down to the Whomping Willow every month? How long before they decided to follow him and got themselves killed? For the first time, Remus realised that the map was not as harmless as he\u2019d first thought.\nBut James and Peter were busy agreeing with Sirius, saying it was an excellent idea; already imagining being able to see what Dumbledore was up to, or where Snape was lurking. Remus firmly believed that given enough time, Sirius Black and James Potter truly could do anything they wanted \u2013 it was just who they were. He just hoped that it would be a long time yet."

            "content": "Time seemed to speed up after Remus\u2019 birthday. The days lengthened and spring rushed into the castle, flooding it with sunlight and fresh air after the long winter. Exams loomed, and Remus finally got over his anxiety around reading in public, spending more and more time in the library. Instead of planning new schemes and pranks, the marauders found their evenings devoted to practicing spells and quizzing each other on potion ingredients.\nSirius and James took the exams very seriously; it was a competition to them. Though they both would have denied vehemently, Remus suspected that they both had a desire to defend their pureblood honour \u2013 it was too ingrained as an attitude throughout the school, even amongst the teachers. It didn\u2019t bother Remus \u2013 even if he wasn\u2019t getting top marks in everything, he was still doing better than he ever had before. He was actually glad that he had no family to pressure him.\nThe pressure on Peter was all too evident. He wasn\u2019t a bad student by any means \u2013 in Herbology and Astronomy he even flourished, often beating James. But he was nervous, and it tended to affect his wand work, making his incantations sloppy. Peter didn\u2019t talk about his family very much, but he received a lot of letters from them, and Remus noticed that James was careful around the subject.\n\u201cHow much do we need to pass the year?\u201d The round face boy would ask desperately, at least four times a day.\n\u201cPeter, calm down,\u201d James would sooth, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine; you know all the theory backwards now, it\u2019s just putting it into practice.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame him for being a bit twitchy,\u201d Sirius whispered to Remus when the other two were out of earshot, \u201cThere\u2019ve been at least twelve squibs in the Pettigrew family \u2013 and that\u2019s just this century.\u201d\n\u201cSquibs?\u201d\n\u201cNon-magical wizards.\u201d Sirius explained, patiently, \u201cYou know how muggle families sometimes have magical kids? It works the other way too \u2013 no one likes to talk about it much. My great, great uncle actually had this mad theory that muggles were swapping their children with ours so that they could infiltrate the wizarding world. Completely bonkers, obviously.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Remus replied, hoping he sounded as if he understood everything Sirius had just said. \u201cSo that\u2019s why Peter\u2019s magic is a bit\u2026 wonky?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Sirius shrugged, \u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t know if they can actually\nprove\nthat squibbishness runs in families. But it\u2019s the reason the Pettigrews aren\u2019t in the sacred twenty-eight.\u201d\nRemus sighed heavily, fixing Sirius with his most withering look,\n\u201cYou\nknow\nI don\u2019t know what that is.\u201d\nSirius smirked,\n\u201cWell\nI\ndon\u2019t know, Lupin, what with all that reading you do these days. Nice to know there are some things I\u2019ve got over you.\u201d\nRemus snorted in reply, looking back at his work. Sirius carried on quickly, as if reluctant to lose the other boy\u2019s attention,\n\u201cThe sacred twenty-eight are the purest of the pure-bloods. The last remaining \u2018un-tainted\u2019 families.\u201d\nRemus gave Sirius another mean look. The dark-haired boy held his hands, up, hurrying to explain,\n\u201cTheir words, not mine! You know I don\u2019t believe any of that blood purity rubbish.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Remus raised an eyebrow. \u201cBet the Blacks are top of the list, though.\u201d\n\u201cActually,\u201d Sirius replied, eyes glittering with humour, \u201cThe Abbot\u2019s are first. It\u2019s alphabetical.\u201d\nRemus groaned and went back to his Potions revision.\n* * *\nExams were not at the top of Remus\u2019 list of things to worry about. He was relatively sure he would do ok \u2013 he\u2019d even checked the examination rules (which were five yards of parchment in length) and confirmed that use of the\nScriboclara\ncharm for tidying up handwriting was acceptable, as long at the student was able to perform the spell by themselves. Remus had been using the spell since November, and had no concerns.\nTwo things were worrying Remus far more than passing the year. First, there was the grim knowledge that he would have to return to St Edmund\u2019s in June. Though he had only been away for a few months, the difference between St Edmund\u2019s and Hogwarts seemed as vast as the difference between monochrome and technicolour. While other students cheerfully looked forward to a long, hot summer full of holidays abroad, relaxation and lie ins, Remus felt as though he was facing exile.\nThey weren\u2019t permitted to perform any magic outside of Hogwarts until they were seventeen, which meant that as well as losing contact with his friends, Remus would no longer be able to read. To him, summer stretched ahead, blank and desolated, punctuated by long angry nights locked away in his cell.\nAnd there was Remus\u2019 second problem, ready as always to rear its ugly, hairy snout. As Madam Pomfrey had predicted, since Remus had turned twelve his transformations had become much, much worse. There was no explanation for this in any of the books he read, other than some vague words about adolescence and puberty. Whereas before he might have come away with a few teeth and claw marks \u2013 the kind you\u2019d get from a playful puppy who meant no real harm \u2013 he now awoke with deep, furious gashes which bled copiously until Pomfrey arrived to staunch them. The agony of the transformation itself reached almost intolerable levels, and he often felt queasy for hours before the moon rose.\nTo make matters worse, Remus was spending longer stretches in the hospital wing, and it was getting harder and harder to explain away. His friends had started wondering aloud about what on earth could be ailing him \u2013 sometimes suggesting he was putting it on to get out of lessons, other times teasing him about being contagious.\nAt least back at St Edmund\u2019s he didn\u2019t have any friends who cared where he went every month.\nSirius clearly wasn\u2019t looking forward to the summer either. He grew uncharacteristically quiet whenever the upcoming holiday was mentioned, his eyes clouding over, the colour leaving his face. James invited all of them to stay at his for as long as they wanted \u2013 but Sirius remained pessimistic.\n\u201cYou know they\u2019ll never let me.\u201d He sighed.\n\u201cCheer up, mate,\u201d James slung an arm around his friend. They sat together on the big couch in the common room, Peter in arm armchair concentrating on turning a banana into a slipper. It wasn\u2019t working. Remus was lying on the rug in front of the fireplace, on his belly. He had a cut on his back that wasn\u2019t knitting together properly, even after Madam Pomfrey\u2019s ministrations, and had found that this was the only position which wasn\u2019t uncomfortable.\nSirius plainly didn\u2019t want to cheer up.\n\u201cThey won\u2019t though. Bellatrix\u2019s bloody wedding is in June, you can bet I\u2019ll have to be around for\nall\nof it.\u201d\n\u201cWe got an invite to that,\u201d Peter suddenly spoke, looking up from his slipper, which was still bright yellow and looked unpleasantly squishy. \u201cProbably see you there.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, great.\u201d Sirius huffed, exhaling hard so that his long hair fluffed up over his forehead. \u201cIf I haven\u2019t been turned into a newt. Or cursed into a portrait for the summer \u2013 they actually did that to Andromeda once. She\u2019s never been the same, hates wizard paintings now.\u201d\n\u201c\nAfter\nthe wedding,\u201d James said, tactfully trying to steer the conversation away from the Black family, \u201cThen we\u2019ll work something out. I\u2019ll break you out of there, if I have to, I swear.\u201d\nSirius grinned at James and James grinned back. Their body language mirrored perfectly and Remus felt a pang of loneliness. He knew that there was much more to Sirius\u2019 family problems than just him being the black sheep \u2013 there were the scars Sirius had shown him back in September, obviously, but as far as Remus knew, those were perfectly normal. Matron beat him if he acted up, and he\u2019d often got the cane from his muggle teachers \u2013 there was no reason for him to suspect that Sirius\u2019 home life was out of the ordinary.\nJames obviously knew a lot more about it. Remus could tell, because it was the one thing Potter never teased Sirius about \u2013 family. They talked a lot at night, the pair of them \u2013 Remus had heard Sirius crying more than once. It made him want to cast his own silencing spell; he hated the sound of tears, and rarely cried himself.\n\u201cYou too, Lupin,\u201d James was saying,\n\u201cHm?\u201d Remus lifted his head from his thoughts. He arched his back carefully and tried not to grimace when the pain split his back like a bolt of lightning.\n\u201cYou should come and stay over the summer. We\u2019ve got loads of room, and mum doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Remus shook his head, looking back down at his book. His back was on fire. \u201cMatron won\u2019t let me. Legal guardian stuff, muggle law.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be a way around it,\u201d James replied, confidently. \u201cBoth of you are coming, right? I\u2019m making it happen.\u201d\nRemus smiled, but knew there was nothing James could do. The full moons were due at the end of each month as they always were, and there wasn\u2019t enough of a window even for a week at the end of the summer. Besides, Matron really wouldn\u2019t let him.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve done it!\u201d Peter gasped, suddenly, holding his bright yellow slipper aloft.\n\u201cWell done, Pete,\u201d Sirius said, dully. \u201cTry it on to see if it fits.\u201d\nRemus sat up, his back now very painful indeed. As he straightened, he felt a warm slither of blood run down his spine and soak into the waistband of his trousers. Alarmed, he stood up, quickly.\n\u201cEurgh!\u201d Peter yelped, withdrawing his bare foot from the slipper, covered in sticky banana slime. James burst out laughing, his glasses falling askew,\n\u201cHe was\njoking\n, Pete! You\u2019ve got to stop doing stuff just because we tell you to.\u201d\n\u201cYou ok, Lupin?\u201d Sirius looked up, suddenly. Remus was dithering on the rug. He had to get to the hospital wing right away, but he had no idea how to explain himself.\n\u201cYeah, just\u2026 think I might go for a walk.\u201d\n\u201cWhere? It\u2019s almost curfew,\u201d Sirius\u2019 face lit up, \u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d\n\u201cNo no, nothing\u2026 I just fancied\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll come!\u201d James stood up too, \u201cI\u2019ll get the cloak.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Remus shouted.\nThey all froze, even Peter, who was halfway through picking banana strings from between his toes.\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Remus stammered, \u201cI don\u2019t feel well. I just want to go to Madam Pomfrey, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, mate,\u201d James held up his hands gently, \u201cCalm down. Want us to come with you anyway?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d Sirius said, quickly. He stood up and took Remus by the elbow, steering him towards the portrait hole before the other two could say anything.\n\u201cSirius\u2026\u201d Remus started, once they were out in the empty corridor,\n\u201cS\u2019all right, Lupin, I\u2019m just walking you there. Won\u2019t go in with you or anything.\u201d\nRemus looked at him, confused, then nodded and started walking, as quickly as his sore back would let him. He knew Sirius well enough now to know that there was no changing his mind. Peter might have let his nerves get the better of him and run back. James might have respected his wishes. But Sirius; Sirius always had to push it.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Sirius asked, eyeing him, \u201cYou\u2019re walking stiffly.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel well.\u201d Remus repeated, through gritted teeth. He hoped Sirius would just think he was angry with him, and not realise that he was actually biting back a growl of pain.\n\u201cOk.\u201d Sirius replied, smoothly. They continued walking in silence. When they finally reached the hospital wing, they stood outside awkwardly for a few minutes, Remus\u2019 hot amber eyes glaring into Sirius\u2019 cool blue stare as if daring him to ask a question.\n\u201cHope you feel better.\u201d Was all Sirius said. \u201cCan we come and visit you tomorrow, if you\u2019re not out?\u201d\n\u201cS\u2019pose so.\u201d Remus said, warily. He tried to shrug, then winced. Sirius\u2019 expression did not flicker.\n\u201cLook after yourself, Lupin.\u201d He said, quietly, before turning and hurrying back the way they\u2019d come.\nRemus watched him go, until he turned the corner. He had the strangest feeling that Sirius would glance back at him before disappearing. When he didn\u2019t, Remus couldn\u2019t help but feel strangely disappointed, though he ought to have known better \u2013 Sirius Black was never predictable.\nHe shivered, slightly \u2013 partly because of the mounting pain, and partly because of something else \u2013 then pushed open the hospital door."

            "content": "Remus would never tell anyone, but he really enjoyed the Hogwarts exam period. There were no lessons for a whole two weeks and while everyone else ran around like a headless chicken, Remus felt very relaxed about the whole thing.\nThe same could not be said for the rest of his classmates. Lily Evans had taken to ambushing other students in the library and common rooms, demanding that they quiz her on the 18\nth\nCentury Goblin Riots. Peter seemed to be constantly muttering to himself under his breath, wringing his hands together. Marlene McKinnon and Mary McDonald, two Gryffindor first years Remus usually tried to avoid, kept bursting into fits of hysterical giggles from the nerves. James and Sirius appeared to be acting out with more bravado than ever; setting off flameless firecrackers in the corridors and performing vanishing spells on unsuspecting student\u2019s book bags in the library. Remus couldn\u2019t tell if the two of them were just responding to the general atmosphere of anxiety, or whether they were expelling their own nervous energy.\nThe older students had no sympathy for their younger counterparts. Frank Longbottom gave out more detentions during the last week of term than he had all year, and even threatened to take fifty points from Gryffindor if James and Sirius didn\u2019t stop levitating inkwells in the common room. Remus felt that they had got off easy \u2013 Bellatrix Black actually cursed half of the Slytherins one evening for talking too loudly while she studied for her NEWT\u2019s. They couldn\u2019t speak for three days \u2013 Madam Pomfrey had to grow their tongues back.\nTheir first exam was Charms, which had Remus off to a good start. All they had to do was bewitch a coconut to dance an Irish jig, which he privately thought was very easy. He, James and Sirius managed without a problem, though Peter\u2019s coconut at first refused to move at all, then lost control once it finally got going and ended up spinning off the desk, smashing all over the flagstones.\nTransfiguration went almost as well, though it was a trickier subject. Their task was to turn a stag beetle into a pepper shaker \u2013 Sirius completed this in minutes, barely concealing his pride as McGonagall commented that it was the best example of small scale transfiguration she\u2019d ever seen from a first year. Remus\u2019 shaker wasn\u2019t too bad, though it was still shiny and black, whereas Sirius had somehow managed to make his glass. James attempted porcelain, and seemed to have done well until McGonagall tried to shake some pepper out of it and it spread its wings and flew out of the window, causing Marlene and Mary to shriek. Peter\u2019s pepper pot still had legs and antlers, even after an hour.\nHerbology and History of Magic were both written exams. Remus surprised himself by writing the longest history essay in the class \u2013 he had to ask Peter, sitting next to him, for extra parchment. Apparently there was plenty to be said about the goblin riots after all. Potions was easier than he expected \u2013 they had to brew a cure for warts from memory. Having a very good memory from years of practice, Remus knew he had all of the ingredients and quantities right, even if his preparation skills were lacking precision.\nBetween exams, Remus enjoyed his last weeks of freedom either wandering the halls and adding to his map (when he was alone) or eating ice cream outside by the lake (when the others were with him). He\u2019d recently found a corridor that smelled vaguely of chocolate, but couldn\u2019t work out what that meant \u2013 it was nowhere near the kitchens.\nThe days were much warmer now, and as June opened up and the testing came to a close, the marauder\u2019s minds turned to mischief.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be big.\u201d James said, decisively. He was always making unnecessary statements like that, waiting for someone else to come up with an idea for him to approve. \u201cOur last hurrah.\u201d\n\u201cNot our last,\u201d Sirius replied, picking at the grass. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back in two months.\u201d\n\u201cYou lot might be,\u201d Peter worried, \u201cI know I\u2019ve failed everything.\u201d\nJames waved a hand, dismissing Peter\u2019s fears. It was too warm and lazy of a day to spend long reassuring him. They were lounging in their new favourite spot, near a tree by the lake. Peter was sitting under the shade cast by the branches because he was fair and burnt easily. James and Sirius had stripped off their robes and rolled up the sleeves of their brilliant white uniform shirts to combat the heat. Remus simply lay in the sunshine, robes still on to cover up his freshest injuries, enjoying the warmth sinking into his aching joints. He liked the spot because the Whomping Willow was behind them, so they didn\u2019t have to look at it.\n\u201cHave we got any dung bombs left?\u201d Remus asked, squinting up at the blue sky, then closing his eyes to look at the patterns burned into his retinas.\n\u201cYeah, a few. Not enough for a big send off, though.\u201d\n\u201cHow big are you thinking, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cBigger than dung bombs.\u201d James replied, cleaning his glasses, as he often did when he was thinking. \u201cBig enough so that everyone knows it was us.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll know it\u2019s us. McGonagall always knows,\u201d Sirius put in, standing up and skimming a stone across the lake. It bounced five times \u2013 Sirius was amazing at skimming stones. He had this fluid sort of grace that was more animal than human. It drove Remus mad \u2013 after all,\nhe\nwas the one that wasn\u2019t strictly human, and he had all the natural grace of a flobberworm.\n\u201cThey might think it\u2019s the Prewetts.\u201d James shot back, \u201cThey\u2019ve been beating us all year.\u201d\n\u201cNothing beat the pixies!\u201d Sirius said, defensively. He threw another stone. This time, on its fourth bounce, a long, silvery tentacle rose from the water and batted it back towards him, lazily. Sirius grinned.\n\u201cAnd the itching powder was pretty good, you have to admit.\u201d Remus murmured, flinging an arm over his face.\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Sirius continued, enthusiastically, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give us points for ingenuity there.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the raincloud!\u201d Peter piped up, eager to be involved. They all fell quiet. Remus sat up. They hadn\u2019t talked about that incident at all since January. Peter gnawed his lip, realising what he\u2019d done.\nSirius shook his head, changing the subject,\n\u201cAnyway, the point is, the four of us have had more detentions than the rest of Gryffindor combined this year. What more do you want us to do, James? Sign our work?\u201d\nHe pulled back his arm to throw the stone back into the lake, but James leapt up and grabbed his shoulder, causing him to drop it.\n\u201cOi!\u201d Sirius frowned, annoyed, \u201cWhat are you playing at?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d James jumped, excitedly, \u201cWe\nsign our work\n!\u201d\n\u201cYou what?\u201d Remus squinted at both of them. He wished he hadn\u2019t stared at the sun for so long, his eyes were fogged over and he was starting to get a headache.\n\u201cSIGN OUR WORK.\u201d James repeated, as if he was making perfect sense and they were all too thick to get it. He sighed, impatient, \u201cWe put our mark on Hogwarts, literally.\u201d\n\u201cAre you talking about defacing school property, Potter?\u201d Sirius arched a dark eyebrow, joy written all over his face.\u201d\n\u201cI might just be, Black.\u201d James wiggled his own eyebrows in return \u2013 he couldn\u2019t raise just one, like Sirius could.\n\u201cWell, I say, old man.\u201d Sirius grinned, adopting an even more plummy, aristocratic accent than usual.\n\u201cWhat\ndo\nyou say, old bean?\u201d\n\u201cI say it\u2019s a simply ripping idea.\u201d\n\u201cOh, spiffing!\u201d\n\u201cGood show!\u201d\n\u201cRa\nthe\nr!\u201d\nThey both dissolved into giggles, falling on the ground and wrestling. Remus and Peter shared a look. This sort of thing was happening more and more; James and Sirius would get caught up in one of their own plays and leave the others behind. Remus stood and went over to sit with Peter.\n\u201cAny idea what they\u2019re on about?\u201d He asked the smaller boy. Peter was red in the face, his forehead creased. He was clearly thinking deeply.\n\u201cThey want us to write our names somewhere. On the walls?\u201d He said, slowly.\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Remus asked, \u201cLike\u2026 carve it into the stone or something? That\u2019s a bit permanent, innit?\u201d\nSirius and James continued wrestling. James was larger and usually had the upper hand, but Sirius fought dirty.\n\u201cS\u2019all I can think of,\u201d Peter shrugged. \u201cJames says he wants it big\u2026 the walls are the biggest\u2026 oh\u2026 OH!\u201d He jumped up, \u201cLads!\u201d He squeaked, \u201cI\u2019ve had an idea!\u201d\n\u201cBlimey!\u201d James and Sirius stopped at once. James had Sirius in a headlock, and Sirius\u2019 ankle was just inching around James\u2019, ready to yank and topple them both. \u201cAre you feeling ok, Pettigrew?\u201d\n\u201cThe lawn!\u201d Peter continued, pacing as he thought out loud, \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest canvas, and it wouldn\u2019t have to be permanent, it could be\u2026 if we used a quick-gro potion\u2026\u201d\nRemus sighed, deeply. Why wasn\u2019t anyone making any sense today?\n* * *\nAnd so it was down to James\u2019 desire for notoriety, and Peter\u2019s desperation to prove himself, that all four of them found themselves back out in the grounds after dark on the last day of term. They\u2019d had two weeks to plan it \u2013 hoarding supplies from the greenhouse and learning various colour changing incantations. In the meantime, they learnt that they had all passed their exams; even Peter. Remus had come first in History of Magic, and second in Charms (to Lily Evans, which he tried not to let bother him).\n\u201cOuch! That was my foot!\u201d\n\u201cSorry!\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t see a thing.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s dark out, idiot.\u201d\n\u201cOuch! That was\nmy\nfoot!\u201d\n\u201cCan we take the cloak off now?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I think so\u2026\u201d\nThey had dragged a heavy sack of hydrangea seeds all the way down from the tower. Well, Remus and Peter had. Sirius and James decided that they would lead the way.\n\u201cRight.\u201d James said, business-like, hands on his hips, \u201cDid we agree to write \u2018love\u2019, or \u2018from\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cFrom.\u201d Peter said.\n\u201cI prefer \u2018Love\u2019.\u201d Sirius said.\n\u201cAww, \u2018course you do, Black,\u201d James ruffled his hair playfully, causing Sirius to duck and pull a face. \u201cLove it is, then. C\u2019mon gentlemen, to work!\u201d\nAn hour later, the sack of seeds was empty, and Remus was following the trail the others had left, drizzling the \u2018quick-gro\u2019 potion over the ground.\n\u201cAre we sure we spelled everything right?\u201d James scratched his head, messing up his hair even more.\n\u201cToo late now,\u201d Sirius replied, wiping sweat from his brow. \u201cLook, we\u2019d better go, sun\u2019s coming up.\u201d He pointed to the sky, which was beginning to glow pink.\n\u201cThe colour changing spell, quick!\u201d\n\u201cI did it already,\u201d Remus said, finishing the last of the potion. \u201cWhile they were still in the bag.\u201d\n\u201cGood thinking, Lupin!\u201d Sirius slapped him on the shoulder, \u201cKnew you were the logical one.\u201d\nSince when?!\nRemus thought to himself.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not go in yet,\u201d James said, \u201cLook, we can watch the sun rise.\u201d\n\u201cMerlin,\u201d Sirius laughed, \u201cYou big poof.\u201d\nThey did watch, though, in awe as the glowing orange sun slowly climbed over the horizon, flooding the great lake with golden sparks, then paling as it rose higher into the parchment coloured sky.\n\u201cNext year\u2019ll be even better, lads,\u201d James grinned, his glasses reflecting the new sun as he threw an arm each around Peter and Sirius. Remus stood slightly off to the side, content just to stand with them.\nThey headed back to the castle in a strange mood, and almost forgot to put the cloak back on. They returned to Gryffindor tower, and James and Peter tried to sleep, but Remus couldn\u2019t. For one thing, Sirius had finally begun packing \u2013 he\u2019d been putting it off for a week now, and began throwing his things carelessly and noisily into his mahogany trunk. It was embossed with a serpent, like so many of Sirius\u2019 things.\nFor another thing, Remus didn\u2019t want to sleep. His last few hours at Hogwarts were draining away so quickly, and he didn\u2019t want to miss any of them. He sat on the windowsill and watched their prank developing in the grass below. The seeds were already taking root and growing very quickly, twisting and writhing below like something in a science fiction film.\n\u201cLooking good!\u201d Sirius said, coming over to look. He\u2019d apparently finished packing, though his trunk didn\u2019t look like it would close properly.\n\u201cStill think it should have been \u2018woz\u2019, not \u2018were\u2019.\u201d Remus said.\n\u201cBad grammar, Lupin,\u201d Sirius yawned, \u201cCouldn\u2019t have lived with myself.\u201d He stretched sleepily and backed onto Remus\u2019 bed, which happened to be nearest, curling up to sleep.\nRemus looked at him for a while from his window ledge. With his eyes closed, in the gentle dawn light, Sirius seemed softer, younger. Remus had spent the whole year in awe of him and James; how invincible they were, how daring. But they were all just kids together, really. And no matter how big their final prank was, it wouldn\u2019t stop the train coming for them tomorrow, to take Remus back to St Edmund\u2019s and Sirius back to wherever it was he lived \u2013 a house where the portraits shouted at him, and his family didn\u2019t care that he had come top in Transfiguration.\nHe looked out of the window again, pressing his forehead to the cool glass and sighing deeply. It was a really good prank; they all ought to be proud. McGonagall would throw a fit. Dumbledore would probably like it. There was no need to feel so gloomy, it was only two months.\nFifty feet below, the hydrangeas finally bloomed, and Remus\u2019 heart skipped a beat. The gaudy flowers flashed below in Gryffindor colours, bright crimson and glimmering gold, blaring out their wonky-lettered message.\nTHE MARAUDERS WERE HERE!"

            "content": "Dear Remus,\nHow\u2019s your summer so far? Mine is rubbish.\nLast week was Bellatrix\u2019s wedding \u2013 at least she won\u2019t be at Hogwarts next year. Regulus and I were groomsmen and had to wear\ngreen\ndress robes. Definitely not my colour. My whole family was there, it was awful. You should have seen what Bella did to her hair, she looked completely mental. Cissy has dyed hers, too \u2013 blonde, so she looks like her stuck up boyfriend, Malfoy. I can\u2019t believe my aunt let her, I bet my mum wouldn\u2019t let me dye\nmy\nhair.\nI wish we could do magic out of school, I\u2019ve been researching curses in dad\u2019s library \u2013 should have some excellent stuff for Snivellus next year.\nJames says his parents are letting me stay with them this summer. My parents won\u2019t let me go to the Potters, but they\nmight\nlet me stay with the Pettigrews, so I\u2019m getting Pete to invite me. James said he\u2019d invite you too, I hope you can come. It\u2019ll be great, just like school.\nSee you soon,\nSirius O. Black\n* * *\nDear Remus,\nHope you\u2019re having a good summer, and the muggles aren\u2019t getting you down.\nMum and Dad say you\u2019re more than welcome to come for a visit. Sirius is trying to wrangle the whole summer, which would be brilliant. If you can come, reply to this owl ASAP. Mum says she\u2019ll write a letter herself if your Matron needs her to.\nBest,\nJames.\n* * *\nDear Remus,\nJames and Sirius say they\u2019ve tried to get in touch with you, but you haven\u2019t replied. I told them maybe you didn\u2019t know how owls worked. You just tie the letter to their foot, like we\u2019ve done, then let it go. They usually end up where they\u2019re supposed to.\nHope you can come to visit.\nPeter.\n* * *\nDear Remus,\nAre you all right? We haven\u2019t heard anything from you, I hope you haven\u2019t tried to use muggle post. I\u2019m at the Potters now, it\u2019s great. His parents are really nice, nothing like mine.\nJames is being a bit of a pain. He thinks we\u2019re both getting on the quidditch team this year and keeps getting me up at six to practice flying. Completely bonkers. It\u2019s sort of fun though, and if Gryffindor needs a beater then I might try for it. I can\u2019t wait to show you my broom, you can have a go on it if you want \u2013 you might like flying better if you have decent equipment.\nJames reckons your Matron won\u2019t let you come \u2013 do you think if we wrote to Dumbledore or McGonagall then they could get permission? You\u2019re a wizard, after all, you shouldn\u2019t get stuck with muggles all summer.\nIf you really can\u2019t come, are you going to Diagon Alley for your school things? Maybe we could all meet there in August?\nHope you\u2019re ok.\nSirius O. Black.\n* * *\nDear Remus,\nIt\u2019s not the marauders without you, please come! We\u2019ve got loads of room, and Mum doesn\u2019t mind. I\u2019ve been training Sirius and Pete for quidditch next year \u2013 I reckon that if we get you over your problem with heights then you might make a decent beater.\nYou like hitting things, don\u2019t you? And you\u2019re probably the strongest of the four of us, so I reckon it makes sense. Sirius wants to be a beater too, he can show you how to do it. I\u2019ll even see if we\u2019ve got my old broom still lying around in the shed, and you can have it!\nJames.\n* * *\nDear Remus,\nPlease come and save us from James\u2019 reign of terror. I don\u2019t even want to be on the quidditch team.\nPeter.\n* * *\nDear Remus,\nI hope you\u2019re getting these letters. We\u2019re starting to get worried about you.\nWe all went to Diagon Alley together, it was great. James\u2019 mum bought us ice creams and let us go wherever we liked. Probably spent about three hours in\nQuality Quidditch Supplies\n. I really wanted to get out into muggle London and find a records shop, but we weren\u2019t allowed to leave the alley.\nAndromeda sent me this new album \u2013 Merlin, you really have to hear it, Lupin! It\u2019s better than Electric Warrior. Better than ANYTHING. I\u2019m sure the singer is actually a wizard \u2013 have you heard of David Bowie?\nAre you having a good summer? What\u2019s it like being back?\nWrite soon!\nSirius O. Black.\n* * *\n\nDere Sirus,\n\n\nPleas dont send me more letters. Can\u2019t read them and matron getting anoyed by the owls.\n\n\nSee you on the train.\n\n\nRemus."

            "content": "Metal Guru, could it be?\n\n\nYou\u2019re gonna bring my baby to me\n\n\nShe\u2019ll be wild, y\u2019know a rock n roll child\u2026\n\nRemus gripped the handles of his battered old suitcase with white knuckles, his stomach turning excited somersaults as he watched the bustling crowds. Matron had let him run at the barrier this time, though she looked away at the last minute, terrified. Now she was far behind him, on the muggle side of the station, and he didn\u2019t have to see her again for ten months.\nHe\u2019d had a terrible nightmare the night before that they would arrive at King\u2019s Cross and be unable to get through to platform 9 \u00be - none of it had been real; magic, wands, wizards, his friends. But Remus tried to push these thoughts from his mind as he gazed eagerly about himself, looking for a familiar face.\n\u201cLet you come back, did they?\u201d A cold voice interrupted his search. \u201cStandards must really be dropping.\u201d\nRemus felt his shoulders tense. Why did the first person he spoke to have to be Snape?!\n\u201cGet lost, Snivellus.\u201d He spat. He squared up, turning to face the Slytherin boy with his meanest look.\n\u201cUgh, what on earth is that smell?\u201d Snape drawled, wrinkling his over-large nose. Remus coloured \u2013 he stank of antiseptic, he knew it; Matron had been much too liberal that morning.\n\u201cI said get lost!\u201d Remus murmured, clenching his teeth and balling up his fists.\nHe saw Severus recoil, slightly. Remus knew how he looked \u2013 he\u2019d had two months without magic, surrounded by bigger and tougher boys than Snape. He was wound as tight as a bear trap and ready to throw a punch at the smallest provocation.\n\u201cOi, baldy!\u201d Another voice sounded over the crowd. A boy with glasses and jet black hair sticking up at all angles was leaning out of one of the carriage windows, waving madly at Remus.\nRemus smiled, forgetting that he was trying to frighten Severus, and waved back. He rubbed his head self-consciously. His hair had grown out while he was at Hogwarts, but Matron had shaved it all off as soon as he was back at St Edmund\u2019s, making him look like a thug again.\nCasting a filthy look at Snape, Remus clutched his suitcase and hurried onto the train, pushing past other students to reach the carriage where his friends were waiting.\n\u201cLupin!\u201d Peter jumped up, excited. He didn\u2019t quite know what to do with himself once he was on his feet \u2013 they certainly weren\u2019t going to\nhug\nlike girls, and apparently handshakes weren\u2019t in order. Pettigrew awkwardly patted his on the arm instead, and Remus gripped his in return.\n\u201cHiya lads,\u201d Remus smiled, his cheeks aching with happiness as he sat down. \u201cHow\u2019s it been?\u201d\n\u201cWe should be asking you!\u201d\u201d James laughed, punching him in the arm. \u201cNot one owl all summer!\u201d\nRemus glanced at Sirius, furtively. He hadn\u2019t mentioned the letter Remus had sent him, then.\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m practically a muggle over the holidays,\u201d he replied, \u201cCouldn\u2019t even get into my trunk to do homework; they locked it up.\u201d\nThat wasn\u2019t strictly true \u2013 Remus had asked Matron to lock away his school things, terrified the other boys would get to them. The homework he hadn\u2019t done because he hadn\u2019t been able to. There was a quiet noise of disgust from the corner. Remus looked up, frowning.\nSitting on the seat beside Sirius was another, younger boy, with the same deep blue eyes and long dark hair; the same unmistakeable Black features \u2013 full lips and cheekbones that could cut glass.\n\u201cThis is Reg.\u201d Sirius nodded, offhandedly, \u201cSay hello, Reggie.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nRegulus\n.\u201d The boy replied, irritably, his high aristocratic voice indignant.\n\u201cMy darling brother,\u201d Sirius raised his eyebrow at the other three.\n\u201cHi Regulus,\u201d James smiled, offering a friendly hand, \u201cI\u2019m James.\u201d\n\u201cPotter.\u201d Regulus looked down at his hand as if it was filthy.\nSirius slapped him around the head,\n\u201cStop being such a little prick.\u201d He snapped, \u201cThese are my friends.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\nwant\nto sit here.\u201d Regulus replied. \u201cYou made me.\u201d\n\u201cOh, go on, piss off, then. Dunno why I bothered.\u201d\nRegulus stood up, stony faced, and exited the car, slamming the door behind him.\n\u201cWow, he really has that Black family charm,\u201d James grinned. Sirius shook his head, despairingly, propping a foot up on the bench opposite and leaning an elbow against the window pane. The whistle blew and the train began to pull out of the station.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t have expected anything else,\u201d Sirius muttered, \u201cHe\u2019s totally brainwashed. And annoyed with me. I shouldn\u2019t have been gone all summer.\u201d\n\u201cReckon he\u2019ll be in Slytherin, then?\u201d James sympathised.\n\u201cProbably.\u201d Sirius glowered, \u201cHe knows I won\u2019t talk to him, if he is. Rather he was in Hufflepuff.\u201d\nRemus thought this was a bit harsh. Certainly, he disliked Snape and Mulciber \u2013 and yes, they\u2019d played some pranks on Slytherin house, but Remus had never\nhated\nSlytherin like Sirius seemed to. Surely he wouldn\u2019t disown his own brother just because they had a slightly different uniform? The only thing Remus could see wrong with the Slytherins was that most of them were snobs \u2013 and Sirius, James and Peter were snobs too, though they didn\u2019t realise it.\nThis train of thought left him as they began to gather speed out of London, and Remus could finally relax into the idea that he was indeed returning to Hogwarts \u2013 and that magic was now officially permitted. He yanked open his suitcase and grasped his wand for the first time in months. Remus hadn\u2019t dared touch anything magical since the end of term, but now he pulled out one of his second-hand books (they had arrived the week before from Dumbledore), opened it, and quickly performed\nLetiuncula Magna\n.\nHe pretended he was scratching behind his ear with the wand, and muttered the words under his breath. Sirius must have seen what he was doing, because he had jumped up to pull his broom down from the luggage rack, distracting James and Peter. Remus looked down at the book, his heart racing. The words filled his mind like music, and finally he could read again.\nThe summer had been incredibly dull. He\u2019d attempted to read some of the books lying around St Edmund\u2019s, but without magic it was too frustrating. He\u2019d very slowly got through each of the letters from his friends, but was much too embarrassed to attempt writing back to anyone but Sirius. He\u2019d also had to lie low a lot. Remus felt as though he had passed whole days sometimes without speaking to anyone; the other boys had been told that he\u2019d been away at a private boarding school, paid for by his father\u2019s will. This of course made him more of a target than ever, and combined with his increasingly difficult full moons, Remus had spent much of the summer covered in bruises.\nFull moons were another reason he was relieved to be returning to Hogwarts, where Madam Pomfrey, the school\u2019s medi-witch, was not only more sympathetic than Matron, but better qualified to handle the peculiarities of his condition. Matron had been horrified to see the new injuries Remus inflicted on himself each month, and treated him as though he had done it deliberately, just to annoy her. It had been much worse than the summer before, when he had got away with a few scratches and bruises each night. Now, underneath his muggle clothes, Remus was almost covered in bandages and plasters which pulled and chafed whenever he moved. He hoped he would be able to slip off to the hospital wing soon after they arrived.\nSirius and James were busy telling Remus about their own summer, with Peter joining in here and there, keen to make it clear that most of the time it had been the three of them. It sounded as though they\u2019d all had a spectacular time, even if there was a lot of quidditch. James\u2019 parents had a cottage by the seaside, as well as what James called their \u2018usual home\u2019 near London. The three boys had camped out on the beach, fished, flown kites and plotted their pranks for the year ahead. They chattered about it excitedly for so long that Remus felt like telling them all to shut up.\nHe felt a bit better when the trolley came around \u2013 James and Sirius pooled their pocket money and bought enough to feed half of Gryffindor house. Remus had no complaints \u2013 as usual, he was very hungry.\n* * *\nRemus was immensely glad that he had stuffed his face on the train, because he had forgotten how long and drawn out the sorting ceremony was, especially when you weren\u2019t taking part in it. Regulus was indeed sorted into Slytherin, which came as a surprise only to Sirius, who Remus heard exhale sharply in disbelief. The younger Black brother scurried over to join his peers, and Narcissa, who was now sporting a silver prefect badge as well as a new sleek platinum hairdo.\nSeverus patted Regulus on the back, sneering over at the Gryffindor table.\n\u201cWhat is his\nproblem\n?!\u201d Peter sighed as the food finally appeared, \u201cYou\u2019d think he\u2019d get over a few stupid pranks.\u201d\n\u201cMore like he needs to get over Evans,\u201d James said, sounding uncharacteristically pensive They all looked at him in confusion. \u201cOh come on, it\u2019s obvious!\u201d He grinned, \u201cOl\u2019 Snivellus is clearly madly in love with a certain carrot-topped Gryffindor,\u201d he winked at Lily, who gave him a disgusted look and very obviously turned her back on him to continue her conversation with Marlene.\n\u201cSo because we got the bird he fancies, he\u2019s going to be a pain in the arse for the next six years?\u201d Sirius replied, disbelieving.\nRemus blinked at him.\nBird\n?! Sirius was not the sort of boy who called girls \u2019birds\u2019, he was far too upper class. Where on earth had he heard that?\n\u201cExactly.\u201d James confirmed, looking very proud of himself.\n\u201cNah,\u201d Sirius shook his head, \u201cNo one could care\nthat much\nabout a girl.\u201d\nRemus silently agreed with him. Still, Potter didn\u2019t seem to mind having his theories disputed. He shrugged, digging into his roast potatoes,\n\u201cIf you say so. Must still be annoyed about that time Remus punched him, then.\u201d\nSirius laughed at the memory of that, finally cheering up."

            "content": "Madam Pomfrey was horrified by the state of Remus\u2019 skinny, battered frame when he finally went to see her.\n\u201cWhat has that woman been\ndoing\nto you?!\u201d She gasped, angrily.\n\u201cOh no, I did all this myself,\u201d Remus gestured dryly at his bare chest. The nurse tutted, peeling away another bandage.\n\u201cYes, but she\u2019s barely done anything to treat you\u2026 I had no idea muggle medicine was so primitive! These are magical wounds, they need magical care!\u201d\nRemus nodded, tiredly. He\u2019d grown used to the carnage now, the pain had settled on his shoulders like a heavy burden \u2013 one he thought he would probably just have to bear. Life was full of limitations, he simply had more than others. Perhaps that was why he was so drawn to James and Sirius.\nMadam Pomfrey wanted to observe him over night, but he refused, grumpily. The full moon was two weeks away and he wanted to sleep in his own bed as much as possible.\nHe walked back to the common room slowly, though he was feeling better than he had in a month \u2013 Madam Pomfrey had given him a potion that made him feel loose and comfortable, and pleasantly light headed. There was no chance of a quiet afternoon, though, for when Remus reached the dormitory he found Sirius sitting on his bed, the record player and brand new albums spread around him.\n\u201cLupin!\u201d He beamed, excitedly, \u201cYou have to hear this!\u201d\n\u201cThank merlin you\u2019re here,\u201d James groaned from his own bed, where he was flipping through a quidditch magazine. \u201cHe\u2019s been banging on about that muggle singer all summer.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s\nnot\na muggle!\u201d Sirius snapped, hands on his hips, \u201cHe has to be a wizard. Has to be! You should see the clothes he wears\u2026\u201d\nRemus crossed the room and picked up the record sleeve. He smiled, mildly surprised,\n\u201cOh, Bowie! Yeah, I like him. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a wizard, though,\u201d\nSirius looked mildly disappointed that Remus had heard of him, and Remus hurriedly explained, \u201cI\u2019ve heard\nStarman\na lot, on the radio, but no one at St Eddy\u2019s has the album!\u201d\nPlacated, Sirius settled the black disk he was holding onto the turntable and fixed the needle in place. James sighed deeply and got up, leaving the room, magazine under his arm. Sirius ignored him, watching Remus\u2019 face eagerly as the slow drumbeat began. Remus sat down on the edge of the bed and closed his eyes to listen.\n\nPushing through the market square\n\n\nSo many mothers sighing\n\n\nNews had just come over\n\n\nWe had five years left of crying\u2026\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the same as\nElectric\n\nWarrior\n; it was darker, moodier. Remus liked it a lot. There was a story in it, though he wasn\u2019t sure he understood all the parts yet. As the closing bars of\nRock n Roll Suicide\nreverberated, Sirius lifted the needle and moved it back,\n\u201cListen to\nSuffragette City\nagain, that\u2019s my favourite!\u201d\nRemus smiled \u2013 he could have guessed that. It was loud and rude, and you could dance to it.\nThis mellow thigh'd chick's just put my spine outta place...\nFor himself, he thought he liked\nMoonage Daydream\nbest, because it was weird and spacey. Or\nLady Stardust\n, because for some reason it reminded him of Sirius. \u2013\nhis long black hair, his animal grace; the boy in the bright blue jeans\u2026\nRemus quickly dismissed that thought, sure that Sirius would find it hysterically funny.\nOnce they\u2019d played the album all the way through again, and then re-played their favourites, it was almost dinner time. They sat cross legged together on the bed, pouring over the album notes.\n\u201cMaybe he\nis\na wizard,\u201d Remus conceded, dreamily, \u201cHe\u2019s not like a normal muggle.\u201d\n\u201cTold you!\u201d Sirius smirked triumphantly, \u201cI\u2019m going to get more, too, all of his albums.\u201d\n\u201cT.Rex had a new one,\u201d Remus said, \u201c\nSlider\n.\u201d\n\u201cCool! I wish Mrs Potter had let us leave Diagon Alley, I even got some muggle money from Gringotts.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is Diagon Alley?\u201d Remus asked, though he thought he had some idea from the summer letters.\nSirius\u2019 eyes widened, as they always did when Remus demonstrated his shocking lack of wizarding knowledge.\n\u201cBloody hell, Lupin,\u201d he tutted, \u201cIt\u2019s a wizard street, in London. Muggles can\u2019t get in \u2013 like Hogsmeade.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right.\u201d It didn\u2019t sound that exciting to Remus; shopping was boring.\n\u201cWhere do you get all of your stuff?!\u201d\n\u201cWhat stuff?\u201d\n\u201cSchool stuff \u2013 your books, your robes\u2026\u201d Sirius\u2019 eyes darted to the fraying cuffs of Remus\u2019 black school robes. His own were brand new, immaculately finished and cut slightly better than everyone else\u2019s.\n\u201cSecond hand, I think,\u201d Remus replied, \u201cDumbledore sends them. Dunno how I\u2019d get to a wizard street; I\u2019m not allowed into London alone.\u201d\n\u201cNext summer.\u201d Sirius said, firmly, \u201cYou have to come to James\u2019 place and stay, we can take you to Diagon Alley, you\u2019ll love it.\u201d\n\u201cYou know I can\u2019t,\u201d Remus said quietly, not making eye contact.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll sort it.\u201d Sirius said, with confidence, \u201cTalk to Dumbledore, McGonagall \u2013 the Minister for Magic, if we have to!\u201d\nRemus forced a smile, pretending that he believed Sirius,\n\u201cYeah, great. Thanks, Black.\u201d\n* * *\nThe Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars\nbecame the soundtrack to the Gryffindor boy\u2019s dormitory for the next week, until even James \u2013 who was tone deaf \u2013 found himself humming along.\nRemus had never felt so satisfied and at ease in his entire life. He was away from St Edmund\u2019s, away from grey shirts and Matron and locked rooms and troubled boys who wanted to get him. He wasn\u2019t covered in bandages (at least for the moment), and until lessons began on Monday he had all the time he wanted to read, listen to music and muck about with the marauders.\nHe spent most of time catching up on his reading and completing the summer homework they\u2019d been set. Like a starving man, he devoured every piece of information presented to him, and even went to get more books from the library to investigate further.\nHe also had to have a number of conversations with James before he could convince him that he had no desire to be on the Gryffindor quidditch team. Remus was content to sit in the stalls with his book, occasionally glancing up to watch the other three boys flitting back and forth on their brooms. They were all very good, but it was obvious even to Remus that James was the best of all three. He didn\u2019t even look like he needed the broom; the black haired boy soared like a kestrel, his turns smooth, his dives nauseatingly sharp. Remus hadn\u2019t attended many quidditch matches in his first year, but he felt sure that James would earn a place on the team.\nSirius was much showier in his flying technique \u2013 he didn\u2019t lack James\u2019 skill so much as his discipline. Black appeared to get bored easily, he could go quite fast when he wanted too, but was more interested in looping and swerving dangerously than catching quaffles or repelling bludgers. He needed James to shout at him every few minutes to keep focussed on the game. Peter was very competent after a summer of drills, but he was quite slow over long distances \u2013 James decided he might be better off as a keeper.\n\u201cYou\u2019re acting as if you get to hand pick the whole team.\u201d Sirius huffed as they headed back to the castle after one practice.\n\u201cThey ought to let me.\u201d James shrugged, as if it was obvious, \u201cI\u2019m better than at least half of the current team, and you\u2019re better than both beaters.\nAnd\nI know tactics.\u201d\n\u201cJust try not to be too shocked when they don\u2019t make you captain,\u201d Sirius rolled his eyes, \u201cYou\u2019re still a second year. There weren\u2019t any second years on the team at all last year.\u201d\n\u201cHave some faith, Black,\u201d James winked, throwing his arm over his friend\u2019s shoulder. They strode ahead together, brooms in hand. The sun was setting behind them and threw everything into sharp relief, outlining the two dark haired boys in heroic gold. Remus watched them, lagging behind and weighed down by his books, thinking that they would probably all be a little bit surprised if James didn\u2019t get exactly what he wanted."

            "summary_and_notes": "Chapter Notes\n\nCW - Remus has some quite dark, negative thoughts in this chapter",
            "content": "Remus did not have a brother \u2013 at least not one that he knew anything about. He supposed that his mother might well have re-married and produced a few nice, non-magic, non-monster children. That didn\u2019t really feel like his business; he\u2019d accepted his lot in life long ago.\nJames too, was an only child, and this went at least some way to explaining why he was so cocksure and demanding. Sirius talked about Potter\u2019s parents as though they were perfect saints, but they had clearly spoiled their son rotten. Peter had a sister who was a good deal older than him and had already left Hogwarts. She\u2019d been in Hufflepuff, but Peter didn\u2019t talk about her very much. She was studying at a muggle university, which was apparently the height of bad taste.\nSo perhaps none of them really understood what was happening between the two Black brothers, which might have been why they didn\u2019t take it very seriously. It began the morning after the sorting. During breakfast, Regulus had received a gift from his parents; a brand-new eagle owl. This was his reward for getting into the right house \u2013 which they found out because Severus gleefully read the letter aloud within earshot of the Gryffindor table. Sirius stared at his porridge, not rising to the bait, but Remus looked over at Regulus and saw that he was blushing hard, trying to snatch the letter away from Snape.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t your parents confiscate your owl again?\u201d Peter asked, bluntly. Sirius gave a sharp nod,\n\u201cSaid I can have it back when I remember my duty to the family and started acting like a \u2018true Black\u2019. I don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t need an owl.\u201d\n\u201cWhat exactly\nis\nyour family duty, again?\u201d James mused, loudly, so that the cackling Slytherins could hear them, \u201cGo \u2018round with creeps like Snivellus and Mulciber? Marry your cousin?\u201d\nSirius\u2019 finally looked up at James, his expression half grateful, half mischievous,\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d he replied, conversationally, just as loud as James. Snape, Regulus and most of the other Slytherins who had been laughing were now quiet, narrowing their eyes at the two Gryffindor boys. Peter edged away, slightly. \u201cInbreeding and creeping are key aspects of my noble heritage. And picking on kids smaller than me, of course; cheating, lying and cursing my way into power\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell, mate, I\u2019m sorry to break it to you,\u201d James repled jovially, \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re a Black at all.\u201d\n\u201cGoodness,\u201d Sirius\u2019 hand flew to his face in mock surprise, \u201cWhat on earth\nam\nI?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious,\u201d James shrugged, \u201cYou\u2019re a Marauder.\u201d\nSirius laughed, as did most of the Gryffindors sitting nearby.\nRemus saw Severus\u2019 hand reach for his wand, and quickly grabbed his own in preparation, running through a list of spells in his head, trying to come up with one that would stop him quickest. But Regulus nudged Snape with his elbow, muttering;\nIt\u2019s fine\n. Remus was sure he was the only Gryffindor who heard it.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Snape sneered, \u201cWe\u2019d better get away from all this filth if we want to keep our breakfast down.\u201d\nThis only made Sirius and James laugh harder, and Snape swept from the room, followed by Mulciber and a new first year called Barty Crouch. Regulus held back, glancing nervously between his new friends and his brother. The new owl sat perched on his crooked elbow, surveying the scene with an imperious, condescending look. He edged towards Sirius.\n\u201cYou can borrow it, if you want.\u201d Regulus said, quietly, \u201cI never asked her to send me anything, but you know what she\u2019s like.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d snorted Sirius, \u201cI know.\u201d\nThey both looked at each other for a while, and Remus couldn\u2019t tell if they were staring each other down, or trying to find the words to say something very difficult.\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, ok \u2013 you knew I\u2019d end up in Slyth\u2014\u201c Regulus started, but was quickly interrupted by Sirius getting quickly to his feet.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want your owl.\u201d He said, stiffly, looking right through his brother, \u201cIf I need to send a letter, I\u2019ll borrow James\u2019.\u201d\nWith that, he pushed past Regulus and made to leave. James, Remus and Peter hurriedly got up and followed him. Remus glanced back at Regulus, who looked very pale and very cold.\nRemus didn\u2019t think about Regulus very much after that \u2013 the line in the sand had been drawn, and it was their duty as marauders to support Sirius. Besides, they were all much too busy once lessons began.\nRemus threw himself into his studies this time, in a complete reversal of his behaviour the previous September. He read along eagerly, answered questions in class and completed his homework as soon as it was set. In everything except potions, he was a model student. He had never forgotten what he had read the year before, about people with his problem. They did not do well, once they\u2019d left school. Those stupid enough to sign the register were excluded from almost any skilled wizarding work. He would have to be the best of the best, and even that might not be enough, but he had six more years to try.\nThere was another element to his academic aspirations \u2013 Sirius. Well, Sirius and James, really, but most importantly Sirius. Remus didn\u2019t doubt that Sirius was his friend, exactly \u2013 but he did doubt that Sirius truly saw him as an equal. He railed against the Black family\u2019s beliefs in blood purity, but at the same time often made snide remarks about Peter\u2019s squib heritage. This was always behind Peter\u2019s back, and Remus dreaded to think what Sirius was saying about\nhim\n.\nRemus had learnt during his very first term at Hogwarts that being a \u2018half-blood\u2019 meant that he was slightly less trusted than other wizards. The Slytherins, in particular, targeted students with any kind of muggle heritage \u2013 Marlene McKinnon, whose father was a muggle, had perfected the bat bogey hex before anyone else in their year group, as a means of defence. Lily Evans was protected from torment whenever Snape was nearby, but it was clear that plenty of the students thought that she was rather full of herself, considering the circumstances of her birth.\nSirius never voiced anything quite so strong, but Remus had a feeling that his being better than everyone else at schoolwork was taken as proof that his magic was somehow better. Remus had an extremely strong desire to prove him wrong. It came as a mild surprise; he\u2019d never been very competitive before \u2013 but then he\u2019d never been given the tools to compete.\nOf course, there would always be one insurmountable obstacle for Remus, and in September of 1972 it came towards the end of the month. Remus had been dreading it as always, and in the days beforehand remembered to mention that he wasn\u2019t feeling well in order to prepare his roommates for his impending absence. Truthfully, he had never felt better. Though the transformations had worsened, and the days required to recovered had lengthened, Remus also found that as the moon began waxing and gathering strength, so did he.\nHe was ravenously hungry, his senses sharper, his magic grew thick and heavy on his tongue like syrup and he barely slept at all, instead stating up half the night reading voraciously, trying to ignore Sirius and James\u2019 furtive whispering in the next bed.\nHe arrived at the hospital wing promptly, and Madam Pomfrey and McGonagall once more escorted him down to the whomping willow. They were very quiet as they made their way across the grounds, but once Remus was locked into the shack for the night, he heard the two women stop and begin talking as they travelled back down the long passageway. They mustn\u2019t have realised he could hear them \u2013 that his hearing was better than most people\u2019s, especially on a full moon night.\nMadam Pomfrey was complaining about Remus\u2019 treatment plan over the summer.\n\u201cCovered in injuries! I cannot, in all good conscience allow him to return there, Minerva! It goes against everything I know as a Healer.\u201d\n\u201cI understand, Poppy,\u201d McGonagall responded sharply as they crossed the ground, \u201cIt is a difficult matter \u2013 when Remus\u2019 mother handed him over to the muggle authorities she made things very hard\u2026 we have to \u00a0tread carefully, very carefully. I shall speak to Dumbledore.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a quiet little thing, never complains, even when he must be in such a lot of pain\u2026\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t hear any more, they had travelled too far down the passage and his own screams drowned them out.\n* * *\nIn the morning, Remus came back into his body gasping as if he\u2019d just been born. There was not an inch of him that didn\u2019t hurt \u2013 his head throbbed sickly, needles pressed behind his eyes; his neck and shoulders felt like snapped elastic; it hurt to breathe. Every heave of his chest caused pain to shoot through him and he was sweating heavily even though the air was cool.\nThere was a deep gash across his belly that made him want to be sick. He had lost a lot of blood already, and it was still bubbling up, thick wine red. He half crawled, half dragged himself across the room to a box of emergency medical supplies kept under the floorboards. He pulled out some gauze, using all of his remaining energy, and pressed as hard as he could against the dark wound. He cried out from the pain, but kept pressing. His breathing grew shallow, though even that hurt. He felt dizzy, wanted to curl up and sleep.\nStay awake\n, he urged himself, furiously,\nstay awake or you\u2019ll die, you idiot\n.\nDie, then\n. A tiny voice appeared in the back of his head, out of nowhere.\nIt would certainly make things easier. For you. For everyone.\nRemus shook his head, dazed. The voice was very kind and soft \u2013 like a mother.\nHe pressed harder, grunting with effort. In his misery, he wondered if the voice was right. Was he clinging onto a life that had never really wanted him; that might never be all that much worth living? What if he did die? What if he just closed his eyes? It might just be a matter of sooner, rather than later.\nHe closed his eyes, exhaling softly.\n\u201cRemus?\u201d Madam Pomfrey\u2019s polite knock arrived on time as always. He ignored it; he was too tired now. He rested his head on the dark floorboards and let go of the gauze. So tired. \u201cRemus!\u201d The door burst open and suddenly she was there, kneeling beside him, pulling his head into her lap.\n\u201cG\u2019away,\u201d he murmured, not opening his eyes, \u201cLet me go.\u201d\n\u201cNot on your nelly, young man.\u201d Madam Pomfrey said \u2013 so fiercely that despite his confused state, Remus laughed. Then he winced, instinctively clutching his chest. The medi-witch aimed her wand at his open wound and stitched it together in a matter of seconds, then she felt his chest, where he\u2019d touched it. \u201cBroken rib,\u201d she murmured, \u201cPoor lamb,\u201d she flicked her wand once more and Remus felt an odd \u2018pop\u2019 in his torso \u2013 suddenly it didn\u2019t hurt to breathe anymore.\nHe opened his eyes and looked up at her. She was busy tugging a blanket over his shoulders to keep him warm. \u201cNow then,\u201d she whispered gently, though they were quite alone, \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, giving me a scare like that, hm?\u201d Her voice was so warm, and her fingers so tender. Very carefully, she pulled him into a hug, \u201cWe can\u2019t lose you, Remus, not while I\u2019m still at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\u201cHurts,\u201d Remus whispered.\nShe held him tighter and that did it. For the first time in a very long time, Remus began to cry. Not just a few sniffles, either; as the sweet, kind nurse held him he wrapped his own arms around her soft body and bawled like a baby.\n* * *\nHe had to spend two full days in the hospital wing. The wound on his stomach was not the only one he had inflicted that night, though it was the worst. Madam Pomfrey\u2019s spell had been enough to stop the bleeding long enough to get him out of the shack, but he needed rest and quiet. She gave him sleeping draughts regularly, and he drank them down without complaint, preferring not to be awake. The marauders came by trying to see him, but at Remus\u2019 request Madam Pomfrey turned them away.\nIt was already late on Friday morning when she finally let him go.\n\u201cI\u2019ll send a note to your professors, let them know not to expect you. You\u2019re to go straight to your dormitory and lie down, understood?\u201d\nHe walked up slowly, taking a different route than usual, thinking about the map \u2013 he ought to start work on that again, he\u2019d read something very exciting about something called a\nhomunculus\ncharm. Once he reached the dorm, Remus crawled onto his bed, drew the curtains around it and lay on his back. Beams of light slid through the joins in the fabric highlighting a galaxy of dust motes.\nIt was still warm for September, and someone had left the windows thrown open, filling the room with cool air. The breeze sucked the drapes on Remus\u2019 bed in, then pushed them billowing out. He watched it dreamily for a while \u2013 in and out, it was like being inside a lung.\n\u201cLupin!\u201d A sharp voice shattered his calm. Sirius ripped back the curtains, flooding the small space with light, searing Remus\u2019 retinas.\n\u201cUgh, what?\u201d He groaned, shielding his eyes.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Sirius rubbed his arm nervously.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cRemus, I have to tell you something.\u201d\nThey were quiet for a few long moments. Remus slouched back, too tired to sit up. He sighed,\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s James!\u201d Sirius said, desperately, \u201cHe\u2026 he wants to talk to you.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 blimey, this is hard to say, Lupin\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you on about?\u201d\n\u201cHe knows! James knows! And he wants us to confront you.\u201d\nRemus sat up, abruptly, his stomach flipping over.\n\u201cHe\u2026 he what? Knows what?\u201d\n\u201cAbout your\u2026 you know. Where you go. Every full moon.\u201d\nRemus stared at Sirius. He didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\u201c\u2026\nYou\nknew.\u201d\n\u201cI knew.\u201d Sirius confirmed.\n\u201cHow long?\u201d\n\u201cSince last Christmas. I\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to say anything. Didn\u2019t want to make it harder for you.\u201d\nRemus was speechless. Sirius shook his head, impatient, \u201cBut James worked it out too, the lanky idiot, and now he\u2019s decided we all need to confront you about it. I\u2019m really sorry, I tried to get him off it, but you know how pig headed he is.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus croaked, leaning forward rather suddenly. He held his head in his hands. This was it. He was about to lose everything; everything that meant anything to him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok\u2026 I think it\u2019s going to be ok.\u201d Sirius said.\n\u201cHow?\u201d Remus lifted his head, hot with terror. \u201cMight as well start packing now.\u201d\n\u201cNo! Don\u2019t. Look, he wants to talk to you about it, he\u2019s not going straight to Dumbledore or anything, doesn\u2019t that mean something?\u201d\nBut Remus had already got up, opened his trunk and begun emptying things into it. He might have to leave straight away; they might not even give him time to pack. Would they let him keep his wand? He\u2019d grown very fond of it, and it had belonged to his father, so it was rightfully his. Perhaps if he promised only to ever do the reading spell with it?\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Sirius grabbed his shoulders. He flinched, but only because he expected it to hurt. Sirius\u2019 dark blue eyes bored into him, and he tried to look away. \u201cListen to me,\u201d Black said, very gently, \u201cJust wait, ok? Just wait and see what James says \u2013 he\u2019s your friend. We\u2019re marauders, all of us!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s bollocks,\u201d Remus shoved him away, \u201cThat\u2019s complete bollocks.\nYou two\nare the marauders, you and him. Me and Peter are just your pet charity cases.\u201d He seized his pyjamas from the end of the bed and flung them into his trunk. \u201cI\u2019m not that much of an idiot, Black. I\u2019m probably better off going back where I belong.\u201d\nIt was the first time Sirius had ever been speechless. But then, it was the first time Remus had ever said so much to him. His mouth twitched once or twice, as though he wanted to speak, but couldn\u2019t quite manage it. Remus kept packing.\n\u201cJust wait,\u201d Sirius said, hoarsely, leaving the room, \u201cJust wait and see what he says.\u201d"

            "content": "Despite all of his talk, Remus did wait. He couldn\u2019t see that he had many options, other than to go directly to Dumbledore and ask to be sent back to St Edmund\u2019s \u2013 and he wasn\u2019t exactly sure where Dumbledore\u2019s office was. He hadn\u2019t got that far with the map. The map \u2013 he\u2019d better leave that behind. Sirius and James could finish it.\nAt least he wasn\u2019t tired anymore. He sat on his trunk fidgeting for what felt like hours. Thought about going down for lunch \u2013 but what if they wanted to talk to him right there in front of everyone? He stayed put. He wasn\u2019t hungry anyway. He tried to read, but couldn\u2019t concentrate for long enough.\nEvery so often Remus\u2019 mind wandered back to his conversation \u2013 argument \u2013 with Sirius. He wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about it. On the one hand, once the initial terror had passed, he could see that Sirius was trying to be kind. If he really had known since last Christmas, then he probably had no intention of telling anyone else. And he\u2019d given Remus fair warning, at least. But on the other hand, what Remus had said was true. Just because James was Sirius\u2019 best friend didn\u2019t mean that he would have any protective feelings towards Remus. They were friends, certainly, but only because they were dorm mates. Remus couldn\u2019t play quidditch, wasn\u2019t from a good family, had no money. On top of all of that, would Potter\u2019s perfect reputation allow him associate himself with a dark creature?\nAs for Sirius \u2013 Sirius couldn\u2019t even forgive his own brother for being in a different school house. If family didn\u2019t matter to him, then why would friendship?\nJust after the four o\u2019clock bell rang Remus heard three sets of footsteps tramping up the stairs. He stood up, bracing himself. James entered first, looking very serious and somehow older than all of them. Sirius came in behind him, his expression inscrutable, no trace of the emotion from earlier. Peter was last, looking \u2013 as usual \u2013 very uncomfortable and out of his depth.\n\u201cHiya Remus,\u201d James said, straight away. They all stood facing each other, the room feeling very small, even with the window open.\n\u201cHi.\u201d Remus replied, trying to keep his eyes on all three of them at once.\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\u201cLook mate, I\u2019ll get right to it, ok?\u201d James ran his fingers through his hair, swallowing nervously \u2013 Remus could see his Adam\u2019s apple working, \u201cWe\u2019ve noticed\u2026 well we couldn\u2019t\nnot\nnotice that you\u2019re away a lot, in the hospital wing. Every month, pretty much,\u201d\nPeter was nodding sycophantically behind him and Remus felt a surge of hatred rise up out of nowhere. He repressed it, focussing instead on meeting James\u2019 eyes. They already thought he was a wild animal. Best not to confirm it.\n\u201cOk.\u201d He said, sullenly.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d James nodded, as if they were having a perfectly normal conversation. \u201cEvery month\u2026 around the full moon.\u201d\nHe let it hang in the air. Remus grew impatient to get it over with,\n\u201cJust say it, James.\u201d\n\u201cAre-you-a-werewolf?\u201d It came out all in a rush, and James\u2019 gaze finally dropped, as though he was embarrassed to have asked.\nRemus glanced at Sirius, who was still staring at him with a look of determination. Peter was gnawing his bottom lip, his eyes darting between Remus and James. Remus squared his shoulders.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He jutted his chin forward, as if daring James to strike him. Whatever; he was ready for it.\nJames exhaled,\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\u201cThat it?\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2014I mean no\u2014I mean\u2026 bloody hell\u2026\u201d James ran his hands through his hair again, turning to the others for support, looking helpless.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d Remus said, his voice hard, \u201cI\u2019m off. Just let me go and tell McGonagall.\u201d\n\u201cOff? Off where?!\u201d\n\u201cBack to St. Edmund\u2019s, I s\u2019pose.\u201d As if there was anywhere else!\n\u201cYou can\u2019t leave Hogwarts!\u201d James looked even more worried now, his glasses had slid down his nose and he hadn\u2019t even noticed.\n\u201cI can\u2019t stay if everyone knows.\u201d Remus explained, as calmly as he could.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t tell anyone!\u201d Peter squeaked suddenly. Remus looked at him in surprise, then at Sirius, then at James. James was nodding now.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t.\u201d He confirmed.\nRemus shook his head, not allowing himself to entertain the idea \u2013 to even hope. Hope never got you anywhere; if he knew anything, he knew that. It was a rule written on his skin in thick silver lines.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game. \u2018Keep the secret\u2019, or whatever. If other people find out, I\nwill\nhave to leave. It could be worse than that, they might\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t say it. What was the use in saying it?\n\u201cWe won\u2019t let it happen.\u201d Sirius finally spoke, stepping tentatively forward. \u201cWill we?\u201d He turned to Peter and James, either side of him. They both looked very serious and very frightened, but they both shook their heads firmly.\n\u201cTrust us.\u201d James said. \u201cPlease?\u201d\n* * *\nHe agreed to give them a month. Or they agreed to give him a month \u2013 he wasn\u2019t sure. It wasn\u2019t clear who thought who was more dangerous. It was agony, at first, every moment filled with awkwardness and a new kind of shyness that hadn\u2019t been there before.\nThey think I\u2019m a monster\n, a voice in Remus\u2019 head chanted, over and over,\nthey think I\u2019m going to murder them in their beds, they think I\u2019m evil.\n\nAnd really, when he thought about it, nothing yet had proved that he wasn\u2019t. It had been clear for some time that his affliction was subject to change as he grew into adolescence. Remus had no idea how far it would go. Perhaps one day he would cross that line; perhaps that was simply the way of things.\nFor a whole week, they didn\u2019t talk about it. Not a word, not even a whisper. Remus had felt sure they would all badger him with questions; Sirius especially, but he had evidently been so severe with them when the confrontation happened that no one wanted to bring it up again. In front of everyone else they acted the same \u2013 James was loud and over-confident, Sirius was witty and arrogant, Peter adoring and insecure. But when they were alone together the four of them were quiet, thoughtful and too polite. Sirius\u2019 and James\u2019 nightly conferences became even more frequent.\nUnexpectedly, but perhaps unsurprisingly, it was Severus Snape who ended up reuniting the marauders.\nIt was, of course, during a Potions class. This term, they were embarking upon \u2018pleasant dream\u2019 potions, which would take some weeks to brew.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need to come back regularly in the evenings to check on your potion\u2019s progress \u2013 I shall be marking you on persistence and attentiveness. To that end, I think it\u2019s best if you all pair up so that you can take it in turns.\u201d Slughorn announced.\nThere was a general flurry and chatter as students began to pick their partners. Remus resigned himself to sharing with Peter, as usual. But above the commotion, Slughorn raised his voice again,\n\u201cNo no, I\u2019ve learnt my lesson,\u201d He gave the marauders a severe look, \u201cYou may not choose the same partners you had last year.\u201d\nSirius and James looked at each other, then at Peter and Remus, sizing them up. Remus cringed.\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d Slughorn continued, \u201cI think\nI\nshall assign the partners\u2026\u201d\nFortunately Slughorn was tactful enough not to put any of them with Snape, though Peter ended up with Mulciber, who towered over him, twice his size. The professor split up Mary and Marlene, who were as joined at the hip as James and Sirius, placing them with the boys.\n\u201cI want Sirius!\u201d Mary squealed. Marlene nudged her and they dissolved into giggles. Sirius looked horrified, James looked put out \u2013 he ran his hands through his hair and straightened his back slightly.\nRemus was asked to pair up with Lily Evans, much to his disgust. He didn\u2019t really like any of the girls, but he wanted to work with Lily least of all. She was nosey and tried too hard to be nice. Plus she was best friends with Snape, who was now staring daggers at him from across the room.\nRemus could not forget the incident during in first year, in which Lily had stopped Snape and Mulciber from attacking him \u2013 and her general disdain for his friends. In fact, every encounter he had so far had with Lily turned out relatively unpleasant for Remus.\nShe seemed to recognise his dislike, and smiled at him nervously,\n\u201cHi Remus, are you feeling better?\u201d She squeaked. He grunted in response, head down.\n\u201cBetter keep well back, Lily,\u201d Snape hissed from the desk he was sharing with a Slytherin girl, \u201c\nLoony\n\nLupin\nmight be contagious.\u201d\n\u201cShut it, Snivellus,\u201d Remus muttered in response, trying not to let Slughorn hear.\n\u201cYes, please be quiet, Sev,\u201d Lily said, primly, giving him a hard look.\n\u201cOnly trying to\nhelp\n,\u201d the greasy haired boy replied, lips curling, \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone else coming down with Lupin\u2019s mysterious ailment, do we? Let me know if you need anything, Lily.\u201d\n\u201cRemus and I are quite capable of completing the assignment ourselves, thank you.\u201d She snapped, tossing her mane of red curls and opening her textbook with an elaborate flourish. She looked at Remus, \u201cWe need eight rats tails, finely diced. Do you want to do that, or shall I?\u201d\n\u201cErm. I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Remus replied, taken aback.\n\u201cGood. I\u2019ll start weighing the rosemary leaves, then.\u201d\nThey worked quietly for a while, and it might have been all right if they were at another desk, but Snape was close behind them the whole time, casting spiteful glances at Remus and speaking just above a murmur,\n\u201cOf course, \u2018Loony Lupin\u2019 is quite apt,\u201d he said to the girl he was working with, \u201cBecause he really is utterly mad \u2013 I\u2019ve seen him, wandering around the castle on his own, lurking in dark corners. You may recall he actually\nattacked\nme last year. He\u2019s clearly dangerous, I don\u2019t know why Dumbledore allows it.\u201d\nRemus felt his ears turning red. He turned around, holding out his wand,\n\u201cSay one more word.\u201d He growled. Snape looked him up and down, smirking. Lilly grabbed Remus\u2019 arm and pulled him back,\n\u201cJust ignore him,\u201d she whispered, though she sounded very annoyed herself, \u201cHe\u2019s having a bad time at home and blames it on everyone else, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Remus said, returning to his rat\u2019s tails. The blood stained his fingers.\nOnce they had prepared their ingredients, it came time to stir. Remus was starting to get along quite well with Lily now. She was patient and didn\u2019t act like she knew everything, like James and Sirius. She was a bit of a goody-two-shoes, but he remembered that he was trying to be one too, so he\u2019d better learn to like it.\n\u201cI\u2019ll stir,\u201d he said, heroically \u2013 he\u2019d never offered to do something for a girl before; hadn\u2019t so much as held a door open, his contact with the fairer sex had been so limited. It felt very grown up and James-like. He rolled up his sleeves and grabbed the large wooden spoon.\n\u201cEurgh!\nLook at him\n!\u201d Snape\u2019s nasty, cloying voice rang out loud enough for half the class to hear now. Remus looked up and found that everyone was looking at him. At his bare arms. He hurriedly yanked his robes down to cover the marks, but they\u2019d all seen. \u201cWhat sort of disease does\nthat\n?!\u201d\n\u201cShut\nup\n, Severus!\u201d Lily barked, \u201cWhy do you have to be so horrid?!\u201d\n\u201cLily, just\nlook\n!\u201d\n\u201cMind your own business!\u201d\nRemus\u2019 mind was racing. He wished the ground would swallow him up. He wished he could crawl under the desk. He wished he knew how to apparate. He\u2019d give anything to throw another punch at Snape. The marauders had heard too, Sirius and James raised their heads from their cauldrons,\n\u201cOi, Snivellus, what are you saying about our mate?\u201d\n\u201cOh, stay out of this, Potter!\u201d Lily groaned, \u201cYou\u2019ll only make it worse!\u201d\n\u201cSilence, please!\u201d Slughorn boomed, \u201cYou\u2019re not first years any more, I should think you\u2019re able to concentrate on the task at hand.\u201d\nEveryone fell quiet. Remus was gripping the stirrer with all his might.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Remus,\u201d Lily whispered, looking genuinely upset, \u201cHe\u2019s such a\u2026 oh, I don\u2019t know! Look, I\u2019ve got these.\u201d She held out her hand, covertly. Remus looked down. She held two greyish round things that looked like bullets, or tablets.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He asked, gormlessly,\n\u201cHe was annoying me last week, showing off about how good he is at potions\u2026 I know it\u2019s petty of me, but I wanted to teach him a lesson, so I made these. Then he had this thing with his mum and I felt sorry for him, so I didn\u2019t use them. But\nnow\n\u2026\u201d\n\u201cEvans,\u201d Remus said, exasperated, \u201cWhat\nare\nthey?!\u201d\n\u201cJust something I\u2019ve been playing around with in Slug club,\u201d Lily smiled enigmatically. Remus noticed that she was actually strikingly pretty. \u201cThey\u2019ll react with his potion. It\u2019ll be really good.\u201d\nHe stared at her, awestruck,\n\u201cBut you\u2019re such a\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTeachers pet? Swot? Good-goody?\u201d She smiled wider, showing all of her neat white teeth, \u201c\nSome\nof us know how not to get caught, Mr Marauder.\u201d\nHe shook his head, bemused.\n\u201cHere,\u201d She shoved the pills into his hand, \u201cYou do it. Toss them in when he\u2019s not looking. Oi, Potter!\u201d She shouted across the room. James\u2019 head snapped up, his glasses foggy from the steam emanating from his cauldron,\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nSnape had looked up too, and was glaring at James. Remus moved quickly, pretending to yawn and stretching his arms out, his right hand just reaching over Snape\u2019s cauldron. He dropped in the pills, just as Lily said,\n\u201cOh, nothing,\u201d very sweetly, before turning back to her work. Both Snape and James stared at her in confusion. Remus was impressed.\nHis admiration only grew as she grabbed Remus\u2019 arm, yanking him back as Snape\u2019s cauldron exploded behind them, a magnificent mass of foaming purple bubbles spilling over the brim, all over Severus and his partner\u2019s clothes.\nThe whole class began to laugh, and Snape turned white with rage, his nostrils flaring.\n\u201cOh dear!\u201d Slughorn bustled over, \u201cA bit overeager with the beetle husks, eh Severus?\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me!\u201d Snape fumed, purple bubbles settling in his hair, \u201c\nHe\ndid something!\u201d He pointed at Remus, who winced, \u201cHe must have!\u201d\n\u201cDid you see Mr Lupin tamper with your poition?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCome now boy,\u201d Slughorn laughed, throwing him a green tea towel, \u201cWe all make mistakes \u2013 even you!\u201d\nSeverus spluttered incoherently, and Lily was clearly struggling to keep a straight face, eventually having to turn around, her shoulders shaking in silent hysterics.\nAfter the lesson, the marauders piled on Remus in the hallway, whooping and cheering.\n\u201cYou did it, didn\u2019t you!\u201d\n\u201cBrilliant!\u201d\n\u201cHow did you do it? You\u2019re crap at potions!\u201d\nRemus grinned back at them, neither confirming nor denying. Over James\u2019 shoulder, he saw Lily flash him a quick smile, before hurrying away up the stairs.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you?!\u201d Sirius proclaimed brightly, throwing an arm around James and another around Remus, \u201cHe\u2019s\nstill\na marauder!\u201d"

            "content": "Friday 6\nth\nSeptember 1972\nOnce the initial ice had been broken, the questions came flooding in. That evening, after dinner, all four boys sat on Remus\u2019 bed,\n\u201cWhen did it happen?\u201d\n\u201cDoes Dumbledore know?!\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever, y\u2019know,\nattacked\nanyone?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it\nlike\n?\u201d\n\u201cWhere do you go, when it happens?!\u201d\nRemus gnawed his bottom lip. He\u2019d never talked about his condition before, not to anyone \u2013 except for his conversation with Madam Pomfrey last year. None of the muggles he\u2019d grown up with would have believed him, and he\u2019d been led to believe that wizards would shun him.\n\u201cEr\u2026\u201d he tried to work out where to start, \u201cI was five years old, when it happened. I don\u2019t really remember much before that. Yeah, Dumbledore knows. I don\u2019t\nthink\nI\u2019ve ever hurt anyone. I think I\u2019d probably know, if I did.\u201d\n\u201cSo when you turn, you can remember what it\u2019s like?\u201d Sirius asked, eagerly, \u201cBeing a wolf?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 not really?\u201d Remus thought hard, \u201cMaybe I can remember feeling stuff, but I don\u2019t think I have a human brain while I\u2019m like that. It\u2019s more like a really bad dream.\u201d\n\u201cI always thought werewolves were more\u2026\u201d Peter looked at him thoughtfully, \u201cI dunno, scary?\u201d\nRemus shrugged.\n\u201cSo is that what happened to your dad?\u201d Sirius asked, abruptly, \u201cDid he get killed by the werewolf that bit you?\u201d\nRemus flinched. Not because of his father, but because he wasn\u2019t used to hearing that \u2018w\u2019 word quite so much. He never said it, himself.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he replied, \u201cMy dad, he\u2026 uh\u2026 well, he killed himself. After I was bitten, so I s\u2019pose it was because of me. My mother \u2013 you know, she\u2019s a muggle, I think it was probably a bit much for her, so she packed me off to St Edmund\u2019s.\u201d\nThere was an uncomfortable sort of silence.\n\u201cHave you ever met\u2014\u201c Sirius began, but James gave him a sharp look,\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Black, leave him alone.\u201d\nThey eventually split off to start their homework, and James went for a run around the grounds before it got dark. Quidditch trials were coming up and he was becoming more obsessed with fitness and endurance by the day. He tried to get Peter and Sirius to go with him, but they begged off.\n\u201cBloody slave driver,\u201d Peter muttered, as he left. \u201cI\u2019ve told him I\u2019m not even trying out.\u201d\n\u201cI think I probably will,\u201d Sirius said, casually, \u201cThey need a beater, anyway.\u201d\nHomework was eventually cast aside in favour of a particularly aggressive game of exploding snap between the three of them, with a record spinning on its needle \u2013 The Beatles, because Peter pleaded for a break from Bowie.\nLater, after lights out, Remus sat up reading a book Sirius had lent him. It was a muggle paperback \u2013 science fiction. He\u2019d seen a few films like it at the local cinema back at St Edmund\u2019s, but he didn\u2019t know there were books too. It was just getting exciting when he heard the tell-tale creak of the floorboards that meant Sirius was paying James a visit. He heard the curtains rustle, and low whispering, before a sudden unnatural void of sound which meant someone had cast a silencing spell.\nRemus ignored it, scrunching down into his duvet and focussing on his book. It was perhaps twenty minutes later that he heard the silencing spell being recalled \u2013 it was as though he had been deaf in one ear and could suddenly hear again. He listened to the curtain rustle again, as Sirius climbed back and padded softly back across the room.\nThis time, however, his footsteps came closer, and much to Remus\u2019 surprise, his own bed curtains cracked open. Sirius long, pale face peered in on him,\n\u201cHiya,\u201d he whispered,\n\u201cHi\u2026\u201d Remus replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\u201cSaw your wandlight,\u201d he nodded, \u201cCan I come in?\u201d\n\u201cErm... ok?\u201d\nSirius grinned and slipped inside easily, kneeling on the bed in front of Remus, who drew his legs up to his chest, setting his book aside.\n\u201c\nSonoro Quiescis\n,\u201d Sirius whispered, casting the sound proofing charm so that they would not disturb the others. \u201cHow\u2019s the book?\u201d He looked at the paperback resting on the pillow next to Remus.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Remus replied, noncommittally. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He repeated.\n\u201cI was just talking to James.\u201d He said, settling down, sitting cross-legged, \u201cHe reckons I\u2019ve upset you, asking questions about your dad.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Remus cocked his head, surprised, \u201cNo, I\u2019m ok. It doesn\u2019t upset me; I\u2019m used to it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I told James.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d\nSirius didn\u2019t leave, he just kept looking at Remus. It was making him uncomfortable, he was only wearing a thin vest to sleep in, which displayed a number of red and silver marks criss-crossing his bare arms and shoulders. Sirius stared, openly.\n\u201cHow did you get your scars?\u201d He asked, quietly. Remus frowned, pulling the bedsheets up to his neck,\n\u201cHow did you get yours?!\u201d He snapped. He instantly regretted it; Sirius stopped gazing at his skin and recoiled, eyes full of hurt and surprise.\n\u201cI\u2026 from my parents. The\nLacero\ncurse, it\u2019s how they discipline us.\u201d He said, his voice a little robotic.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Remus dropped the duvet. He sighed, extending his arms so that Sirius could see better, \u201cI do them to myself, when I\u2019m\u2026 when I change, see?\u201d He pulled down one shoulder of his vest and twisted slightly to show him four long white claw marks.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Sirius breathed, on his knees again, leaning forward with his lit wand to get a better look. \u201cWhy do you do it?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not exactly myself. Madam Pomfrey reckons it\u2019s frustration \u2013 because it\u2019s in my nature to attack people and I don\u2019t have anyone to attack.\u201d\n\u201cWhere do they put you?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s this old house\u2026 McGonagall and Pomfrey take me there every month, there\u2019s a passageway under the Whomping Willow.\u201d\n\u201cDoes McGonagall\nwatch\nyou?!\u201d\n\u201cNo! It\u2019s too dangerous. I think they use spells to keep me locked in.\u201d\n\u201cSounds horrible.\u201d\nRemus shrugged,\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s not as bad as back at St Eddy\u2019s, they have a cell for me there, with a silver door. When I first got there \u2013 Matron thinks I was too little to remember, but they put me in a cage.\u201d\nSirius looked up at him sharply,\n\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting!\u201d\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Remus was surprised by his reaction, \u201cIt was to keep everyone else safe. And I can only have been the size of a puppy.\u201d\n\u201cCub.\u201d Sirius said, promptly.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cA baby wolf is a cub. Dogs are puppies.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cSo where did you get bitten?\u201d Sirius had swapped concern for curiosity once more.\n\u201cOh, um, here.\u201d Remus patted his left side, just above his hip. Sirius looked at him expectantly. Remus sighed again, \u201cDo you want to see?\u201d\nSirius nodded, eagerly, leaning forward again as Remus lifted his shirt at the hem. He barely noticed the bite-mark any more, though it stood out as much as it ever had. It was a huge scar, evidence of an unbelievably large jaw. You could count every tooth, if you were so inclined; the deep dimples marring Remus\u2019 soft skin. Sirius got very close now, so that Remus had to lean all the way back to stop their heads from bumping.\n\u201cOh wow\u2026\u201d he breathed, lost in his observation like someone who\u2019d unearthed a great archaeological treasure.\nRemus felt Sirius\u2019 long hair brush his skin, and the warmth of his breath, and pushed him away quickly,\n\u201cGod, Black, you\u2019re so weird.\u201d\nSirius just grinned that Sirius Black grin.\n* * *\nFriday 13\nth\nOctober 1972\n\u201cSo what exactly are we doing here?\u201d James whispered, sounding amused.\n\u201cAnd why did we have to bring the stupid cloak?\u201d Sirius said, slightly muffled under the fabric, \u201cIt\u2019s hours until curfew.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m hot,\u201d Peter complained.\n\u201cShut up, all of you.\u201d Remus commanded, \u201cI\u2019m trying to concentrate.\u201d\n\u201cConcentrate on wha\u2014ouch!\u201d\nRemus kicked Sirius in the shin.\n\u201cI said shut up.\u201d\n\u201cBloody oik,\u201d Sirius muttered \u2013 but he was quiet after that.\nRemus sniffed. It definitely smelled like chocolate. The whole corridor \u2013 only a faint whiff, as you turned the corner, but richer and sweeter the further you walked towards a statue near the middle. The scent had been driving Remus mad for weeks \u2013 since he noticed it late last term. It had to have something to do with the statue \u2013 a witch with a hunched back and an eye patch. It was a horrible portrait, he hoped that the artist had just been particularly unkind, and the poor woman hadn\u2019t really\nlooked\nlike that.\n\u201cHave you brought us here to meet your new girlfriend, Lupin?\u201d James asked, smirking as Remus continued to stare at the one-eyed witch.\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you keep sniffing like that?\u201d Sirius whined, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be this close to you if you\u2019re getting a cold.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t any of you smell that?\u201d\n\u201cSmell what?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026chocolate. Definitely chocolate.\u201d\n\u201cChocolate? Where?\u201d Peter suddenly perked up.\n\u201cI can\u2019t smell anything.\u201d Sirius said.\n\u201cMe neither,\u201d said James.\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming from the statue,\u201d Remus continued, unperturbed by his friend\u2019s teasing. He reached out and touched the stone carefully through the cloak.\n\u201cWhat? Reckon the old bint\u2019s hump is packed with sweets or something?\u201d Sirius was starting to sound bored and irritable. It bothered Remus a little bit, sometimes. He and Peter got dragged along on all sorts of stupid \u2018missions\u2019 by the other two, but if he and James weren\u2019t in charge then Sirius always acted up.\n\u201c\nNo\n.\u201d Remus said, \u201cI reckon it\u2019s one of those secret passages from that book of yours.\u201d\n\u201cReally?!\u201d Now Sirius was paying attention. \u201cCan you actually smell chocolate? Is that some\u2026 special thing you can do?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t lead to the kitchens,\u201d Peter said, knowledgeably, \u201cThey\u2019re on the ground floor, a Hufflepuff told me.\u201d\n\u201cHow can we get in?\u201d\n\u201cPassword?\u201d James suggested, \u201cLike the common room.\u201d\n\u201cScallywag!\u201d Peter shouted at the witch, eagerly. Nothing happened.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it would be the exact same password, Peter.\u201d James said. He was being kind, but Sirius and Remus were already in fits of laughter.\n\u201cWhat about\nAlohomora\n?\u201d Sirius suggested, recovering. Remus tried it, but nothing happened.\n\u201cThat\u2019s for locks, anyway,\u201d James said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it something else for revealing unseen entryways?\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah!\u201d Sirius nodded, getting excited, \u201cYeah there is\u2026 umm\u2026\nDissendium\n!\u201d He tapped his wand on the witch\u2019s hump.\nImmediately, the hump opened, sliding away leaving a gap easily big enough for them to file inside, one at a time. The smell of chocolate grew even stronger, and now Remus could also smell earth, fresh air and other people.\nThey lost no time slipping inside, and the hump closed behind them.\n\u201cLumos!\u201d they all said in unison, throwing off the cloak. James folded it up under his arm and immediately assumed leadership.\n\u201cC\u2019mon then,\u201d he said, holding his wand ahead of them, lighting up the dark passage, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\nThey all followed. Remus didn\u2019t mind \u2013 he\u2019d done his bit.\nIt was a long walk, down a flight of cold stone stairs, through a tunnel that was earthy and damp. But the scent grew stronger, and when they finally reached the end, there was another staircase, leading to a wooden trap door. They looked at each other and silently agreed that James should go first. They watched him ascend, push open the door, and poke his head through. Remus felt that they were all holding their breath, watching James\u2019 torso disappear up into the unknown.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201d He laughed above them, \u201cYou have to see!\u201d He hauled himself upwards, vanishing altogether. Sirius scurried up after him, not wanting to miss anything. Remus went next, but Peter dithered behind them.\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Sirius was asking, staring around at the dark little room. They were surrounded by neatly stacked boxes and crates. The smell of confectionary by now was overwhelming.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re actually in Hogsmeade!\u201d James said, excitedly, \u201cThis is the storeroom at Honeydukes!\u201d\n\u201cThe sweetshop?\u201d Remus asked, thought it was pretty redundant at this point. Sirius had ripped open a box which looked to contain at least five hundred boxes of chocolate frogs.\nRemus had heard all about Hogsmeade from the other boys \u2013 they\u2019d all visited on family holidays before; it was one of the only entirely magical villages in Britain. Older students were allowed to go on their weekends, and often brought back paper bags bulging with sweets from Honeydukes. Standing in the cellar at that moment Remus could not have been happier with the outcome of this mission.\nThey finally coaxed Peter up, and spent a good hour exploring the shop, marvelling at their own brilliance. They chose a little bit of everything, with Remus directing them, as the only one with any kind of shoplifting experience. James thought Remus didn\u2019t see him slip a bag of sickles and galleons from his robes and leave then on the counter as they were leaving.\nThe marauders returned to the Gryffindor common room with their pockets heavy and huge grins on their faces. A prefect took points from all of them for missing curfew, but they couldn\u2019t care less. When they all lay in bed hours later, pretending not to have stomach aches, Sirius called out,\n\u201cThat\u2019s definitely going on the map.\u201d"

            "content": "\u201cI\u2019ve had enough.\u201d Peter said, grimly. Remus sighed, next to him. He knew the feeling, but there wasn\u2019t much point whinging about it now. \u201cI really have!\u201d Peter reiterated, his voice slightly high as he looked up at Remus for validation.\n\u201cI know you have.\u201d Remus replied, hoping to placate him.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve dragged us into all sorts of stuff, got us detentions - and I never complained.\u201d\n\u201cWell. You did a bit.\u201d\u00a0Remus raised an eyebrow. Peter nodded,\n\u201cOk, I did\nsometimes\n, but I always did as James said. And Sirius, even though he\u2019s horrible to me.\u201d\n\u201cSirius is horrible to everyone.\u201d Remus said, getting bored now.\n\u201cWell this time I\u2019ve definitely had enough.\u201d Peter continued. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone too far.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re just being supportive,\u201d Remus yawned, leaning forward on the wooden spectator stands, \u201cThought you liked being supportive.\u201d\n\u201cNot-\u201d Peter grimaced, \u201cAt five o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d\nRemus was inclined to agree, even if he wasn\u2019t going to whinge about it. At least Peter actually\nliked\nquidditch.\u00a0They looked out on the quiet pitch, grass thick and green under a gauzy veil of early morning mist. James and Sirius were\u00a0presumably\u00a0still in the changing rooms with the rest of the Gryffindor quidditch team hopefuls.\u00a0Remus and Peter were both huddled in the stands, wrapped in their scarves and hats, waiting for the trials to begin.\nThey had been there for at least an hour already \u2013 too early even for breakfast, because James had wanted to practice beforehand. They might have said no, and slept in instead, letting the other two go early if they wanted. But Peter was right; they always did as James said, he was just too good at convincing them. Remus yawned again.\n\u201cOh, hello, Remus,\u201d\u00a0Lily Evans came up the stairs, smiling at them tiredly, \u201cHi Peter.\u201d\n\u201cMorning.\u201d Remus nodded back,\n\u201c\u2019Lo, Lily,\u201d Peter yawned.\n\u201cChilly, isn\u2019t it! Here to watch the quidditch trials?\u201d\n\u201cYup.\u201d\n\u201cShould have known James would be having a go.\u201d Lily said, wearily. James\u2019 quidditch fanaticism was not restricted to the marauders dorm room; everyone who\u2019d ever met him knew how keen he was.\n\u201cSirius, too.\u201d\u00a0Remus said.\n\u201cWell, never one without the other.\u201d Lily replied primly.\n\u201cWho are you watching?\u201d Peter asked.\n\u201cMarlene,\u201d\u00a0Lily pointed at the far end of the pitch, where the Gryffindor quidditch team and new applicants were gathering by the goal posts. Remus could just make out Marlene McKinnon\u2019s pale blonde ponytail. \u201cShe\u2019s going for beater.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the position Siri-\u201c Peter started, but Remus kicked him quickly in the leg.\nLily looked at them, bemused, and opted to change the subject.\n\u201cRemus, can you check on the \u2018pleasant dream\u2019 potion tonight? I\u2019m really behind on my astrology and I wanted to talk to Professor\u00a0Aster.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Remus replied, leaning forward on his elbows, \u201cWe\u2019ve got detention.\u201d\n\u201cOh. What for?\u201d\n\u201cLevitating all of the tables and chairs in the Defence Against the Darks Arts classroom.\u201d Peter supplied.\n\u201cReally?\u201d Lily looked surprised, \u201cI didn\u2019t hear about that.\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t done it yet,\u201d Remus said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to\u00a0later\u00a0while everyone\u2019s at lunch. But I expect they\u2019ll know it was us and we\u2019ll get the detention anyway.\u201d\nLily tutted,\n\u201cWhat did I say about getting caught,\u00a0Lupin?\u201d She grinned impishly.\nRemus shrugged, giving her a small smile back. Lily really wasn\u2019t that bad. She had that gift all girls had for making you look stupid, but at least she had a sense of humour about it. It was particularly pleasant to see her without Snape, who usually loomed nearby like a vampire bat, reeking of gloom and disapproval.\nThere was finally movement on the quidditch pitch as all of the hopefuls were put through their paces. James could not fail to impress; he was on top form that day.\u00a0He swooped and dived and twisted in mid-air as if it were nothing \u2013 as if he were swimming, not flying. Remus heard Lily\u2019s sharp intake of breath as James attempted a particularly tight turn.\n\u201cDoes he have to show off like that?\u201d She said, nervously, \u201cHe\u2019ll get himself killed.\u201d\n\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Peter said, \u201cI\u2019ve known him since we were five years old and he\u2019s never even fallen off his broom. Not once.\u201d\n\u201cNo wonder he thinks he\u2019s untouchable.\u201d Lily muttered.\nThe rest of the would-be chasers took their turns, but it was obvious that James was the best choice. Next it was the beaters \u2013 Sirius, Marlene and a burly fifth year were banded their bats and took to the sky along with six bludgers. It was horrible to watch; Remus\u2019 nerves were set on edge as the brutal red cannonballs shot towards his friend\u2019s head and body. Sirius deftly avoided the bludgers and knocked a few out of the way, but Marlene was unstoppable. She flew circles around her competition, swinging her bat with machine precision and sending the bludgers flying across the pitch every time.\n\u201cBloody hell.\u201d Peter exclaimed, \u201cDidn\u2019t know McKinnon had it in her.\u201d\n\u201cHer brother plays for the Cannons,\u201d Lily explained, looking smug on Marlene\u2019s behalf. \u201cShe\u2019s been training with him all summer.\u201d\n\u201cSirius has been too,\u201d Peter said, defending his friend, all previous slights forgotten, \u201cHe and James were at it constantly, weren\u2019t they, Remus?\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t reply, even to remind Peter that he had not spent the summer with them. He was too busy being embarrassed for Sirius, and wishing Marlene McKinnon didn\u2019t have to be so bloody good at whacking bludgers\u2014or at least wishing that there were two positions open for beater. He wasn\u2019t sure why he cared so much \u2013 he hated quidditch, and if Sirius and James were both on the team then it meant he\u2019d have to spend a lot more time shivering in the stands. And he\u2019d been secretly waiting for Sirius to fail at something for ages, waiting for proof that Sirius Black wasn\u2019t utterly perfect in every way.\nBut now that the moment was here, Remus felt guilty for thinking it. Sirius was sure to be crestfallen.\n\u201cHere they come!\u201d Lily jumped up and ran down the steps to meet her friend. Remus and Peter followed her slowly.\n\u201cI got in!\u201d Marlene was grinning, her face pink with pleasure. She and Lily hugged.\nJames looked incredibly pleased with himself too, his hair sticking up wildly from the wind, his glasses slightly askew. Still, he wasn\u2019t smiling as much as Marlene, obviously trying to subdue himself for Sirius\u2019s sake. Sirius had a face like thunder \u2013 Peter actually took a step back just at the sight of him.\n\u201cYeah, well done, McKinnon.\u201d Sirius said, gruffly, looking at the ground.\n\u201cThanks\u2026 er\u2026 you were really good too, Sirius.\u201d She said, nervously. He grunted, still not looking up.\nJames looked at him sideways and made an apologetic face at the girls. He extended his hand to Marlene,\n\u201cSee you next week for the first practice?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, great!\u201d She smiled at him brightly, \u201cSee you, Potter!\u201d\nThe two girls set off back to the castle, arm in arm, chattering away excitedly.\n\u201cSirius, mate, it\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201d James turned to his friend, looking concerned.\n\u201cI know.\u201d Sirius kicked a tuft of grass.\n\u201cYou could have been on the reserve team if you wanted, Singh did offer.\u201d\n\u201cI know. I don\u2019t want to be on the bench.\u201d\n\u201cShall we go for breakfast?\u201d James sighed finally, looking at the other two for support. Peter nodded enthusiastically.\nRemus couldn\u2019t help but feel a little annoyed. This was all Potter had talked about since they started at Hogwarts, and Sirius didn\u2019t even have the decency to be happy for his best friend.\n\u201cWell done, James,\u201d Remus said, rather pointedly, looking at Sirius as he said it, \u201cYou were amazing, congratulations.\u201d\n\u201cCheers, Lupin,\u201d James grinned. His eyes crinkled slightly when he smiled, and his face lit up \u2013 as if that was his face\u2019s natural state.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter said, punching him on the arm, \u201cNice one, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cThanks!\u201d\nThey walked back to the castle together quietly. Sirius still wasn\u2019t speaking, and he was walking a few steps ahead of the rest of them. James jogged to keep up,\n\u201cYou can try again next year, Ardal will have left by then, he told me he was dropping out to focus on his NEWTs.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Sirius replied, shrugging him off. He walked even faster, quickly getting away from them, broom still under his arm. James went to catch him up, but Remus grabbed his arm,\n\u201cLeave him.\u201d He said, angrily, \u201cLet him go if he wants to be a moody git about it.\u201d\nSirius did not join them for breakfast, nor was he in the common room afterwards. James was waylaid by most of the other Gryffindors, who by now had heard from the team that he was the new chaser. A gang of fourth year boys pulled him over to talk strategy, and Peter went too, basking in his friend\u2019s glory. That never mattered with James; he always had plenty of shine to share.\nRemus was not a fan of the spotlight, and took the opportunity to look for Sirius. He wasn\u2019t in their dorm, but that was expected \u2013 clearly Black wanted to mope somewhere in private. But Remus wrote the book on hiding places, and it wasn\u2019t long before he found him, curled up in an enclave hidden behind a tapestry depicting a unicorn hunt.\n\u201cG\u2019away, Lupin.\u201d Sirius scowled, turning away, arms around his knees. His voice was thick, as though he\u2019d been crying, though his face was dry. \u201cYou can\u2019t cheer me up, ok.\u201d\nRemus rolled his eyes, clambering into the enclave with him, forcing him to move,\n\u201cBudge up,\u201d he said, firmly, \u201cI\u2019m not here to cheer you up, you prat.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWhat you sitting here moping for? Your best mate just had all of his dreams come true at once, go and be a good sport.\u201d\nSirius made an indignant noise, still trying to move away from Remus, though there wasn\u2019t much space left now.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d He sniffed.\n\u201cI s'pose not,\u201d Remus confirmed, calmly, \u201cBut I do understand that James really, really wanted to be a chaser, and he worked really hard for it, and he got it. And Marlene really wanted to be a beater, and she worked really hard too \u2013 Evans told us. So she got it. She was just better than you.\u201d\n\u201cPiss off!\u201d Sirius gave him a shove, but Remus was used to getting pushed around, and whether Sirius liked it or not, Remus was stronger.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t even\ncare\nthat much!\u201d He continued, pushing back, \u201cNot as much as Potter. You only did the trial because he\u00a0was doing it, but you don\u2019t\nalways\nhave to be the same. You still beat him at Transfiguration. You still get the best marks in the year. Everyone\nlikes\nyou. Well, except the Slytherins and um\u2026 maybe your family, but who cares. Peter\u2019s family don\u2019t like him either.\u201d\nSirius let out a weak laugh at that, despite himself.\n\u201cSo stop acting like a little kid and go and say well done.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d\nThey both hopped down from the ledge, pushing the tapestry out of the way. The tiny embroidered knights shook their fists at the boys for disrupting their pursuit of the silver unicorn, which whinnied and galloped into a dense copse of woven trees.\nThey walked back to the common room. Sirius shoved his hands in his pockets.\n\u201cDid you all have breakfast?\u201d He asked, sulkily.\n\u201cYep.\u201d Remus replied. \u201cJames saved you some toast, though.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good mate.\u201d Sirius smiled.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus snapped, \u201cHe is.\u201d\nThey were quiet for a bit longer. Just before they reached the portrait of the fat lady, Sirius looked at Remus. His eyes were still slightly pink, but other than that he seemed himself again.\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t\ntry to copy James.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t say you did.\u201d Remus said. \u201cYou compete, though.\u201d\nSirius seemed to acknowledge this. He looked up again.\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t care what my family thinks.\u201d He said this so fiercely that his eyes shone, glistening slightly, and Remus was worried he\u2019d start crying again. He reached out and touched Sirius's shoulder, warily, as you might try to calm a growling dog.\n\u201cI know, mate.\u201d He said, softly. \u201cI know that.\u201d"

            "content": "Friday 3\nrd\nNovember 1972\nSirius\u2019s thirteenth birthday did not fall on the full moon, as his twelfth had. He never told the others about the talking to he\u2019d got from Remus \u2013 not as far as Remus could tell, anyway \u2013 but he did act slightly differently towards his friends. Whereas before he had sometimes treated Remus as a bit of a pet project; amazed whenever Lupin exhibited independent thought; Sirius at least appeared to develop some sensitivity towards the two secondary marauders.\nThe subject of quidditch was still a sore one, and so on the morning of his second Hogwarts birthday James had enough tact not to suggest a lunchtime flying session.\nBreakfast began with a round of \u2018happy birthday\u2019 at the very tops of their voices, as had become tradition for the marauders by now. The Potters sent Sirius a huge basket of chocolates, while James had ordered half of Zonko\u2019s catalogue as a birthday present. Remus was a bit embarrassed to hand over his own gifts \u2013 some old copies of\nMelody Maker\nand\nNME\nthat he\u2019d pinched over the summer \u2013 but Sirius was thrilled; one of them had an interview with Marc Bolan. They spent most of breakfast turning the pages; the three pure-blood wizards laughing at the static muggle photographs.\nRemus kept sneaking looks at Sirius, wondering if he looked any different now he was a teenager. Remus had wanted to be thirteen for ages; it seemed to him a very mature, grand sort of age. He knew it was silly to think you could become imbued with some kind of new wisdom overnight, but it was certainly an important milestone, whichever way you looked at it. Sirius was definitely holding himself in a slightly different way; Remus was sure.\nUnfortunately, the carefree morning ended there. As they finished their meal and were preparing to get up for their first lesson (History of Magic) their passage out of the hall was blocked.\n\u201cSirius.\u201d A stern voice said.\nNarcissa Black stood before them. At fifteen she was taller than all four marauders. She was a fairly attractive girl, Remus thought; if a little pinched about the face. She didn\u2019t have her elder sister\u2019s mad look, and had dyed and straightened her long hair so that it hung in a gorgeous platinum sheet, which shimmered when it caught the light.\nShe stood before them with her arms crossed, Regulus skulking at her side.\n\u201cCissy.\u201d Sirius nodded in greeting. She flinched, but didn\u2019t chastise him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s your birthday.\u201d She said.\n\u201cWell, I was aware.\u201d\nShe rolled her eyes. It seemed she didn\u2019t have her sister\u2019s temper, either, which Remus was glad for.\n\u201cYou\u2019re to eat with us this evening.\u201d\n\u201cCome and sit at the Gryffindor table if you absolutely have to.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d She narrowed her grey eyes, \u201cYour mother has given strict instructions. We\u2019ll eat privately, in the Slytherin common room, like last year.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Sirius lost his newfound maturity and suddenly seemed very much a child, practically stamping his foot, \u201cI want to eat with my friends.\u201d\n\u201cYou can eat with them any time you want.\u201d Narcissa snapped, her hands on her hips now. \u201cBirthdays are\nfamily\noccasions.\u201d\nRegulus looked at his feet, still standing just behind his cousin. Sirius was still annoyed, but finally nodded his assent. James placed a hand on his shoulder; a harmless gesture, but Regulus looked up and stared intently, as if they were doing something foul.\nOnce a time had been set for dinner, the two Slytherin Blacks left, and the marauders stared after them. James looked at Sirius,\n\u201cBad luck,\u201d he commiserated, \u201cWant to bunk off lessons?\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d Sirius shook his head, \u201cI\u2019ll just take a few dung bombs with me to dinner.\u201d\n\u201cWe can see if that time-bomb spell works!\u201d\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d\n* * *\nSirius was gone for a long while after dinner. James paced the dorm room, checking his watch every few minutes and wondering out loud whether he ought to go and stand outside the dungeons and shout.\n\u201cWe need to start working on your map again, Lupin,\u201d he said, running his hands through his (already catastrophic) hair, \u201cGet everyone tagged, so we know where they are at all times.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re a long way off that,\u201d Remus replied from his bed, where he was reading a book. \u201cStill haven\u2019t mapped any of the east wing. I can do some over Christmas.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d James stopped still in the middle of the room, \u201cYou and Black are coming to mine for Christmas.\u201d\nRemus stared at him and swallowed awkwardly,\n\u201cJames, I can\u2019t, you know I can\u2019t.\u201d\nJames waved a hand, resuming his pacing.\n\u201cI\u2019ll sort it all out with dad, don\u2019t worry. Full moon\u2019s on the twentieth, I checked. We can all hang out here until then and leave on the twenty-first.\u201d\nRemus was speechless, but it didn\u2019t matter. James decided quickly after that to don his cloak and go looking for Sirius. Peter, rather predictably, followed him, but Remus was enjoying his book and let them go. He lolled on the bed, and thought about putting a record on. James and Peter had called for a ban on Bowie until the end of the year, but if they weren\u2019t in the room\u2026\nAt the beginning of the year Remus had been so taken in by Sirius\u2019s excitement that he hadn\u2019t told him that he had known all about Ziggy Stardust \u2013 in fact, everyone in the muggle world, pretty much, had been talking about him all summer.\nSometime in mid-July, Remus had sat in the rec room after tea with a few of the older boys to watch\nTop of the Pops\n. Their TV was still black and white, but Remus felt as though he had seen the performance in colour. David Bowie was like no one he had ever seen before. All of them had sat staring with their mouths wide open as the slender, alien looking man bopped across the stage in a patchwork leotard. He was pale as snow, his hair was long at the back, and stuck up wildly on top, his eyes were arresting; one pupil larger than the other \u2013 he was wearing\nmakeup\n. Remus had at once wanted to know him and to be him. When David slung his arm around the tall, fair haired guitarist, Remus\u2019 stomach had done an odd sort of flip, and as the two men sang into the same microphone, their cheeks pressed close together, one of the St Edmund\u2019s care workers had marched over and turned off the television set.\nNasty q\nueer\ns\n, he had said,\ndisgusting putting that sort of thing on telly when kid\ndie\ns might see it.\n\n\nRemus thought about it more than he wanted to.\nWhen the two other boys returned, it was with a white faced Sirius. He looked worse than he usually did after an encounter with his family; closed off and utterly joyless. Even his eyes looked a little less bright, veering into grey.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Remus stood up, concerned.\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u201d Sirius said. \u201cReally, really terrible. Vile. The worst, most unthinkable\u2026 Horrific.\u201d He threw himself onto his bed, face down.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been like this since we found him in the dungeons,\u201d James explained, \u201cNothing but adjectives.\u201d\n\u201cSuperlative adjectives.\u201d Sirius corrected, muffled slightly by his pillow.\n\u201cYeah yeah, you\u2019re being dramatic,\u201d James sighed. He ran his fingers through his hair again. He\u2019d be bald before he saw thirty, Remus thought. \u201cWant to tell us\nwhy\n?!\u201d\nSirius rolled onto his back, staring up at the canopy of his bed.\n\u201cI\u2019m getting married.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d James and Peter looked just as shocked as Remus, so at least he knew it wasn\u2019t a normal wizard thing.\n\u201cNarcissa told me.\u201d He nodded, still staring blankly upwards, \u201cUsually they wouldn\u2019t make a match until I was of age, like with Bellatrix, but Cissy says they\u2019ve decided to tighten the reigns in my case.\u201d\n\u201cMake a\nmatch\n?!\u201d James sounded flabbergasted, \u201cThe Blacks don\u2019t still have arranged marriages, surely?\u201d\n\u201cOf course we do.\u201d Sirius heaved a sigh, \u201c\nNoble and most ancient\n, et cetera, et cetera... They want to hold the betrothal ceremony next summer. I\u2019m supposed to \u2018buck my ideas up\u2019 in time for it. Then the wedding is happening as soon as I finish Hogwarts. Doubt you lot\u2019ll be invited.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s mad! That\u2019s medieval! That\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMy mother.\u201d Sirius finished.\n\u201cUm,\u201d Remus felt rude interrupting, but his curiosity was getting the better of him, \u201cWho are you supposed to be marrying?\u201d\nSirius sat up.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the twist in the dragon\u2019s tail, isn\u2019t it,\u201d he said, angrily, \u201cThat\u2019s my mother\u2019s\npi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance\n,\u201d he pronounced the French beautifully, with a perfect accent. Even in his darkest rages Sirius Black could annunciate.\n\u201cWho?!\u201d\n\u201cCissy.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cNarcissa?!\u201d\n\u201cYour cousin?!\u201d\n\u201cNarcissa\nBlack\n?!\u201d\nSirius nodded. His shoulder\u2019s sagged. The closed off look returned to his face and he lay back down.\n\u201cApparently they\u2019re looking to reign her in too. Andromeda \u2013 her sister, y\u2019know, the only normal one \u2013 she\u2019s pregnant, according to Cissy. They\u2019re closing ranks, trying to prevent any more dirty blood from getting in.\u201d\n\u201cBut there have to be other pure blood girls out there,\u201d James reasoned, \u201cAnd I thought she and that Malfoy creep were going out?\u201d\n\u201cThey are,\u201d Sirius nodded, \u201cShe\u2019s as pissed off about it as I am, believe me. Talk about wedded bliss.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Regulus?\u201d James was asking. He looked as though his mind was working a mile a minute.\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Sirius said, bitterly, \u201cThink\nhe\nfancies her instead?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s quite pretty,\u201d Peter said, meekly. Sirius gave him a look that could shatter glass.\n\u201cShe\u2019s my\ncousin\nyou dolt.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d James held up an authoritative hand, \u201cNo need for name calling, we\u2019re just trying to help.\u201d Remus couldn\u2019t see how exactly Peter was helping, but he bit his tongue and let James continue. \u201cI meant, did Regulus\nsay\nanything? He was there, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cNot. A. Word.\u201d Sirius glowered, and no one mentioned his brother again.\n\u201cRight, well.\u201d James pushed his glasses up his nose, \u201cWe\u2019ve got until next summer. And we\u2019ve got Narcissa on our side, believe it or not. So, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not hopeless.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what hopeless is until you\u2019ve met my mother.\u201d Sirius said.\n\u201cAnd\nshe\ndoesn\u2019t know what a marauder is.\u201d James said firmly. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d He looked at them each, in turn. Remus could see exactly what was coming. \u201cWe have a new mission.\u201d"

            "content": "How on earth could you get yourself out of an engagement?\nRemus wondered to himself, as he made his way down to the dungeons on Sunday evening. He was alone; Lily had asked him to check on the potion they were working on one more time before handing it in the next day. He personally thought it was overkill, but was also guiltily aware that Evans had so far done the lion\u2019s share of the work.\nSirius\u2019s problem had been ticking away in the back of his mind all day. James had charged them all with coming up with a solution by Christmas, but Remus couldn\u2019t see what might be done. He\u2019d never thought about engagement, or marriage, or family honour before. Those were all grown up things. Thirteen-year-old boys certainly weren\u2019t supposed to worry about them. But then, he supposed, turning the final bend in the staircase, nor were\ntwelve\n-year-old boys supposed to worry about transforming into monsters once a month.\nHe sighed heavily, pushing the door to the Potions classroom open. To his disgust, Severus Snape was in there already, stirring his own potion. Their eyes met, and Remus froze for a moment, before squaring his shoulders, raising his chin and walking straight over to his own cauldron, choosing to ignore the other boy.\nBut he couldn\u2019t help but notice that his potion was a slightly different colour from Snape\u2019s, which couldn\u2019t be a good sign. Theirs was a bold, royal blue, much darker than it ought to be. Snape had obviously noticed too.\n\u201cYou need to add more lavender.\u201d He said, nasally, not looking up from his stirring. \u201cAt least another teaspoon.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, right.\u201d Remus frowned, \u201cS\u2019if I\u2019m going to take advice off you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m hardly going to ruin Lily\u2019s potion, am I?!\u201d Snape spat back.\nRemus considered this. It was true that despite Severus\u2019 generally unpleasant demeanour, the only other thing the marauders knew about him was that he would do almost anything for Lily Evans. It was weird, but Remus wasn\u2019t one to judge anyone for being weird.\nHe spooned in some more lavender and stirred. At once, the potion took on a paler, sky blue hue, and a lovely dreamy aroma rose from it. Snape made a smug clicking noise with his tongue, and closed the lid on his own cauldron, getting ready to leave.\n\u201cHiya Sev!\u201d a voice came from the doorway, \u201cOh, Remus\u2026\u201d\nIt was Lily. She looked a bit embarrassed. Remus frowned,\n\u201cThought we agreed I was checking it tonight?\u201d\n\u201cUm, yes, we did\u2026 I was just\u2026 double checking.\u201d Her usually pale cheeks were bright red.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t think I\u2019d show up?\u201d\nSnape snorted, derisively, on his way out. Remus fought the urge to throw a spoon at the back of his greasy head. Lily didn\u2019t notice, she had already crossed the room, and was looking down into the cauldron.\n\u201cWell, you do get a lot of detentions,\u201d she said, diplomatically. Severus swept out of the room. \u201cOh wow, it looks much better than it did this morning. Did you do something?\u201d\n\u201cAdded more lavender.\u201d\n\u201cReally? Nice one, it looks exactly right now.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d he rubbed the back of his head, glancing that the door. Snape was out of earshot. \u201cYeah, I just thought it needed some, I s\u2019pose.\u201d\n\u201cNothing left to do, then. Are you on your way back to the common room?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nThey walked together. Lily was in a good mood,\n\u201cWe work quite well together, don\u2019t we?\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice change from Sev, anyway, you\u2019re much more easy going.\u201d\nRemus had never thought of himself as easy going before. It was a nice thing for her to say, but then compared to Snape anyone might seem relaxed.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the thing with you and him anyway?\u201d He asked.\n\u201cHe\u2019s my best friend.\u201d Lily answered promptly, as if she had to justify this all the time. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other ages.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not as bad as you think he is,\u201d she said, glancing at him sideways, \u201cHe can be really kind. And funny.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u2019s he hang about with Mulciber and the pureblood lot, then?\u201d\n\u201cWell if we\u2019re going to base our assumptions on people based on their\nfriends\n,\u201d Lily looked at him very pointedly.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my friends?!\u201d Remus was shocked. Everyone loved James and Sirius. Lily rolled her eyes.\n\u201cThey\u2019re all heirs to pureblood houses, aren\u2019t they?\u201d She tossed her auburn curls, \u201cPlus they\u2019re massive show-offs. Potter thinks he\u2019s god\u2019s gift and Black is\u2026 well, he\u2019s a Black, isn\u2019t he? Even\nI\nknow about them, and I\u2019m muggle born. I s\u2019pose Peter\u2019s ok, but it\u2019s sad the way he follows them around everywhere.\u201d\n\u201cI follow them around too.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you do.\u201d She looked at him again, cheekily.\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong about them.\u201d Remus said, \u201cI mean\u2026 ok, you\u2019re right about them showing off, but they\u2019re not just\u2026 there\u2019s more to them.\u201d\n\u201cWell then you\u2019ll just have to accept that there\u2019s more to Severus, won\u2019t you?\u201d\nShe was harder to argue with than Sirius. Remus shrugged, noncommittally. It occurred to him that Lily might be able to help with their present conundrum. After all, weddings and engagements were girl things, weren\u2019t they? At least she might offer another perspective.\n\u201cEvans?\u201d he said, thoughtfully, \u201cYou\u2019re quite clever\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, cheers very much.\u201d\n\u201cSorry. I mean \u2013 you\u2019re cleverer than me.\u201d\n\u201cMuch better.\u201d\nHe grinned, rubbing the back of his head.\n\u201cWhat would you do if your family was making you get married to someone you didn\u2019t want to?\u201d\nShe frowned, as if that was not at all what she had expected.\n\u201cLiker an arranged marriage? I thought you lived in a foster home?\u201d\n\u201cA children\u2019s home,\u201d he corrected. \u201cThey\u2019re different. Anyway, it\u2019s not me, it\u2019s\u2026 someone else.\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d She looked stumped, which didn\u2019t give Remus much hope. \u201cGosh, I mean, it\u2019s not something my parents would ever do. But if they did\u2026 I\u2019d be really angry, obviously. And hurt.\u201d\n\u201cHurt?\u201d He asked, puzzled.\n\u201cWell, obviously. Your parents are supposed to love you and want what\u2019s best for you\u2026 making a decision like that on your behalf is the complete opposite.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d he nodded, though he didn\u2019t really understand, \u201cWell this person er\u2026 doesn\u2019t really get on with their parents anyway.\u201d\n\u201cEven so,\u201d Lily shrugged, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not hurt by it. You should be able to trust the people who raised you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, ok.\u201d Remus didn\u2019t know what to say to that. He had a horrible churning sensation in his stomach \u2013 the same feeling he used to get when called upon to read out loud. Lily hadn\u2019t noticed.\u00a0 They were almost at the common room now.\n\u201cI still don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do,\u201d she sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s like the only option is to defy them \u2013 the parents. But that\u2019s going to cause all sorts of problems\u2026 Who is this about? Go on, tell me!\u201d\nRemus shook his head,\n\u201cCan\u2019t. Sorry.\u201d\nLily nodded, understanding. Remus smiled at her. She had an immensely soothing presence.\n\u201c\nFlibbertigibbet\n,\u201d Lily said to the portrait, which swung open for them to crawl through.\nJames had not long returned from quidditch practice and was still in his red flying robes. He sat on one of the sofas flicking Zonko\u2019s bursting beans into the fireplace, where they burst in a riot of colour like miniature fireworks. Sirius lay on the rug beneath him reading a book on hexes he\u2019d brought from home.\n\u201cAlright, Lupin?\u201d James grinned. Remus nodded to Lily and went over to his friends. The redhead went straight up the stairs to the girl\u2019s dorm. \u201cDumped us for Evans, have you?\u201d James asked, smirking.\n\u201cPotions.\u201d Remus replied.\n\u201cRight. You friends with her now?\u201d\n\u201cSort of,\u201d Remus shrugged, \u201cShe\u2019s all right. Hates you two.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d They both sat up, looking affronted.\n\u201cBut everyone likes us!\u201d Sirius said, \u201cWe\u2019re loveable rogues!\u201d\n\u201cShe thinks you\u2019re show offs.\u201d\nJames gasped, dramatically.\n\u201cHow dare she! We\u2019ll have to win her over.\u201d\n\u201cWhy bother,\u201d Sirius rolled over, returning to his book, \u201cShe\u2019s friends with Snivellus, she clearly has no taste.\u201d\n\u201cDid she really say that?\u201d James was asking Remus. He nodded,\n\u201cShe said you think you\u2019re god\u2019s gift.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does that mea-\u201c\n\u201cIt\u2019s a muggle expression,\u201d Remus explained, \u201cMeans she thinks you\u2019re full of yourself.\u201d\n\u201cShe thinks that?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Remus looked at him, \u201cYou sort of are, to be honest.\u201d\nJames laughed. Remus sat beside him, grabbing a handful of the Zonko beans himself and flinging them into the fire, one by one. He and James shortly made a game of it, seeking who could create the biggest explosions by hitting the embers just right.\n\u201cForgot to say,\u201d James said, once the bag of beans was empty, \u201cGot the owl from dad today \u2013 he\u2019s spoken to McGonagall and got permission for us to have you over Christmas.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Really?!\u201d Remus was fascinated. Why would a grownup who had never met him before want to intervene on his behalf? He made a mental note never to underestimate the power of James\u2019s will ever again.\n\u201cYeah, doesn\u2019t think he can get you for the summer, though. Sorry.\u201d\nRemus shook his head, wordlessly. He ought to say thank you, but he hardly knew how.\n\u201cJust waiting for you now, mate,\u201d James nudged Sirius with his foot, \u201cHave you sorted it out with your mum? Say you\u2019re going to the Pettigrew\u2019s again.\u201d\n\u201cNot bothering,\u201d Sirius replied, still reading, \u201cJust going to go to yours without saying anything.\u201d\nSirius was rarely ever in contact with his parents, but since the Narcissa development he had been ignoring their owls altogether. Remus wasn\u2019t sure that silence was the best way for Sirius to express his discontent, but as Lily had just reminded him, Remus knew very little about families.\n\u201cMum won\u2019t like it,\u201d James chewed his lip.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell her, then.\u201d Sirius turned his page.\nJames and Remus exchanged a look. They had to do something about the engagement soon; the thought of Sirius being in this mood for five more years was a very grim one indeed."

            "summary_and_notes": "",
            "content": "The Hogwarts Express left Hogsmeade station for Christmas on Saturday 16\nth\nDecember that year, meaning that once the full moon had passed, James, Sirius and Remus had to find other means of getting to the Potters' family home.\nMcGonagall, after lecturing Remus on not letting\nany other\nstudents in on his secret, was sympathetic to the marauder\u2019s wishes, and allowed them to use the floo connection in her office \u2018just this once\u2019. Remus didn\u2019t mind the lecture so much, but he was terrified of using the floo network for the first time. He\u2019d heard all sorts of horror stories from fellow students, and it didn\u2019t help that he was usually queasy for a few days after the full moon anyway.\nSirius received a howler every morning after the 16\nth\ndemanding that he come home at once, but he simply tossed the scarlet envelopes into the fireplace, where Walpurga Black\u2019s screams echoed up into the chimney stacks. James was clearly unnerved by this behaviour, but didn\u2019t say anything. Sirius was always up for a fight lately, and it was just better to steer clear. Unfortunately, as the full moon drew nearer, Remus also had a very short fuse. The two boys bickered over anything and everything, and poor James had to step between the pair more than once.\n\u201cJust write back to her for god\u2019s sake.\u201d Remus groaned on the morning of the 20\nth\n, throwing a pillow at Sirius from his bed. He\u2019d been woken early for the third morning in a row by a howler,\n\u201cIF YOU THINK YOU CAN ESCAPE YOUR BIRTH RIGHT IN THIS COWARDLY FASHION THEN YOU HAVE ANOTHER THING COMING!\u201d It wailed, echoing through Gryffindor tower like a banshee.\n\u201cStay out of it, Lupin,\u201d Sirius flung the pillow back at him.\n\u201cHow am I supposed to stay out of it when it\u2019s in our bloody bedroom every morning?!\u201d Remus growled, getting up now.\n\u201cI\u2019m\nso\nsorry to inconvenience you!\u201d Sirius retorted, dripping with sarcasm. He looked rough, as if he hadn\u2019t slept properly at all, but Remus was in too much of a bad mood to care, and his transformation was only hours away.\n\u201cHow about not acting like a spoilt brat for five minutes?!\u201d He snapped, \u201cYou\u2019re so bloody selfish.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not\nasking\nher to send them! At least I actually get post, at least people\ncare\nenough about me to\u2014\u201d\nRemus threw himself on top of Sirius and began thumping him as hard as he could, incandescent with rage.\n\u201cSHUT. UP.\u201d He grunted, landing a decent punch right on Sirius\u2019s left cheek. Sirius, though extremely adept at caustic insults, was not much of a fighter. He gasped and tried to push Remus away, eventually grabbing for his wand,\n\u201c\nMordeo\n!\u201d He hissed, aiming at Remus\u2019s face. At once, Remus let go, tumbling backwards onto the bed, clutching his forehead. A horrible stinging sensation radiated from the spot Sirius had cursed,\n\u201cYou wanker!\u201d He yelled, feeling his face tightening and swelling up.\n\u201cYou deserved it!\u201d\n\u201cSirius!\u201d James had clambered out of bed too late. \u201cYou\ncursed\nhim?! You bloody\ncursed\nhim?!\u201d\nSirius was looking less sure of himself now,\n\u201cHe started it!\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t even have his wand on him!\u201d\nRemus had climbed off the bed and was staring at himself in the wardrobe mirror. He looked as though he had rolled through a stinging nettle bush backwards. His skin was red and shiny, taut and swelling at a worrying rate.\n\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d James asked, tentatively.\nRemus shook his head, though it did \u2013 a lot.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to the hospital wing.\u201d He said. \u201cDon\u2019t come with me.\u201d He snapped, seeing James pulling on his dressing gown. As he marched out of the room still in his pyjamas, he heard James mutter,\n\u201cAttacking someone who\u2019s unarmed is really fucking low, Black.\u201d\n* * *\nMadam Pomfrey healed him quickly using the counter-jinx, but she was very annoyed about it.\n\u201cWho did it?\u201d She asked him, \u201cIf it was Potter or Black then I want to hear about it \u2013 I\ntold\nMinerva it was a bad idea to let you go away for Christmas.\u201d\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I go?\u201d Remus asked, scandalised, \u201cSirius is going!\u201d\n\u201cMr Black doesn\u2019t have your limitations.\u201d\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not going \u2018til tomorrow, it\u2019s right\nafter\nthe full moon, that\u2019s the safest\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking of\nyour\nhealth, Remus! You\u2019re very fragile\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI am\nnot\nfragile!\u201d Remus seethed.\n\u201cOf course not, dear,\u201d she said, not really listening to him. \u201cNow sit there quietly for a bit, eh? Have you had breakfast?\u201d\nMadam Pomfrey made him stay in the hospital wing all day in his pyjamas. The medi-witch had been working on a new potion that she hoped might make his transformation smoother. She let him borrow some of her books, so it wasn\u2019t too bad, but he felt like an invalid all the same. His face was still a bit tingly from Sirius\u2019s curse, though the swelling had gone down substantially. It might be a good one to use on Snape, he made a mental note to remember to ask Sirius exactly how he\u2019d done it.\nAt about one o\u2019clock, just after lunch, James and Sirius came to see him. Madam Pomfrey gave them a sound telling off, first.\n\u201cCursing your fellow house mate! Cursing your\ndorm\nmate, for goodness sake! In my day you\u2019d have been flogged! And Professor McGonagall has informed me that you know about his special circumstances! One might think you\u2019d have more sense!\u201d\nJames made copious apologies, and Sirius, who barely flinched at his mother\u2019s obscene chastisements anymore, hung his head looking utterly ashamed. Eventually, Remus guessed that this must have been enough to satisfy the school nurse, who allowed them over to see him. They stood at the end of the bed like mourners, barely meeting his eye.\n\u201cWe\u2019re really sorry, Remus,\u201d James started. Remus clicked his tongue,\n\u201c\nYou\nnever did anything.\u201d\nJames kicked Sirius, who looked up too,\n\u201c\nI\u2019m\nreally sorry, Remus.\u201d He had a heavy dark bruise high on his left cheek and his eyes looked a little over bright, Remus wondered if Sirius had cried about it. The thought made him feel funny. He shook his head, no longer angry,\n\u201cI started it. Sorry I hit you.\u201d\n\u201cSorry about the howler.\u201d\n\u201cSorry your mum\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d\n\u201cSorry you\u2019re a werewolf.\u201d\nThey both laughed, and everything was forgiven.\n\u201cWill she let you out now?\u201d James asked, \u201cFew hours still \u2018til the moon.\u201d\nRemus shook his head,\n\u201cNah, she wants to try some new potion.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know there was a cure!\u201d\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t,\u201d Remus said, quickly, \u201cThis is just a\u2026 I think it\u2019s to make the transformation, y\u2019know\u2026 easier.\u201d\nThey both looked at him, puzzled. He shifted uncomfortably,\n\u201cLike a painkiller, I think. Muggle ones don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\u201cDoes it hurt, then?\u201d Sirius asked, cocking his head. Now that the storm had passed he was back to seeing Remus as an interesting specimen.\n\u201cWell, yeah.\u201d Remus frowned. He had assumed they knew a lot more than him, having grown up in the wizarding world, so he was surprised that they didn\u2019t know about the pain. For a long time, the pain was the only thing he had known.\nTo his surprise and delight, James and Sirius elected to stay in the hospital wing with Remus for the rest of the afternoon. They played a few riotous games of exploding snap, before Madam Pomfrey sternly told them to quiet down, so they switched to gobstones. As the evening drew in, they didn\u2019t go down for dinner, but ate the same hospital food as he did.\nThis was no great thing for them \u2013 James and Sirius treated it as any other afternoon; the hospital bed was just an extension of their dorm. For Remus it was everything \u2013 it was time that would otherwise be spent anxious and alone. It was the closest thing to family he could imagine.\nMcGonagall came and chased them out, eventually, ready to lead Remus to the shack. He went peacefully, with a soft smile on his lips and laughter still echoing in his ears. Madam Pomfrey\u2019s painkilling potion had no effect \u2013 but Remus found the transformation slightly more tolerable all the same.\n* * *\nJames and Sirius arrived first thing the next morning. Remus was dozing in his bed, having been brought back into the castle at dawn. His face hurt, and he knew it wasn\u2019t from the curse anymore. Madam Pomfrey had left a hand mirror on his bedside table, glass down, but he had been too tired to look yet. He was woken by the sharp gasp of breath which came from either James or Sirius, he wasn\u2019t sure who. When he opened his eyes they had both rearranged their expressions into stoic cheer.\n\u201cAlright, mate?\u201d James said, with a half-smile, as you might address a child.\n\u201cAlright.\u201d Remus croaked, hauling himself up. It must be bad. He lifted the heavy mirror and turned it towards his face. Ah.\nThe cut looked half-healed already, thanks to Pomfrey\u2019s ministrations, but it was still a shock. The scab was hard and black, edged with tender red skin. It stretched from the inner corner of one eye, up over the bridge of his nose diagonally down towards the centre of his opposite cheek. He couldn\u2019t remember much, but it looked as though he\u2019d almost split his face wide open.\n\u201cMy beautiful face,\u201d he said, weakly, attempting sarcasm, but feeling dreadful. Now everyone would know. So far he\u2019d been able to hide the worst of his scars under his robes, but he knew now that it had only been a matter of time before his luck ran out in that regard.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d James said, quickly, \u201cIt\u2019ll heal really fast, I bet\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHow did\u2014\u201d Sirius began, but was interrupted by Madam Pomfrey who came storming over,\n\u201cYou two back again!\u201d They stepped back, sharply, as if frightened of her, showing deference they never showed for McGonagall. The nurse pulled the curtain around Remus\u2019s bed, closing it in their faces. \u201cAh, you\u2019ve had a look, have you?\u201d She addressed Remus now, in a much softer tone, \u201cI know it looks bad, but it\u2019ll pale just like the others. Should be barely noticeable by the new year.\u201d\nRemus somehow didn\u2019t believe her \u2013 even his most faded scars were still very noticeable. She took a closer look, then smoothed a clear ointment over the cut,\n\u201cTake this with you,\u201d she instructed, handing him the jar, \u201cApply every morning and evening. Does it hurt, still?\u201d\nHe shook his head. She clucked her tongue sceptically, \u201cWell, even so. It might itch a bit as it heals. Perhaps we could try trimming your nails down next month? Though I suppose the claws come in anyway.\u201d She sighed, sounding frustrated, \u201cYour face must still have been irritated even after we got the swelling down.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Remus shrugged her off. He was keenly aware of his friends on the other side of the curtain, and wanted her to go away. \u201cCan I go now? I feel ok.\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather get a bit more sleep?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head vehemently, \u201cI\u2019m hungry \u2013 I want to go down for breakfast.\u201d He knew that would work; she was always on at him to eat more.\n\u201cWell\u2026 fine. Get dressed and off you pop.\u201d\nSirius was very quiet during breakfast, leaving James and Remus to maintain the conversation \u2013 something neither of them had much practice at by themselves. Once fed, they went upstairs to pack because Sirius and Remus had left it to the last minute. James, frustrated by their lack of foresight, marched to McGonagall\u2019s office to see if everything was ready for their journey, leaving them to it.\nRemus packed a few things \u2013 he hadn\u2019t got the others any presents, and he\u2019d made them all promise not to get him anything either. It wasn\u2019t fair. Matron had sent ahead a small package, so there was that. He threw in some clothes \u2013 the others probably wore robes at home, but the only robes Remus owned were his school uniform (and he wasn\u2019t very sure he actually\nowned\nthat, or whether it was just on loan), so he just shoved in his muggle clothes.\nPacked, Remus turned to find Sirius standing directly behind him, looking even worse than he had the day before.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Remus asked, startled.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201d Sirius replied, his voice strangely flat, \u201cI heard Pomfrey say so.\u201d\n\u201cEh?\u201d\n\u201cYour face\u2026 I cursed it, then when you turned you scratched it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Remus raised his fingers to his face, self-consciously. Sirius looked away. \u201cIt\u2019s not really your fault,\u201d Remus said, awkwardly, \u201cI mean, I scratch everywhere else, too. Bound to happen eventually.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you do it?\u201d\nSirius had asked that once before, when looking at his old scars. This time Remus could tell that he really understood what he was asking. But Remus still didn\u2019t have an answer.\n\u201cI dunno. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t remember anything at all?\u201d\n\u201cNot really. I know I\u2019m always hungry \u2013 like I\u2019ve been starving all my life. And angry.\u201d\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\nRemus shook his head,\n\u201cJust angry.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Remus.\u201d Sirius looked sad again. Remus couldn\u2019t bear it,\n\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d He said, half joking, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t think twice about cursing James or Peter.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say it.\u201d He\u2019d been afraid this might happen, \u201c\nPlease\ndon\u2019t treat me like I\u2019m sick, or different, or whatever. It\u2019s one night a month. If I punch you, you\u2019re allowed to curse me, ok?\u201d\nSirius looked like he wanted to laugh,\n\u201cAre you saying you\u2019re planning to punch me again?\u201d\nRemus threw a sock at him,\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t sort out those bastard howlers, maybe.\u201d\n* * *\nTravelling by floo powder was nothing compared to feeling your own spine elongate every month, and Remus wasn\u2019t sure what all the fuss had been about. He was the second to step out of the fireplace into the Potter\u2019s lounge, after James. Brushing soot from his shoulders he quickly hopped off the hearth rug to make room for Sirius, and watched as James was pulled into a hearty embrace by both of his parents.\nMr and Mrs Potter were quite a bit older than Remus had imagined, but both had kind, merry faces that shared familiar features with their son. Mr Potter\u2019s hair was white as snow, but stuck up at every angle exactly like James\u2019s. Mrs Potter had his winning smile and warm hazel eyes. They both hugged Sirius too, while Remus shrank back, feeling horribly out of place.\nFinally, Mrs Potter turned her sunny smile on him. Thankfully she did not make to hug him too, perhaps sensing that he was uncomfortable. She simply nodded at him gently,\n\u201cHello, Remus, we\u2019ve heard ever so much about you, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re spending Christmas with us.\u201d\nRemus smiled back shyly, but couldn\u2019t bring himself to speak. It didn\u2019t matter; James and Sirius were chattering nineteen to the dozen with Mr Potter, who looked like a schoolboy himself, eyes twinkling with fun and mischief.\nThe sitting room \u2013 Remus supposed it was a sitting room, as it had three sofas in it \u2013 was the biggest he\u2019d ever been in, with wide, tall windows letting in soft winter sunlight that pooled onto the polished hardwood floors. A gigantic Christmas tree stood in one corner, glimmering with silver dust and surrounded by a mountain of brightly wrapped presents.\nPaper chains and streamers were draped across the ceiling and along the picture rails, and even the magical portraits had decorated their frames with fairy lights. As they were led through the house (\u201cFor goodness sakes\u2019, Fleamont, let the boys put their things away before you start planning whatever it is I know you\u2019re planning,\u201d) he found that every room, even the hallways were decorated with lights, tinsel and hundreds and hundreds of festive cards. The Potter\u2019s must be very popular wizards indeed. They were certainly wealthy \u2013 the sweeping mahogany staircase continued up three more flights.\nJames\u2019s bedroom was big enough for all three of them \u2013 bigger than their dorm room at Hogwarts, with a king sized four poster bed, but Remus was surprised to find that there were four equally large bedrooms which were unoccupied. Sirius had already claimed the one next to James, so Remus put his bag in the third room, wondering what it would be like to sleep alone for the first time.\n\u201cCome on then, lads!\u201d Mr Potter yelled up the stairs in a booming voice, \u201cIt\u2019s been snowing all afternoon and I\u2019ve got the toboggans ready!\u201d"

            "content": "Remus had thought that nothing could be much better than Christmas at Hogwarts, which was (quite literally) magical. Christmas at the Potter\u2019s, however, was an entirely different experience that seemed only to get better.\nFirst there was tobogganing down the snowy slopes in the back garden \u2013 though at over five hundred acres, no one could really call it a garden. Peter, who lived further down in the main village, came out to join them as soon as he heard they had arrived, and they had an extremely noisy and violent afternoon careering down the hillsides and playing complex wargames with snowball ammunition. Mr Potter even joined in; sprightly for his age and with the considerable advantage of being able to use magic.\nMrs Potter called them all in for lunch and made them all change out of their freezing wet clothes. They sat by the fireplace, warm and dry eating hot toasted teacakes smeared with rich yellow butter. In the afternoon they wanted to go out again, but Mr Potter had gone to lie down and Mrs Potter didn\u2019t want them to go out so close to nightfall. Instead they helped her decorate an enormous Christmas cake with white royal icing and tiny magical figurines, then to wrap presents for the neighbours and their house elves,\n\u201cWe never got anything for the house elf,\u201d Sirius said matter-of-factly, his fingers hopelessly bound up in some spell-o-tape, \u201cMind you, Kreacher\u2019s a moody git; I doubt he wants anything.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll take gifts as long as it\u2019s something edible, I find,\u201d Mrs Potter replied, smiling, \u201cNo clothes, of course, that only upsets them.\u201d\n\u201cTell mum what your lot does to house elves, Sirius,\u201d James grinned, binding his friend\u2019s hands up even more. Sirius laughed, lightly,\n\u201cMounts their heads.\u201d He said, \u201cOnce they\u2019re dead. At least, I\nthink\nwe wait until they\u2019re dead\u2026 Kreacher\u2019s the only house elf I remember.\u201d\n\u201cGoodness,\u201d said Mrs Potter, \u201cI had rather thought that tradition had died out.\u201d\n\u201cNot with the Blacks,\u201d Sirius sighed. Remus could tell that he was thinking about the betrothal again.\n\u201cYou\u2019re making a lovely job of that, Remus,\u201d Mrs Potter observed, glancing over at the book he was wrapping for Mrs Pettigrew. \u201cUnlike\nsome\nnaughty boys I could mention\u2026\u201d she turned a stern gaze upon her son and his best friend, now attempting to tape their hands to the table top.\nRemus smiled at her, politely, feeling the fresh cut on his face pull at his skin. He still hadn\u2019t really said anything to either of James\u2019s parents yet. He\u2019d always been told to be seen and not heard around older people \u2013 and he had never been to a friend\u2019s house before. Sirius, by contrast, was completely at ease, Remus had never seen him happier. He doted on Mrs Potter as if she was his own mother \u2013 if he\u2019d\nliked\nhis own mother, of course.\nRemus yawned, more widely than he meant to, trying to hide behind his hands, ducking his head embarrassed. He had only slept a few hours that morning following the moon, and an afternoon of snowball manoeuvres had left him exhausted.\n\u201cYou\u2019d better go up to bed, dear,\u201d Mrs Potter said, ignoring the fact that it was only three o\u2019clock in the afternoon. Remus wondered if James had told his parents about him \u2013 they must know, McGonagall might not have let him come otherwise.\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re all right, aren\u2019t you, Lupin?\u201d Sirius cajoled, \u201cPeter\u2019s coming back in a bit, we can go out again.\u201d\nRemus blinked at him, then looked at James for help.\n\u201cLeave him alone, Sirius,\u201d Mrs Potter chided, \u201cThe poor boy\u2019s dead on his feet. Come on, dear, off you go.\u201d\nGratefully, Remus got up from the kitchen table and made his way up to bed. As he changed into his night things, he couldn\u2019t help but steal another glance at himself in the mirror, now that he was properly alone. Perhaps it was having been out in the cold, but the scar looked worse than it had that morning, the contrast harsher with his pale skin. Would his face always surprise him, now? Would be always catch a glimpse of himself in some mirror or shining surface and jump? Would other people be afraid of him?\nThere was a soft tap at the door, just as Remus was about to put on the ointment Madam Pomfrey had given him. It was Sirius, Remus caught his scent before he even knocked.\n\u201cAlright?\u201d The dark haired boy crept inside, speaking quietly. He held a pewter goblet in his hand. \"James's mum sent you this. It\u2019s a healing draught, I think.\u201d\n\u201cOh, thanks.\u201d Remus nodded tiredly. Sirius set it down on the bedside table.\n\u201cYou ok?\u201d\n\u201cFine. Just tired, mate.\u201d\n\u201cWere we too\u2026 y\u2019know, rough or something?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Remus said, very firmly, probably sounding angrier than he meant to. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with you two, it\u2019s just the fact that I was up all night howling at the bloody moon and trying to rip my own face off. I\u2019m tired.\u201d\nRemus had to sit down, the effort of the outburst made him dizzy.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Sirius said, even more quietly. It was the second time he\u2019d apologised that day, and Remus hated the sound of it. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you.\u201d He closed the door.\nRemus couldn\u2019t bring himself to start worrying about hurting Sirius\u2019s feelings. He smeared on some of the ointment, then sniffed the goblet Mrs Potter had sent. He recognised it as something he\u2019d had before at Hogwarts, which would trigger instant sleep. Getting into bed, he drained it quickly, and closed his eyes.\n* * *\nThe remaining days before Christmas passed quickly, and Remus was able to experience real family life for the first time. Mr and Mrs Potter had to be the perfect parents \u2013 they were kind and sure, always smiling and full of fun. Remus hadn\u2019t known that adults could be that way. He hadn\u2019t known that people could grow up like that. It was clearer than ever why James was the way he was \u2013 as brimming with love and blind confidence as Remus was brimming with rage. It was obvious, too, why Sirius was so drawn to the family. He had an unquenchable thirst for love, and the Potters had an endless supply.\nThe four boys tramped all over the surrounding countryside in the snow, bundled up in their warm Gryffindor scarves, hats and gloves. In the evenings they played card games, helped Mrs Potter prepare dinner and listened to Mr Potter telling ghost stories around the fireplace. They made mince pies and paper chains, they built snow-wizards and igloos, and they slept so soundly in their beds at night that not even a howler could have woken them.\nUnfortunately, it was not to last. While the Black's had stopped sending howlers, they had not forgotten their wayward son and tried a new tact on Christmas eve, with devastating consequences for the marauders.\nThey were drinking warm butterbeer and sitting on the hearth rug. James and Sirius were playing gobstones, very loudly, and Mr Potter was teaching Remus to play chess. The old man had been horrified that Remus didn't know how, and Remus was surprised to find himself actually quite enjoying the game. The whole room felt warm and safe, heavy curtains drawn against the cold and dark, tree lights twinkling softly and the fire popping and crackling beside them. The clock had just struck nine, and Mrs Potter was keen to send them all to bed, when there was a loud *CRACK* just outside the window.\nMr and Mrs Potter shared a quick glance, and Remus's ears pricked like a dog. The smell of spent magic permeated the air, like burnt toast. Something dark and unsavoury. There was a firm, hollow knock at the door.\n\"Weren't expecting anyone, were we Effie?\" Mr Potter frowned slightly at his wife. She shook her heard, and they both listened.\nThe Potter's house elf, Gully, went scampering towards the front door to answer it. There were stilted voices in the hall, and Gully came hurrying in.\n\"Oh, Mr Potter, Mr Potter, she's come for young master Black, she's telling me she's his mother! I told them to wait there for you.\" The elf was wringing his hands anxiously, clearly very confused by this turn of events.\nSirius and James looked at each other. Sirius's face was white \u2013 he looked like he might be sick.\n\"She wouldn't...\" He whispered.\nMr Potter was already up and out of the door. There were raised voices in the hallway now \u2013 Remus recognised Mrs Black's sharp tone from her horrid letters.\n\"Sirius,\" Mrs Potter said, gently, \"Did your parents give you permission to visit us, dear?\" He looked at the floor. She clucked her tongue. \"Oh, sweetheart.\" She said, sounding very sad.\n\"Don't make him leave, mum!\" James stood up, \"He hates them!\"\n\"They're his parents, James.\"\n\"Sirius!\" Mr Potter called from the hall.\nSirius got up, James did too. Remus didn't want to, he wanted to stay by the fire where they'd all been so happy just moments beforehand. But Mrs Potter had stood up too, and this was one of those times the marauders had to present a united front, no matter how frightening Sirius's mother was.\nThey all filed out into the hall. Remus had seen Mrs Black once before, the first time he'd boarded the Hogwarts Express. Back then he had simply thought she looked very severe, and that she looked like Sirius. She still looked severe \u2013 her hair was slicked back and pulled up in a high bun which coiled like a serpent at the crown of her head, fixed with an emerald pin. Her eyes were dark, not as blue as Sirius's, but she had that Black family bone structure and superior look. She was shorter than Mr Potter, but still managed to gaze at him as though he was filth on her boot. Her look sharpened as she saw James and Remus appear.\n\"Sirius.\" She said, coldly, narrowing her eyes at her eldest son. \"You will come with me at once. Kreacher!\" She snapped her fingers and an old, wizened looking house elf emerged from behind her robes. \"Go upstairs and fetch master Black's things.\" The houise elf bowed deeply, kissing the silver capped toes of Mrs Black's pointed boots, and scurrying upstairs.\n\"Good evening, Walpurga,\" Mrs Potter said, pleasantly, as if there was no tension at all, \"May I offer you a drink? We were just about to crack out the mince pies, weren't we, boys?\"\nMrs Black ignored her, looking straight at Sirius,\n\"Put on your cloak. We're leaving now.\"\n\"But mother, I--\"\n\"Don't you dare speak to me.\" She hissed, eyes flashing.\nRemus wanted to run away; she was worse than Matron one hundred times over. She was worse than Bellatrix and Snape and every nasty person he had ever met. The thought of letting Sirius go with her made his insides twist. Mr and Mrs Potter seemed to be suffering from the same crisis,\n\"Walpurga, why not let him stay?\" Mrs Potter tried, \"I know he's been a bit naughty, but there's no harm done. We can have him for lunch and send him back before dinner tomorrow. They've all been having such\u00a0a nice time together.\"\nMrs Black let out a short, crackling laugh, as if the her son's enjoyment was the least of her concerns. She eyed James, her gaze raking over his mess of hair, then Remus, staring pointedly at his new scar. Remus looked at his feet, terrified. She'd know. She'd know straight away.\nKreacher came scuttling back down the stairs, followed by a very affronted looking Gully. Sirius's trunk hovered behind them both, apparently packed and ready to go. Walpurga turned,\n\"Come along, Sirius.\"\n\"No.\" He said, quietly, but very firmly. Remus wanted to tell him to\nshut up\n, couldn't he see how much trouble he was in?! But Sirius was clenching his fists, looking at his mother, \"I want to stay here, with the Potters.\u00a0You can't make me--\"\n\"\nSILENCIO\n!\" Walpurga spun around, jabbing her wand at Sirius. He stopped speaking at once \u2013 though not voluntarily. He opened and closed his mouth a few times, and nothing came out. She had stolen his voice.\n\"Walpurga, really!\" Mr Potter gasped, as Mrs Potter let out a small shriek and knelt beside Sirius, wrapping her arms around him protectively. \"He's just a boy!\"\n\"He is my son.\" Walpurga purred, looking daggers at Mrs Potter, \"And he is heir to the finest house in Britain. He will learn his place. Come, Sirius.\"\nSirius looked completely defeated, his mouth a straight line of resignation. He hugged Mrs Potter back, then stepped away from her. He gave James and Remus a small wave, before following his mother out of the door.\nThe four of them stood in silence after the front door slammed. Remus wondered if James felt as ashamed as he did \u2013 ought they to have stood up for their friend in some way? What would happen to him now? Mr Potter looked furious.\n\"Using a silencing charm on her own son! On an underage wizard! It's morally reprehensible!\"\n\"She does worse than that.\" James said, quietly. Remus nodded, in agreement, feeling as though someone had taken his own power of speech.\n\"We'll have to make the house unplottable, Fleamont,\" Mrs Potter said, suddenly, \"Make it so we can't be found \u2013 you said you were considering it, after the last election. I don't want that dreadful woman in my house ever again.\"\nMr Potter nodded, darkly.\n\"I'll look into it in the new year. Alastor Moody\u00a0owes me a favour.\"\n\"Bedtime, boys.\" Mrs Potter said, her voice trembling. \"Try not to worry too much.\" She hugged James fiercely, kissing him on each cheek. Remus tried to dodge her, but she grabbed him too, pulling him into a tight embrace. She smelled like orange and clove.\n* * *\n\"Psst. Remus.\"\nRemus had just finished brushing his teeth and was making his way down the hall to his room, when James poked his head out and ushered him into his own\u00a0bedroom. They knelt on the bed together. James withdrew a note from his pyjama pocket, \"Regulus sent this,\"\n\"What does it say?\" Remus asked quickly, before James could give it to him to read.\n\"Oh, um, it says 'Sirius is home, do not try to contact him.'\"\n\"That's all?\"\n\"That's all.\" James nodded, grimly.\n\"Nice of Regulus,\" Remus remarked, looking down at the note which was obviously very hastily scribbled down. \"Thought they hated each other.\"\n\"Yeah, well they're still brothers, aren't they?\" James replied, shrugging, \"Family ties and all that.\"\n\"Do you think he'll be ok?\"\n\"I don't know.\" James chewed his lip. \"I never got to give him his present. He said he never gets anything christmassy from his lot, just family heirlooms and stuff.\"\n\"I had a go at him the other day.\" Remus sighed, dolefully, \"About... y'know, my furry little problem.\"\nJames chuckled,\n\"Don't worry about it. You two are always having a go at each other about\nsomething\n. Just your personalities.\"\n\"Oh. D'you think?\" Remus was a bit miffed by that observation \u2013 Sirius snapped at Peter far more often, surely. James grinned,\n\"I told you, don't worry about it. Black loves an argument.\"\nChristmas morning was a subdued affair, though the Potters were keen to make it cheerful, if only for Remus. He was embarrassed to find a bulging stocking at the foot of his bed when he woke up, and resolved to correct this next year somehow.\nThere were the customary socks and underpants from Matron, plus a tin of shortbread. Some chocolate frogs from Peter and a big book of advanced charms from Sirius. James had bought him a book too \u2013\nConjurer\ns\nCartography: A guide to magical mapmaking\n. Mr and Mrs Potter, however, had gone above and beyond. Under the tree he found more sweets, practical jokes, a beautiful\u00a0set of quills \u2013 which he tried to give back (\"we got the same for James and Sirius, dear, don't be silly,\"), and a brand new pair\u00a0of pyjamas.\nThe Potters' extended family began arriving for Christmas Lunch at about midday, as well as the Pettigrews, who brought with them Peter's elder sister, Philomena, and her muggle boyfriend she'd brought back from University. Remus was introduced to everyone as a friend of James', and generally ignored, except for by\u00a0one tiny and\u00a0ancient wizard who was already red nosed and merry from all of the drinks Gully was passing around,\n\"Lupin, you say? Not\nLyall\nLupin's boy?\"\nRemus gaped, unable to answer. He'd only heard his father's name spoken once or twice.\n\"Um... yes.\" He said, finally, blushing hard.\n\"Is he here?!\" The wizard grinned, looking around, \"Excellent fellow, haven't seen him in years.\"\n\"Er... he's dead.\" Remus replied, with an apologetic shrug.\n\"Damn shame!\" The wizard cried, spilling some of his drink, \"Fine dueller; taught me everything I know about boggarts. Temper did tend to get him into trouble though \u2013 I told him not to mess about with that Greyback chap \u2013 bloody werewolves, ought to exterminate the lot of them!\"\nRemus blinked. James looked at him, curiously. Fortunately, Mr Potter intervened,\n\"Darius? Have another drink, old man, leave the young people to their games, eh?\"\nRemus swallowed hard and returned to the gobstones tournament as if nothing had happened."

            "content": "Saturday 6\nth\nJanuary 1973\nPeter, James and Remus arrived promptly at King\u2019s Cross to return to Hogwarts on the Saturday before term began. They all peered about looking for their fourth, but Sirius was not there \u2013 and nor was Regulus. As the train pulled out of the platform, James went in search of someone to ask. He returned with his hands over his nose, where a large boil was beginning to form.\n\u201cNarcissa said it\u2019s none of my business.\u201d He explained, sitting down heavily.\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019re using the floo network,\u201d Peter guessed, \u201cMaybe his mum didn\u2019t trust him to get on the train with us.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d James stared out of the window, rubbing his sore nose. Remus had never seen him so unhappy. James had been missing Sirius more than any of them, and had been so excited at the prospect of seeing him once they got to London. Remus and Peter tried their hardest to cheer him up, but it was as if he was missing his right arm.\nBefore leaving, Mr and Mrs Potter said that they would see what they could do about having Remus to stay with them over the summer, too, and he thanked them profusely. It wasn\u2019t likely, though, so he didn\u2019t get his hopes up. Instead he just tried to be grateful that he was returning to school for a few more months with his friends. Most of them, anyway.\nSirius was nowhere to be found at dinner that evening, nor did he appear by the time they were getting ready for bed. James and Remus had brought his Christmas presents back for him, and piled them on top of his pillow, still wrapped in bright shiny paper and ribbon. Three of the packages were from Andromeda, and Remus knew they were albums. Sirius had asked for anything and everything by David Bowie.\nSunday 7\nth\nJanuary 1973\nOn Sunday morning, the bed was still empty, and the three marauders sat around trying to distract themselves with homework. Remus had finished his and took the opportunity to get started on his Christmas books, now that he could invoke his reading spell once more. James took to pacing the room, went to ask McGonagall where Sirius was (she didn\u2019t know) and even tried Narcissa a second time (she cursed him again). Finally, he went outside to do a few laps of the quidditch pitch on his broom.\nPeter went too, with a box of biscuits to nibble on while he watched. Remus stayed indoors where it was warm; reading, or at least pretending to. Now that he was finally alone, he began thinking about the things Mr Potter\u2019s friend Darius had said about his father, turning the new information over in his mind like a coin. His father was good at duelling \u2013 he\u2019d heard that before. Lyall Lupin had obviously had a temper too \u2013 this was a new piece of intelligence, and an odd thing to know, after so long not really knowing anything. For the first time, Remus considered that his bouts of rage might not have anything to do with his condition. And who was Greyback? The name alone made him feel hot and uncomfortable. He wished more than anything that James and Peter hadn\u2019t been there to hear it all.\nRemus sat by the window in Gryffindor tower, his book slack in his lap, staring into space and trying to make sense of a puzzle he didn\u2019t have all the pieces to. Occasionally he glanced out of the window to catch sight of James acting even more recklessly than usual.\n\u201cWhat the hell is he playing at?!\u201d A voice squeaked over Remus\u2019s shoulder. It was Lily Evans. She was sipping a mug of tea, staring at James on his broom.\n\u201cNervous energy,\u201d Remus shrugged, not turning back to look at her. The light from the window would cast his face into sharp relief, and his scar \u2013 while no longer red and angry \u2013 was still very noticeable.\n\u201cJames Potter, nervous?!\u201d Lily scoffed, \u201cI had no idea he was capable of such complex emotions.\u201d\n\u201cOi,\u201d Remus objected, still looking out of the window, \u201cIt\u2019s not been a great Christmas for him, ok?\u201d\n\u201cOk, ok, I\u2019m sorry, I know he\u2019s your friend.\u201d She always said that right after she insulted one of the marauders. \u201cHow was your Christmas?\u201d\n\u201cGreat, thanks. You?\u201d\n\u201cBrilliant,\u201d he could hear the grin in her voice, \u201cMum and Dad finally let me get an owl.\u201d\n\u201cOh, t\u2019riffic.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\u201cGot some books.\u201d\n\u201cFrom your\u2026 um, from the people you live with?\u201d\nHe finally looked at her, even more irritated. Why wouldn\u2019t she just get lost?\n\u201cNo, from my friends.\u201d\n\u201cOh... of course, yeah.\u201d Lily was consciously looking away, at the space just to the left of Remus\u2019s head. He sighed, heavily, everyone was going to see it anyway. At least Lily was polite enough not to ask any rude questions.\nRemus went upstairs in the end, drew his bed curtains together and settled into\nConjurer\u2019s Cartography\n. The others eventually came up for bed too, speaking quietly, thinking he was asleep. The exercise had done nothing to calm James down, Remus could hear his rapid heartbeat and smell the cloying scent of anxiety.\nIt was perhaps an hour after lights out that the door creaked open again.\nSirius had returned \u2013 there was no mistaking his familiar footfall. Remus felt a wave of relief wash over him, a knot in his stomach that he hadn\u2019t realised was there beginning to uncoil. James and Peter slept on as Sirius tried to keep his movements quiet, creeping into the room and over to his bed, quickly climbing in and drawing the curtains. Remus lay still, listening to Sirius lying still too. There was something different in his breathing. Eventually curiosity got the better of him and he got out of bed.\nNot wanting to intrude, Remus trod as close to Sirius\u2019s curtains as he dared and whispered,\n\u201cSirius?\u201d\n\u201cJames?\u201d He replied, eagerly,\n\u201cRemus.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d there was a moment\u2019s awkward silence. \u201c\u2026I just want to sleep, Lupin. Speak tomorrow, ok?\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d Remus padded back to his own bed and closed his eyes, feeling no less concerned.\n* * *\nMonday 8\nth\nJanuary 1973\nThe next morning Sirius had already left before any of them woke up. His presents, still unopened, had been pushed to the end of the bed. His trunk had arrived at some point, and his broom was back on its shelf. James saved him a seat at breakfast, but he never turned up, and they didn\u2019t see him at all until their first lesson.\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t miss McGonagall,\u201d James said confidently, as they pressed towards the classroom, \u201cHe loves Transfiguration.\u201d\nWhen they entered the room, however, they were all in for a shock. There was another boy sitting in Sirius\u2019s seat. He was smallish and hunched over, with pale, pointed features and big blue eyes. His hair was shorn close to his scalp in the same way that Matron shaved Remus\u2019s head every summer. It looked darker than Remus\u2019s, though.\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?!\u201d Peter whispered, a little bit too loudly. The boy turned to look at them.\n\u201cSirius!\u201d James gaped.\nSirius coloured slightly, and looked straight ahead as if he hadn\u2019t seen them at all. James slid into the seat beside him,\n\u201cWhat happened? Where have you been? What did she\ndo\nto you?!\u201d\nSirius shook his head,\n\u201cLater,\u201d he murmured.\nThe classroom had filled up now, and everyone seemed to be whispering behind their backs. Remus couldn\u2019t blame them \u2013 he couldn\u2019t strop staring either. It wasn\u2019t just the lack of hair \u2013 although that was incredibly disconcerting; Sirius just wasn\u2019t\nSirius\nwithout his hair \u2013 he also had dark shadows under his eyes, and there was not a trace of humour on his lips.\n\u201cAll right, settle down, please!\u201d McGonagall entered the room. She glanced at Sirius. Her eyes widened for a millisecond as she recognised him, but she said nothing, addressing the class; \u201cYour end of year exams begin in three months, let\u2019s see who\u2019s been paying attention\u2026\u201d\nMcGonagall didn\u2019t call on Sirius once to answer a question, though it was usually the only way she could get him to pay attention. Nor did she bother any of the other marauders, who spent the entire lesson shooting worried looks at their friend. When Transfiguration ended, they packed up their things and followed Sirius hurriedly out of the door,\n\u201cWhat happened?!\u201d James asked, trying to keep up with Black\u2019s brisk clip.\n\u201cI said later,\u201d Sirius returned, \u201cWait until break, ok?\u201d\n\u201cBut you \u2013 what did she\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\nThe next lesson, History of Magic, was agony. James was beside himself and even resorted to passing notes to Sirius \u2013 who steadfastly ignored them. He sat stiffly, back straight, eyes on the board. For the first time in two years, Remus saw him actually reading his history text in class. Something was very wrong indeed.\nThey couldn\u2019t get out of History fast enough \u2013 James grabbed Sirius\u2019s arm and practically marched him outside to the nearest courtyard, where they chased away a group of first year girls who were doing handstands against a wall, skirts tucked into their knickers. It was icy cold out, though no snow had fallen yet, the sky was paper white and a storm was on its way. Once the coast was clear, James stared Sirius down, eyes full of feeling, deep creases in his brow.\n\u201cWhat\nhappened\n?!\u201d\nSirius sighed heavily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it look like?\u201d He gestured at his head. Remus had the peculiar feeling that neither of them cared he and Peter were there \u2013 that this was between the two of them, like their nightly chats.\n\u201cYour mum did that?\u201d\n\u201cWell I didn\u2019t do it myself, did I?!\u201d He snapped, angrily. James didn\u2019t react, just kept looking at his friend. That was James\u2019s secret, Remus realised, suddenly, he was always patient and he never took anything personally. How else could you be best friends with someone like Sirius Black? Sirius was now rooting in his bag and pulled out his red Gryffindor hat, which had so far never been worn. He crammed it over his shorn head, \u201cBloody freezing.\u201d He muttered, \u201cDunno how you cope, Lupin.\u201d\nRemus shrugged and smiled, pleased to be acknowledged. Sirius leaned heavily against the wall, looking at his feet.\n\u201cThey let me come back,\u201d he said, quietly, \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t \u2013 one wrong move and they\u2019ve promised to send me to Durmstrang.\u201d\nJames and Peter gasped, Remus made a mental note to ask about it later. Sirius continued,\n\u201cDidn\u2019t get my voice back until Christmas dinner. Had to play my part for that; everyone was there, all of the sacred twenty-eight \u2013 except the Weasley\u2019s, obviously. Lucius Malfoy really bloody hates me now, but he had to be really nice to me and Reg \u2013 slimy creep. Got away with wearing my Gryffindor tie until mum noticed and vanished it. Then I\u2026 I um\u2026 I may have set off a few dung bombs during the fourth course\u2026\u201d\nPeter, Remus and James all winced, collectively.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why\u2026 the hair\u2026?\u201d James asked again tentatively. Sirius looked up,\n\u201cShe said seeing as the usual punishments weren\u2019t having any effect she\u2019d try something different\u2026 I tried to get Pomfrey to grow it back for me, but the old bitch said she wasn\u2019t a beautician. Thought I\u2019d done it myself by accident or something.\u201d\n\u201cYou could tell her\u2014\u201c Remus started, feeling the need to defend the nurse. Sirius shook his head,\n\u201cNot worth it.\u201d\n\u201cRegulus?\u201d James asked, suddenly, \u201cIs he back too? He sent us a note to let us know you got home, but we never heard anything else.\u201d\nSirius nodded,\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s back. Kept\nhis\nhair, obviously. Dad sorted out a portkey into Hogsmeade. He\u2019s still\u2026 y\u2019know, a bit of a tosser, but\u2026 he didn\u2019t choose to be a Black either. He just plays the game better than I do.\u201d He looked past them all, his eyes wide and desperate. Remus felt an awful ache in his chest. \u201cI just wish\u2026\u201d Sirius said. But nothing more. The bell rang, and they had to get back to their lessons."

            "content": "Everyone in the school knew about Sirius\u2019s dramatic new look by the end of their first day back. James and Peter took to walking either side of him through the corridors, like body guards, shooting glares at anyone who dared snigger or whisper as they passed.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look that bad,\u201d James assured him, watching Sirius stare at himself in the mirror. They were hiding in the empty second floor girls\u2019 loo\u2019s during lunch to avoid any more staring.\nJames was lying, Remus thought to himself, and Sirius probably knew it. It looked\nreally\nbad \u2013 he seemed so much smaller. Without the dark hair framing Sirius\u2019s face his eyes appeared larger than ever, making him look young and anxious. The high cheekbones and sharp eyebrows stood out more than ever, giving him a mean, gaunt sort of look. It was no wonder everyone stared \u2013 in fact, barely anyone glanced at Remus\u2019s newly scarred face because of the distraction. Still, Remus thought, glumly \u2013 hair grew back.\nSirius rubbed his head, still watching his reflection. Peter laughed nervously,\n\u201cYou look like Lupin.\u201d\nJames nodded, eyes darting between the two of them.\n\u201cYeah, you do a bit.\u201d\nSirius looked at Remus, and for the first time since Christmas Eve, Remus saw him smile. That Sirius Black smile \u2013 nothing could ever ruin that.\n\u201cOh yeah, I think I see it,\u201d Sirius said, still rubbing his head. He reached out and pulled Remus into the mirror\u2019s frame, so that they stood side by side, staring at each other. \u201cWe could be brothers.\u201d\nRemus laughed too, despite himself.\nSirius\u2019s real brother was waiting outside Gryffindor common room later that evening. He was sitting on the floor with his knees drawn up, staring into space. His hair was still long enough to touch his shoulders. His friend, Barty Crouch was leaning against the opposite wall, looking bored. He had made a paper aeroplane and was directing it lazily up and down the hallway with his wand. Crouch and Regulus were as inseparable as James and Sirius; Barty was fair haired and weedy, with a mean streak longer than Snape\u2019s \u2013 Remus already recognised him by his cruel barking laugh alone.\nRegulus stood up smoothly as the marauders approached. Remus felt inside his pocket for his wand, just in case.\n\u201cThere you are.\u201d The younger boy said, a tremor of nervousness in his otherwise arrogant tone. His eyes kept flicking towards James. Barty\u2019s paper plane began circling them all.\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you want?\u201d Sirius asked.\n\u201cJust seeing if you\u2019re\u2026 seeing how you are.\u201d\n\u201cNo different from last night.\u201d Sirius shrugged.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see you at dinner.\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t at dinner.\u201d Sirius replied, unhelpfully. They\u2019d sent Peter down to the kitchens to pinch some sandwiches and sat in one of Remus\u2019s hidden alcoves to eat. Remus was quite enjoying this game \u2013 avoiding the rest of the students, even the Gryffindor\u2019s. Usually James and Sirius would do everything in their power to be noticed, Remus much preferred flying under the radar.\n\u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d Regulus addressed his older brother.\nSirius spread his arms, as if giving Regulus the floor. Regulus rolled his eyes, irritated. He didn\u2019t quite have the same mouth as Sirius, Remus noticed. He had a weaker jaw, smaller lips. \u201cI mean\nalone\n,\u201d he said, shooting looks at James, Peter and Remus.\n\"No.\" Sirius said, simply. Regulus sighed. He clearly knew Sirius too well to try and argue.\nBarty Crouch's paper plane began spinning faster over their heads. Peter was watching it's progress anxiously.\n\"Fine.\" Regulus said, folding his arms. \"I just wanted to let you know that mother and father asked me and Narcissa to watch you. And report back to them.\"\nSirius made a noise of disgust. Regulus continued, not dropping his gaze, \"And we're not going to. We're both staying out of it, ok?\"\n\"How noble of you.\" Sirius replied. James grinned. Regulus rolled his eyes again.\n\"I'm telling you I'm\nnot your enemy\n, idiot. Nor is Narcissa. You can do whatever you like, that's between you and our parents.\"\n\"Good.\"\n\"Good.\"\nThe two brothers continued to stare each other down. If it had been James, he'd have broken into a smile, slapped Sirius on the shoulder and all would be forgotten. But Regulus was clearly just as pig-headed as Sirius, and couldn't tell when to end a fight.\n\"Ow!\" Peter let out a yelp like a whipped puppy, crouching down suddenly. Barty Crouch had obviously grown bored of the family drama and had decided to dive bomb the smallest of the marauders with his sharp paper plane. Crouch was giggling meanly as the place backed up and prepared for it's second attack, when James pulled out his own wand,\n\"\nIncendio\n.\" He said, lazily, flicking his wrist in Crouch's direction. The plane, wings now alight, went soaring towards the first year boy with frightening speed. Crouch let out a cry of anguish, covering his face with his arms as the flaming projectile flew straight for him \u2013 only to fizzle out mid-air, crumbling in a pile of ash and cinders inches from Crouch's nose.\n\"Let's go.\" Regulus muttered to his friend, who had gone pale and was staring at James warily. They both set off back towards the dungeons. \u201cNarcissa said to tell you good luck for Saturday, Potter.\u201d Regulus threw over his shoulder as they turned a corner.\nJames ignored him, following Sirius through the portrait hole. Once they were all in the common room Remus asked,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Saturday?\u201d\n\u201cQuidditch match. Gryffindor v Slytherin.\u201d James replied, promptly.\nAh. Remus was no good at keeping up with the quidditch schedule \u2013 he only went to Gryffindor matches, and the last one had fallen on the day after a full moon, so he\u2019d missed it anyway. He tended to tune out when the others started talking about tactics and league tables, burying his nose deeper in his book.\n\u201cI hope you thrash \u2018em, mate.\u201d Sirius growled, throwing himself into the nearest armchair.\n\"Plan to.\" James said, jovially, sitting on the arm of the chair. \"S'long as she doesn't get the snitch too early \u2013 and Marlene's the best beater we've had in years, so--\"\nJames stopped short, realising what he'd said. He looked at Sirius. Sirius groaned and stood up.\n\"I'm going to bed.\" He said.\n* * *\nSaturday 13\nth\nJanuary 1973\nIt had snowed overnight. If Hogwarts had been any normal school, Remus thought to himself grumpily, they would have called off the stupid match. But no; instead Gryffindor common room was buzzing with excitement, with talk of how these were 'perfect flying conditions'. Peter and Remus spent half the morning trying to cast long-lasting warming spells on James's kit. Sirius had done one of his early morning vanishing acts, and was nowhere to be seen.\nAdil Deshmakh, the Gryffindor team captain, made the team eat together at breakfast, rather than with their friends. They all sat there looking pale and tired, eating uniform bowls of porridge and fruit (on Deshmakh's orders). James was the only one in a good mood \u2013 even though they hadn't got the warming spell to work.\n\"Where's Sirius?\" Lily yawned, as she took a seat next to Remus, biting into a slice of heavily buttered toast.\n\"Dunno,\" Remus yawned back, hugging his hot cup of tea as if his life depended on it.\n\"Sulking somewhere, probably.\" Peter said, bitterly. Remus gave him a sharp look. \"What?!\" The blond haired boy frowned, indignantly. \"He calls\nme\nwhiny all the time.\"\n\"He'll be here.\" Remus said, ignoring Peter. \"He wants to see us destroy the Slytherins.\"\nEven Lily grinned at this \u2013 despite her usual pleas for inter-house unity, today she was decked out in red and gold from head to toe, just like everyone else. After breakfast they walked out to the quidditch pitch together. The Gryffindor quarter of the pitch was bedecked with red and gold flags and streamers, plus four large banners displaying the golden Gryffindor lion. Thankfully someone had also cleared the snow from the benches.\nLily and Peter wanted to get the best seats at the very top of the spectator stands, and Remus was already shivering despite wearing two jumpers under his cloak.\n\"Cold, Remus?\" Lily glanced at him, as he tried to blow hot air into his gloved hands.\n\"Just a bit.\" He replied, sarcastically, too bad tempered to be polite.\n\"Here,\" Lily pulled out her wand and grabbed his wrists, pointing into his palms; \"\nCalidum Vestimenta\n.\"\nAt once, a delightful warmth spread through his hands, to the very tips of his frozen fingers.\n\"How did you do that?!\" He asked, \"We've been trying all morning!\"\n\"I think it's in the annunciation.\" Lily shrugged. She quickly applied the same spell to Remus's cloak, then to Peter's.\nBy the time this was done, the two quidditch teams were gathering on the pitch, which had been cleared enough for them to make a path from their changing rooms at least. They stood in two neat rows \u2013 one scarlet, one emerald. Remus could clearly make out a few of the players \u2013 James's unmistakeable mop of jet black hair, Marlene's fluffy sandy blonde ponytail. He could also see Narcissa Black, on the opposing team; tall and willowy, her platinum hair woven into two neat braids which reached hallway down her back.\nStill no Sirius,\n\"Of course,\" Peter was blathering to Lily, \"We don't actually need to win this one, we just need to keep our points up \u2013 as long as we finish with at least six goals then we stay at the top of the league. Black's a brilliant seeker, but Slytherin overall are pretty poor. Especially when you look at James, having him's like having three chasers in one.\"\nLily was nodding along politely \u2013 people so seldom listened to Peter when it came to sport. Remus certainly didn't. He'd attempted to read Sirius' dog-eared copy of\nQuidditch through the Ages\n, but nothing in it could help him make sense of the ridiculous points system.\nMadam Hooch blew her whistle below them, and the players mounted their brooms, squatting ready for kick off.\nStill no Sirius.\nRemus craned his neck, looking around the stands \u2013 but even with his excellent eyesight, he couldn't spot his friend anywhere. Surely Peter wasn't right \u2013 he couldn't be off sulking somewhere? They'd thought he was over his rejection from the quidditch team \u2013 he'd been at every match that year to support James. Just because this particular match was against Slytherin...\nMadam Hooch blew her whistle again and released the snitch. The players shot into the air like red and green cannonballs.\nStill no Sirius.\nPeter and Lily were on their feet cheering with everyone else, so Remus got up too and attempted to look involved in the game. James had possession of the quaffle within seconds of being in the air, and had it through the hoop in under a minute. The red crowds exploded with triumph, but were quickly overshadowed by a deafening noise like a thunderclap,\n\"Rrrrrroooooaaaaar!\"\n\"What was that?!\" Lily stared about, wide eyed, along with everyone else. Even the players on the pitch looked startled. Remus looked up and saw that the lions in the Gryffindor banners above them appeared to have come to life, and were now prowling back and forth across the red material, growling and tossing their heads restlessly.\n\"Is that normal?\" He asked, pointing. Lily and Peter shook their heads, speechless, as the enormous lions roared above them.\nRemus smiled, suddenly. He recognised that magic; playful and a bit scary. \"Look!\" He pointed again.\nAt the bottom of the spectator\u2019s stands, nearest the ground, a young Gryffindor in bright red robes was also stalking back and forth, waving his wand like a conductor's baton. It was undoubtedly Sirius \u2013 who else had that over-confident strut? \u2013 but he was no longer bald, and had instead donned an enormous golden wig, like a lion's mane. Remus thought he could even see a gold tail dragging behind from under his robes.\nOnce everyone had seen him, the crowds laughed \u2013 even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. But Slytherin did not \u2013 the green coloured portion of the crowd merely glared at the garish show of house pride.\nJames was clearly not distracted by the new mascots, but instead encouraged by them \u2013 which must have been Sirius's intention. He scored at least three more goals \u2013 resulting in three more ear-splitting roars \u2013 while the Slytherins struggled to recover from the surprise.\n\"We are Gryffindor!\" Sirius was chanting, his voice magically amplified,\n\"Mighty Mighty Gryffindor!\" The crowd screamed back.\nOnce he got used to all of the noise, Remus began to enjoy a quidditch game for the first time. James was like a red blur on the pitch, darting this way and that; though the other chasers were very good too, managing to keep up with his complicated formations and passes. Marlene, bat in hand, was doing a stunning job of not only protecting the chasers and seeker, but aiming bludgers at the other team \u2013 Narcissa in particular.\nNarcissa Black, however, was in her own league. She had an elegant, smooth flying style that Remus recognised from Sirius's attempts to teach him formal flying. She was quick and always moving, like water. The Gryffindor seeker was following her movements, hoping she would lead him to the snitch, but she kept dodging and making false turns to confuse him; twice sending him directly into the path of a bludger. She wasn't showy like James \u2013 she was efficient and ruthless.\nGryffindor had a one hundred point lead when Narcissa finally saw the snitch \u2013 Remus noticed the moment she caught sight of it. Her posture changed; she didn't look away even once. She hovered for a few moments, glancing behind her to see where the Gryffindor seeker was. He was hanging back, unsure what she was planning.\nAt that very moment, Maisy Jackson, one of the Gryffindor chasers, scored another goal, bringing Gryffindor's score up to 130 against Slytherin's 20. The Gryffindors went wild, and Sirius waved his wand even more enthusiastically. The lions not only roared this time, but\nleapt\nclear through the banners, out into the winter air, where they became strange golden shadows striding across the pitch. The Gryffindor seeker dived to dodge them, clearly terrified, though they vanished just above his head.\n\"No, you idiot!\" Sirius's voice echoed over the cheering.\nIt was too late \u2013 Narcissa had taken advantage of her opponent's distraction and scooped up the snitch. She flew above the crowds, holding it aloft triumphantly. The Slytherin crowd finally burst into applause, sending up green and silver sparks, cheering;\n\"Black, Black, Black!\"\nOf course, this was highly confusing, as the Gryffindors were also chanting,\n\"Black, Black, Black!\" As Sirius took his bows before the crowd. James swooped down to land beside him and ruffled his friend's ridiculous mane, as the crowd now chanted, \"Pot-ter! Pot-ter! Pot-ter!\"\n\"Oh well,\" Peter grinned up at Remus, \"We lost, but we're still tied with Ravenclaw in the league table \u2013 still going through to the final!\"\nRemus couldn't care less.\nAfterwards they poured onto the pitch to congratulate their team \u2013 Remus and Peter both punched Sirius playfully,\n\"You never told us!\"\n\"We could have helped!\"\nSirius just smirked and tossed his glorious golden hair.\n\"Sirius!\" A thin, cold voice broke through the crowd. They all turned. Narcissa was striding towards them, still in her billowing emerald robes, a bright silver medal hanging around her neck that made Remus shrink back behind Peter. Sirius stood to face her. She gave him an unexpected smirk, \"Take off that obscene wig.\" She said sharply.\nHe complied, rubbing his bare head self-consciously. Narcissa pulled out her wand with one sweeping motion and tapped his head, \"\nCr\nescere\n.\"\nThe marauders, and the crowd of Gryffindor's around them all gasped. Sirius hair began to grow, like black water tumbling from his head, until it was back to its usual length.\n\"What the?!\" Sirius grabbed his head. Narcissa grinned, showing rows of pearly teeth,\n\"That's for your help in ensuring a Slytherin victory.\" With that, she turned, silver plaits whipping around, and flounced off towards her own team.\nJames tugged on Sirius's newly restored tresses.\n\"I'm never going to understand your bonkers family, mate.\""

            "content": "After the landmark Gryffindor vs. Slytherin game, it felt as though time was speeding up for Remus. Part of this was down to the balance having been restored to their dorm room. James was once again the hero, Sirius\u2019s rebellious streak was back in full flow, Peter was no longer treading on eggshells around either of them, and Remus had no peace and quiet at all \u2013 though could hardly complain about it.\nAs if trying to make up for lost time, James and Sirius tore through the final weeks of winter with a renewed zest for pranks and mischief. They spent half of their time under the invisibility cloak, casting hexes at unsuspecting students in the halls, raiding the kitchens and causing upset in the dining hall. At least three or four nights a week they crept out together with Remus\u2019s map to plot the castle \u2013 though most of the time they returned with armfuls of sweets from Honeyduke\u2019s instead. Peter often tried to tag along, but Remus needed all the sleep he could get.\nHis January and February full moons were not good. Neither was quite so bad as the December moon that had left him so obviously scarred, but neither were at all pleasant. Madam Pomfrey was relentless in her quest to find a solution \u2013 in January she tried vanishing his fingernails (\u2018\nonly temporarily, you understand, you\u2019ll have them back in the morning\n\u2019) but it did not stop his claws from growing in once the transformation took hold. Remus was somewhat relieved by this, as she\u2019d had plans to vanish his teeth next.\nIn February, she tried securing his arms and legs with magical manacles to stop him from hurting himself. She was extremely apologetic about these measures \u2013 even more so when she returned in the morning to find that he had dislocated both shoulders breaking free of the shackles. He was too tired to care very much.\nWhile engaging in less pranks than he had the year before, Remus chose to throw himself into his studies. Secretly, Remus hoped to take advantage of Sirius and James\u2019s determination\nnot\nto focus on their schoolwork. He wanted to come top in History of Magic again, and knew he had a good chance \u2013 not just that; his marks had been getting better and better in Transfiguration, Herbology and Astrology too, and he at least had the chance to be in the top three.\nCharms and Potions still belonged to Lily Evans, but he wanted to close the gap between them as much as possible. As such, he finally overcame his fear of the library, and spent almost every free hour he had in there, completing essays and revising. His reading had improved a fair bit \u2013 he was still slow if he didn\u2019t use the spell, but he found that his constant practice helped him recognise the letters much faster than before.\nLily was often in the library too, and after a few days of nodding politely to each other across the desks, Lily gathered up her things and came to sit next to him. They got along very well together, either reading quietly or querying each other on various points.\nInevitably, Lily was the second person after Sirius to discover Remus\u2019s secret.\n\u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d She asked, looking at him curiously.\n\u201cDo what?\u201d\n\u201cEvery time you open a new book, you put your hand on it and scratch your head with your wand.\u201d\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t.\u201d Remus put his wand down, guiltily.\n\u201cYes, you do.\u201d Lily said, calmly, a small smile playing on her lips, \u201cYou muttered something, too. Was it a spell?\u201d\n\u201cUm.\u201d\n\u201cOh go on, tell me \u2013 is it something to do with the books? Is it how you figure everything out quicker than me?!\u201d\nRemus was so pleased by this compliment that he dropped his guard for once.\n\u201cPromise you won\u2019t tell anyone?\u201d\n\u201cPromise.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s to help me read. I\u2019m not\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026 um\u2026 well I find it harder than everyone else. Reading the normal way.\u201d\n\u201cWow! How does it work?!\u201d Her eyes grew wider, as they always did when she was excited about something. Remus was surprised \u2013 she didn\u2019t seem at all interested to hear that he couldn\u2019t read normally.\n\u201cLike this,\u201d he showed her. She copied him, but looked disappointed,\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to do.\u201d He explained, \u201cTook me ages to get it right.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did you find out about it? That\u2019s really, really advanced stuff!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t \u2013 Sirius did. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s written down anywhere, it sounded more like he bunged a few different spells together. Probably why it\u2019s a bit clunky.\u201d\n\u201cReally?!\u201d If Lily\u2019s eyes got any wider they were in danger of falling out of her head. \u201cI\nknew\nhe was cleverer than he acts in lessons! Ooh, that git! Show me again!\u201d\nAs well as Lily, Remus often found that he was joined by her friends, Mary and Marlene. At first he was unsure about this arrangement \u2013 he usually tried to avoid the other girls in his year purely out of instinct. Plus, the two M\u2019s were generally to be found giggling at the back of the class or fawning over some wizard celebrity in the common room. However, he was pleasantly surprised to find that both girls took their studies just as seriously as he did \u2013 and in fact that their interest in wizard pop stars was hardly different from Sirius and James\u2019s obsession with their favourite quidditch teams.\nMary was particularly nice to talk to \u2013 she was muggleborn and from south London; her accent made Remus feel strangely at home. She was unpretentious and had a broad smile and a loud, infectious laugh. Marlene was slightly quieter, but hysterically funny and able to mimic almost anyone in the school \u2013 including the teachers. Her McGonagall was spectacular; Remus actually cried with laughter.\nThe three girls were exceptionally kind to Remus, and he knew this was mostly because they thought he was ill. He didn\u2019t mind though, because he was learning plenty of interesting things from them. For one, Mary had a spell for covering up blemishes \u2013 which didn\u2019t\ncompletely\nvanish his scars, but noticeably reduced their appearance. He\u2019d never even thought to look in a beauty magazine for a solution.\nThey introduced him to various other girly things \u2013 Mary had a crush on Sirius, and Marlene on James. Remus thought they were both completely mad and wondered if they\u2019d feel the same way if\nthey\nhad to share a bathroom with Potter and Black.\nIn return, Remus helped them with History of Magic, since he was apparently the only student in the whole school who actually found Professor Binns interesting. Marlene was excellent as Astronomy, and showed him how to plot his constellations using some clever mnemonic devices.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so nice, Remus,\u201d Mary said, in her usual blunt manner one evening as they walked back to the common room together, \u201cMarlene and Lily were proper scared of you in first year.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Remus almost dropped his books in surprise.\n\u201cMary, don\u2019t be so rude!\u201d Marlene hissed.\n\u201cYou\nwere\npretty aggressive,\u201d Lily explained, \u201cAnd James started telling everyone you were really rough, and that you were in a gang.\u201d\nRemus snorted with laughter.\nAs they entered the common room, he quickly spied Sirius, James and Peter huddled in a corner, pouring over a very large, very thick book. Marlene and Mary burst into fits of giggles when they saw them, and ran upstairs. Lily shared a knowing look with Remus before following them.\nThe marauders looked up as their friend approached, and Peter very conspicuously covered the book they were reading with some sheets of parchment.\n\u201cAlright lads?\u201d Remus said, craning his neck, \u201cWhat you doing?\u201d\n\u201cNothing!\u201d James said, brightly, \u201cWhere\u2019ve you been?\u201d\n\u201cIn the library,\u201d Sirius stated, before Remus could even open his mouth, \u201cWith his\nfan club\n.\u201d\nRemus smirked,\n\u201cPiss off Black, I know when you\u2019re jealous.\u201d He had elected not to tell his friends that Marlene and Mary fancied them. Their egos might not be able to handle much more inflating. Anyway, he didn\u2019t want to change the topic, \u201cSeriously, what you hiding there?\u201d\nAll three looked at each other guiltily, and Remus felt a sting of hurt. They were all up to something without him \u2013 he ought to have known. He supposed it was only fair \u2013 he had refused to take part in any pranks for so long that now they didn\u2019t want to include him at all.\n\u201cYour birthday!\u201d Peter suddenly burst out. \u201cIt\u2019s coming up.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus scratched his head, thrown, \u201cNext week.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re planning a surprise!\u201d Peter said, grinning widely, clearly very pleased with himself. Remus did not miss James\u2019s look of annoyance, and he knew at once that Peter was lying. Fine. If they didn\u2019t want to tell him.\n\u201cOh, right,\u201d He swallowed, forcing a smile, \u201cWell you\u2019d better not be planning to embarrass me like last year.\u201d\n\u201cOh no, never!\u201d Sirius grinned, standing up, gathering the book to his chest, title still hidden, \u201cAre we the sort of friends that would want to\nembarrass\nyou, Lupin?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you are.\u201d Remus nodded, slowly, narrowing his eyes, \u201cNo singing. No big parties. Nothing that\u2019s going to\u2014\u201c\n\u201cGet you into trouble,\nwe know\n,\u201d James finished, standing up too. \u201cHey, why don\u2019t we invite your new friends, eh? Do us good to mix with the fairer sex, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Sirius tossed his hair, \u201cMore like you want a chance to get Evans on her own.\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you.\u201d James replied, cheeks slightly pinker than usual.\n* * *\n\u201cSo if you\u2019re\nnot\nin a gang,\u201d Mary mused, a few days later. They were checking each other\u2019s Herbology essays and Mary was the fastest reader so she\u2019d already finished. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get all the cuts and bruises?\u201d\n\u201cPet rabbit,\u201d Remus replied, still reading Marlene\u2019s essay, \u201cVicious temper.\u201d\nLily grinned at him.\n\u201cOh yeah? I thought you lived in a home?\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d He said, coolly, \u201cWe\u2019re allowed pets.\u201d That was somewhat true \u2013 there had been goldfish, for a time, until the tank got overturned by one of the older boys in a rage.\n\u201cOh, in a children\u2019s home?\u201d Mary looked up, \u201cAre you muggleborn too?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Marlene said, promptly, \u201c\u2019Lupin\u2019s\u2019 a wizard name \u2013 your dad?\u201d She looked at him for confirmation. He nodded, unsettled.\n\u201cYeah, how did you know?\u201d\n\u201cI saw the name on a trophy.\u201d\n\u201cA\u2026 trophy?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Can\u2019t remember what for, I think it was outside the Ravenclaw common room.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right.\u201d He had never so much as glanced at any of the trophies except for the Quidditch Cup, which James stopped to pay homage to at least once a week. He was suddenly filled with an irrepressible urge to run all the way to the Ravenclaw corridor, and dropped the essay he was reading.\nLily was watching him.\n\u201cGo, Remus,\u201d she said softly, taking the parchment from him. The other two girls were looking at him too, somewhat pityingly. They nodded. He practically leapt up.\nHe wasn\u2019t sure exactly what he\u2019d expected. He could barely read for a few moments; he was so out of breath from sprinting up three flights of stairs. The case was mahogany and glass, regularly polished by Filch \u2013 or the house elves, he supposed. It was stuffed full of trophies and awards for a hundred different achievements.\nWizard Chess Champion, Triwizard Tournament Victor, Droobles Best Bubble Gum Blowing Finalist.\nAnd there it was. A huge, golden statuette depicting a wizard raising his wand in a silly looking stance, as if he was serving a tennis ball.\nLyall Lupin, Hogwarts Duelling Champion, 1946.\nHe stared at it for a very long time, reading and re-reading. He tried to think logically. This only confirmed things he already knew. His father was in Ravenclaw \u2013 McGonagall had told him that in his first year. He was good at duelling \u2013 exceptionally good, apparently. Both Slughorn and drunken old Darius had told him that. Really, all this did was confirm that his father had been at Hogwarts \u2013 he had\nbelonged\nat Hogwarts. Had probably touched that very trophy. Remus pressed his fingers against the glass as if he could break through and grasp it."

            "content": "Saturday 10\nth\nMarch 1973\nThe marauders could not have been happier to discover that Remus\u2019s birthday occurred on a Saturday that year. This, in their opinion, opened up the day to all sorts of excitement that would simply not be possible on a weekday.\nAs the day approached, Remus tried to ignore their teasing and heavy handed hints about what lay in store. He didn\u2019t mind what they did, he trusted them well enough \u2013 they could be relied upon to make a fool of themselves, but they had so far never made him the butt of the joke. James had been receiving strange lumpy packages bound up in brown paper for the past week and Remus\u2019s only hope was that they weren\u2019t presents for him \u2013 he\u2019d never be able to return the favour.\nRemus thought a lot about being thirteen \u2013 specifically being a thirteen-year-old wizard with a furry little problem. The discovery of the Ravenclaw trophy cabinet had done some very strange things to Remus\u2019s internal dialogue. He\u2019d always thought he had a pretty good idea of who he was \u2013 a care home kid, poor, a bit weedy, angry, bad, scarred, thick when it came to school stuff, but clever enough when it counted. Coming to Hogwarts had wrought some changes, of course \u2013 maybe he wasn\u2019t\nthat\nthick, even if he was still sure of everything else.\nHis father had been\nreally\nclever. He was in Ravenclaw, after all. The sorting hat had considered Remus for Ravenclaw too, but changed its mind. That hadn\u2019t meant a great deal to him at the time, but now he wondered and wondered about it. What if he\u2019d been sorted into Ravenclaw? Would he know more, now about his father? About who he was?\nWhat if his father had not killed himself? What if he had never been bitten at all? \u2018What if\u2019 was a dangerous game.\nAs he fell asleep on the night before his birthday, Remus slipped into a dream he had not had in a very long time.\n\nHe is lying in a bed in a small, pale blue room. It is summer and the sash window is wide open; curtains billowing. The window is huge \u2013 big enough for a grown man to get through. Remus is very small and very frightened.\n\nThere is someone in the room with him, and they are going to hurt him. It\u2019s a monster \u2013 his mother promised they weren\u2019t real, but oh! Oh, she\u2019s a liar, a horrid liar, because there\nis\na monster, and it\u2019s crossing the room now; it\u2019s coming towards him and it will eat him up!\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s afraid of the big bad wolf?\u201d\n\n\nHe scrunches his eyes shut and ducks under the covers and trembles and sobs,\n\n\nThen\u2026 then there is nothing \u2013 nothing solid, nothing real. He is in pain, there is so much blood and so many tears and an awful lot of noise. He just wants to sleep. Another man looms over him, tall and slender and worried.\n\n\n\u201cDaddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cLUMOS MAXIMA!\u201d\nRemus started awake with a jolt, nearly crying out. The dorm room had filled with bright, unnatural light, it sliced through his bed curtains, making him squint. He just had time to wipe the tears from his cheeks before Sirius and James ripped back the heavy drapes, chanting,\n\u201cHappy Birthday, Lupin!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s still dark out, you pricks.\u201d He squinted, rubbing his eyes and sitting up. He tried to will his heart to stop pounding so hard.\n\u201cIt is\nprecisely\none minute past midnight,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cand therefore officially your thirteenth birthday.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Pete?\u201d Remus climbed out of bed, stepping into the room. They had decorated it haphazardly with streamers which he was sure usually decked out the quidditch pitch on match days, and strings of fairy lights left over from Christmas.\n\u201cOn a mission.\u201d James said, eyes twinkling. \u201cC\u2019mon, up and dressed.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n\u201cNowhere,\u201d Sirius replied, breezily, \u201cBut you\u2019ll want to be properly attired for when your guests arrive.\u201d\n\u201cMy guests?!\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Sirius grinned, \u201cWe tried to keep it marauders only, but so many people wanted to celebrate with you, see.\u201d\nRemus couldn\u2019t tell if Sirius was being sarcastic, so he chose not to respond, instead pulling on a pair of jeans and a long-sleeved t-shirt that looked clean enough. By the time he had dressed, there was a sharp rap at the door,\n\u201cCome in!\u201d James boomed, cheerfully. Sirius saw Remus\u2019s wince and explained,\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, we put a silencing spell on the room.\u201d\nRemus frowned,\n\u201cSo\u2026 whoever\u2019s on the other side of that door can\u2019t actually hear us?\u201d\nJames clapped his hand to his forehead,\n\u201cWe are complete idiots.\u201d He groaned at Sirius, pulling open the door.\nPeter stood outside, looking very pleased and very pink, surrounded by Lily, Marlene and Mary. Remus gaped as they entered the room, all smiling widely and clearly thrilled that they had surprised him. They were all clutching cards and small packages too.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think girls were allowed in here?\u201d\n\u201cThe lovely Mary tested it for us last week \u2013 nothing bad seems to happen,\u201d James explained.\n\u201cOne day you\u2019ll all read\nHogwarts: A History\n, and I can finally rest.\u201d Sirius sighed, shaking his head tragically.\nJames had begun pulling out packages from under his bed, ripping them open. It seemed they had raided Honeyduke\u2019s again \u2013 mountains of sweets were unearthed; Bertie Bott\u2019s Every Flavour Beans, Chocolate Frogs, Fizzing Whizzbees, Droobles Best Blowing Gum, sherbet lemons, cauldron cakes \u2013 not to mention the haul Peter had brought up from the kitchen; ham sandwiches, egg mayonnaise, coronation chicken, cheese and pickle, packets of Remus\u2019s favourite flavour crisps\u2013 salt and vinegar \u2013 scotch eggs, sausage rolls, pork pies, cheese and pineapple sticks, plus some perfunctory fruit.\nSirius, meanwhile, was laying blankets over the floorboards and scattering a few plush velvet cushions,\n\u201cLupin,\u201d he said with a wide smile, \u201cWelcome to your midnight feast!\u201d\n\u201cHappy birthday, Remus!\u201d The girls chanted, as one.\nThey all sat down together, and Sirius settled a record onto his player \u2013 he\u2019d eventually opened his gifts from Andromeda \u2013 as requested, he received two Bowie albums:\nHunky Dory\nand\nThe Man Who Sold the World\n.\n\u201cSit next to me, Sirius,\u201d Mary said, quickly, earning a reproachful look from Marlene. Sirius shrugged and acquiesced, but leaned over to hand Remus a package,\n\u201cOpen this first!\u201d\nIt was long and cylindrical, very light and badly wrapped.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to get me anything.\u201d Remus mumbled, untwisting the ends.\n\u201cA poster?\u201d Lily furrowed her brow, watching as Remus unfurled the thick glossy paper. It was a huge, A2 print of David Bowie in black and white, wearing a spangly silver costume and giving a slightly jerky high kick.\n\u201cI got Andromeda to send it to me at Christmas,\u201d Sirius grinned, unable to contain himself, \u201cBut I enchanted it to move myself!\u201d\n\u201cWow!\u201d Remus smiled back, sincerely, \u201cThanks! It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\nThe girls had all got him packets of sweets and cakes \u2013 and Lily gave him a book on Potions. He looked at her sceptically and she grinned,\n\u201cCan\u2019t keep giving Severus a reason to lord it over you.\u201d\n\u201cPlease do not mention Snivellus\u2019s name on this most sacred occasion.\u201d James said with mock horror. Lily rolled her eyes and returned to her jam tart, conspicuously ignoring him. James seemed hardly to notice, just cleared his throat and looked at Remus, his dark eyes full of wickedness, \u201cMy present is coming later\u2026 once we\u2019ve all stuffed ourselves to bursting.\u201d\n\u201cOh Merlin, Potter,\u201d Marlene giggled, \u201cWhat have you got planned?\u201d\nHe would not tell.\nRemus had to admit that he was enjoying himself \u2013 he had hoped that James and Sirius would respect his wishes and keep the celebrations to marauders only, but inviting the girls wasn\u2019t too bad. He knew them all quite well, now, and actually quite enjoyed their company. Mary could give Sirius a run for his money when it came to barefaced cheek and, as Remus had predicted, Marlene\u2019s impressions of the faculty members had the marauders in stitches \u2013 Peter even had to go and change his shirt after snorting pumpkin juice down himself.\n\u201cStarting to see why Remus\u2019s been abandoning us for you lot.\u201d James said at about one thirty, wiping tears of laughter from the corners of his eyes.\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re not bad, for girls,\u201d Sirius winked at Mary, who scoffed and gave him a playful shove.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s got nothing to do with me wanting to get my homework done.\u201d Remus replied dryly, wondering if he could manage another chocolate frog.\n\u201cOh, how times have changed,\u201d Sirius said, haughtily.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll all be laughing on the other sides of your faces when Remus beats you all in our exams.\u201d Lily quipped.\n\u201cPah!\u201d James got up, stretching elaborately as if about to perform some great feat, \u201cExams! We marauders have\nhigher\nconcerns. My dear Mr Black, Mr Pettigrew,\u201d he made a sweeping gesture towards the dorm window, \u201cShall we?\u201d\n\u201cBy George!\u201d Sirius stood, abruptly, \u201cIs it time?!\u201d\nJames closed his eyes solemnly and nodded,\n\u201cIndeed it is.\u201d\n\u201cThen make haste!\u201d Peter cried, standing up too.\nThe girls shot nervous glances at each other and then Remus, who could only shrug to show them he had no idea. Sirius, Peter and James went to the window, flinging it open. They were fidgeting from excitement, lack of sleep and too much sugar, and kept snickering like naughty children.\n\u201cCome on!\u201d Peter beckoned the others, hurriedly, \u201cYou\u2019ll want to see!\u201d\nJames had produced a collection of bright red objects which looked like a cross between space rockets and stick of dynamite. His arms were full, and so were Sirius\u2019s.\n\u201cAre those\u2026\u201d Marlene scrunched up her nose, \u201cNot Dr Filibuster\u2019s?!\u201d\nJames just gave a maniacal smile.\n\u201cOh no!\u201d Lily said, \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to! You\u2019ll wake up the whole castle!\u201d\n\u201cGet lost if you don\u2019t like it, Evans,\u201d Sirius snapped, handing a few rockets to Peter, \u201cYou promised not to spoil anything.\u201d\n\u201cRemus,\u201d Lily turned to him, \u201cTell them, they\u2019ll listen to you!\u201d\n\u201cNo they won\u2019t,\u201d Remus replied, \u201cAnyway, I want to see! I\u2019ve never seem wizard fireworks.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re in for a treat!\u201d Sirius winked.\n\u201cHow many do you need?!\u201d Mary stared, sounding impressed.\n\u201cThirteen, obviously.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re all going to get in so much trouble\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, stop being such a goody goody, Lil!\u201d Marlene threw her arm around the redhead.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t let any of you girls get in trouble.\u201d James said, sincerely, his glasses slipping down his nose as he struggled to keep control of his cargo. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried.\u201d Lily folded her arms defiantly. \u201cI just think you\u2019re all being\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOoops!\u201d\n*\nBANG\n*\n\u201cPeter!\u201d\nThey all leaned out of the window to see the rocket Peter had dropped tumbling down towards to ground in a torrent of green and gold sparks.\n\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d Peter looked sheepish. Sirius laughed,\n\u201cNo, great work \u2013 now we\u2019ve started we may as well continue, eh?\u201d and he began to hurl his own fireworks out of the window, clear into the night air. James and Peter quickly followed suit and soon enough even Lily had forgotten to be annoyed as they all stared in awe at the spectacular display lighting up the starry sky.\nThe fireworks went on much longer than muggle ones, some bursting ten or twelve times before fizzling out. They changed colours from red to green to purple to orange, twisting and curling in various shapes, eventually spelling out \u2018HAPPY THIRTEENTH BIRTHDAY REMU\u2019.\nSirius sighed, irritated at that,\n\u201cKnew it was too many letters.\u201d\nAs well as the dazzling light display, the fireworks were satisfactorily noisy, so much so that Remus could already hear the other Gryffindor\u2019s in the tower opening their windows to see whether the castle was under attack. He was sure he heard whoever was in the room above theirs mutter,\n\u201cThem bloody marauders are at it again.\u201d\nInevitably, someone began hammering at their door, and McGonagall\u2019s shrill voice could be heard on the other side,\n\u201cPotter! Black! Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know you\u2019re behind this, OPEN THIS DOOR!\u201d\n\u201cOh shit!\u201d James grimaced, \u201cBetter get under the beds, ladies\u2026\u201d\nOnce they had all been thoroughly reprimanded, promised two months of detention and letters home to all of their parents, McGonagall (who was a sight to behold in her red tartan nightie) left them and Marlene, Lily and Mary reluctantly returned to their own dormitory. It was two o\u2019clock in the morning by then, and the boys decided it was finally time for bed.\n\u201cHappy birthday, Remus,\u201d Peter called out, followed by a loud yawn.\nRemus smiled to himself in the dark, his cheeks almost aching.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius yawned back, \u201cHappy birthday, Remu.\u201d"

            "content": "Monday 19\nth\nMarch 1973\n\u201cI have a spot of good news,\u201d Madam Pomfrey smiled warmly, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to mention it in case we couldn\u2019t sort things out in time \u2013 but you\u2019ll be seeing me over the summer.\u201d\nFor a moment, Remus dared hope that this meant he was not going back to St Edmund\u2019s, but the medi-witch continued, \u201cMrs Orwell, your matron at the children\u2019s home, has kindly permitted me to apparate onto the grounds at dawn following both full moons this summer.\u201d She smiled widely.\nAh well. It was better than nothing. He smiled back weakly,\n\u201cGreat!\u201d He croaked. His arms and legs felt heavy as lead, he could barely raise his head to drink the potion she was offering him.\nIt was about four o\u2019clock in the afternoon and Remus had missed his lessons \u2013 he\u2019d been asleep most of the day. Sleep was still the only remedy that seemed to really work.\n\u201cI told Dumbledore I would do it with or without his permission \u2013 I couldn\u2019t live with myself if you arrived here in September in the same state you did last year.\u201d\n\u201cI could stay at a wizard\u2019s house this summer, that would be even safer,\u201d Remus tried, \u201cMy friend James\u2014\u201c\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear,\u201d Madam Pomfrey shook her head, \u201cIt\u2019s just not safe enough. The Potters did get in touch, but we need to preserve your anonymity for as long as we can \u2013 I know it isn\u2019t much fun for you, but it\u2019s better you stay with muggles.\u201d\nRemus closed his eyes and took a deep breath. It would only be two months, and the summer was still ages away.\nStay positive, stay positive\n.\nA sudden clattering noise at the end of the ward jerked Remus out of his meditative chant. Madam Pomfrey frowned and turned to look around Remus\u2019s bed curtain.\n\u201cMr Pettigrew!\u201d She shouted, \u201cWhat do you think you are doing?!\u201d\n\u201cS-s-sorry Madam Pomfrey \u2013 we were just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPick those bedpans up right now and put them back in the cupboard! And you can wipe that smirk off your face, Mr Black, give him a hand.\u201d\n\u201cHiya, Remu,\u201d James peeked around the curtain, \u201cSorry about all the noise.\u201d\nRemus grinned, trying to sit up.\n\u201cS\u2019ok.\u201d\n\u201cLie down!\u201d Madam Pomfey chastised, \u201cYou\u2019ve had three broken bones you silly boy.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling much better!\u201d\n*CRASH*\n\u201cMR PETTIGREW, WHAT DID I SAY?!\u201d Madam Pomfrey disappeared, looking very cross.\nJames slumped into the chair beside Remus\u2019s bed.\n\u201cReady to go?\u201d He asked, casually. Remus could always count on James not to treat him like an invalid.\n\u201cIf she\u2019ll let me,\u201d Remus nodded to the curtain Pomfrey had vanished behind. \u201cHow was the match?\u201d\n\u201cSmashed it,\u201d James nodded enthusiastically, dropping the snitch into Remus\u2019s lap. He ran his fingers through his hair as if to regain that feeling of having just touched down. \u201cMade one of the Ravenclaw beaters cry.\u201d\n\u201cHow nice.\u201d\n\u201cHow was\u2026 y\u2019know, your night?\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Remus replied dryly, twisting his mouth. They didn\u2019t often talk about the full moons \u2013 and Remus was pretty glad about that. He didn\u2019t like the idea of them knowing too much. Pain was a personal thing.\n\u201cThree broken bones, did she say?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. All fixed now though, she\u2019s amazing, only takes one spell. Muggles have to wear plaster casts for weeks and weeks.\u201d\n\u201cWeird!\u201d\n\u201cREMU!\u201d Sirius whipped back the curtain, \u201cYou\u2019re ALIVE!\u201d He fell dramatically at the foot of the bed, \u201cI was convinced she was trying to cover something up, the old bat wouldn\u2019t let us come over.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call her that,\u201d Remus replied, irritably, \u201cAnd don\u2019t call\nme\nthat!\u201d\n\u201cBut you wanted a nickname,\u201d Sirius said, sounding affronted as he climbed back to his feet. Peter appeared, looking sullen with his hands in his pockets.\n\u201cNo I didn\u2019t.\u201d Remus frowned, \u201cWhen did I ever say th\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLast year.\u201d Sirius said quickly, \u201cAlmost exactly a year ago, you said you wouldn\u2019t mind being called anything as long as it wasn\u2019t Loony Lupin.\u201d\n\u201cGod, you\u2019ve got a memory like an elephant.\u201d Remus rolled his eyes. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he lowered his voice, in case Madam Pomfrey was lurking nearby, \u201cThe whole point of having a nickname was so no one knew who wrote the map. I don\u2019t think \u2018Remu\u2019 is going to fool anyone.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a point, there.\u201d James said, wisely, \u201cAs much fun as it\u2019s been.\u201d\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d Sirius heaved a sigh, \u201cBut can we call you Remu until we come up with something better?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cBoring.\u201d Sirius cast around for something else to say, conspicuously avoiding looking at Remus\u2019s bandages. \u201cSo are we getting out of here or shall I settle down for a rousing game of snap?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d Madam Pomfrey bustled in, \u201cI\u2019m keeping Mr Lupin in for observation overnight.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Remus protested, \u201cI\u2019m feeling much better!\u201d He always said that \u2013 it wasn\u2019t usually true, but he knew he\nwould\nstart to feel better eventually, and it didn\u2019t much matter whether he was in the hospital wing or not.\n\u201cI\u2019m not being deliberately unkind, Remus,\u201d the nurse sighed, \u201cThis is for your health.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll go straight to bed!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll look after him!\u201d James said, earnestly, standing up. Remus waited to see if that worked, James was good with grown-ups, especially witches. He\u2019d even been known to soften McGonagall once or twice (though that might have been more to do with his quidditch skills).\nMadam Pomfrey was unmoved.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr Potter, but no.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Peter said, uncharacteristically firmly. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay here then.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Sirius and James said, as one.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll miss dinner!\u201d Remus said.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we can arrange something just this once.\u201d Madam Pomfrey said, trying not to smile. \u201cAll right, boys \u2013 but you\u2019re to keep quiet. And get on with your homework, I\u2019ll not have you using Mr Lupin here as an excuse for not handing anything in.\u201d\nWith a wave of her wand three more chairs appeared out of thin air, along with a long pinewood desk, complete with inkwells for their quills. Remus opened his mouth to speak, but Madam Pomfrey was apparently psychic \u2013 \u201cAnd no, Remus, no homework for you. Just rest.\u201d\nRemus shut his mouth and lay back down. How was he supposed to keep ahead of Sirius and James if the woman wouldn\u2019t let him study?\n\u201cCan I read my book?\u201d He asked, meekly.\n\u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t strain your eyes.\u201d\nShe left, and the other three boys dutifully pulled out their homework and began scribbling. Remus craned his neck to try and see what they were working on \u2013 he was all up to date with his, but had been doing some extra reading in Charms in an attempt to defeat Lily in their upcoming exams.\n\u201cAh ah ah,\u201d James covered his work with his sleeve, \u201cNo looking, Remu, you just rest.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, call me Loony!\u201d Remus groaned, \u201c\nAnything\nbut Remu!\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s suits you!\u201d Sirius said, over his quill, \u201cReeeeemuuuuuu.\u201d\n\u201cStop it or I\u2019ll bite you.\u201d\n\u201cReeeeemuuuu.\u201d\n\u201cReeeemuuu!\u201d Peter joined in, all three boys giggling hysterically, but trying not to be heard.\n\u201cI hate my name.\u201d Remus covered his face with the book he was reading. It wasn\u2019t fair \u2013\nJames Potter\nwas so reassuringly ordinary;\nPeter Pettigrew\nwas perfectly respectable and\nSirius\nBloody\nBlack\nwas the coolest name ever, whichever way you looked at it. \u201cYou might as well call me anything you like, I dunno what could be worse.\u201d\n\u201cLoony Remu?\u201d James suggested, helpfully. \u201cRemoony?\u201d\nSirius could hardly breathe from laughing now.\n\u201cREMOONY!\u201d He snorted, collapsing onto his desk, shoulders shaking.\n\u201cMoony is actually quite good.\u201d Peter suddenly said, very soberly.\n\u201cEh?\u201d\n\u201cMoony. As a nickname.\u201d\nRemus stared at him, unaccustomed to paying very much attention to anything Peter said. He thought about it, rolling the name around in his head. It sounded like Loony, but it was nowhere near as horrible.\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate it.\u201d He said, finally.\n\u201cI love it.\u201d James said, \u201cMoony. Suits you.\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t people\u2026 y\u2019know, catch on?\u201d He worried, chewing his lip.\n\u201cNah,\u201d Sirius waved a hand, \u201cWe\u2019ll tell them it\u2019s after that muggle in The Who.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re all muggles in The Who.\u201d Remus replied, \u201cBut I don\u2019t play the drums.\u201d\n\u201cYou like hitting things.\u201d Sirius shrugged.\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem, Remoony.\u201d\n* * *\nSome hours later, after Madam Pomfrey had brought them all dinner, James had left for quidditch practice and Peter for a detention. Sirius had given up on his homework long ago and was instead attempting to perfect a tentacle arms jinx on himself.\nRemus was stalwartly ignoring this behaviour \u2013 he knew that Sirius was pronouncing the incantation all wrong, with the emphasis in the wrong place \u2013 but he wasn\u2019t going to tell him, because he wasn\u2019t sure exactly\nwhy\nSirius wanted a tentacle arm so badly, and it couldn\u2019t be for any good reason.\nEventually, bored, Sirius leaned back on his chair, feet propped up on Remus\u2019s bed.\n\u201cWhat you reading, anyway?\u201d\n\u201c\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh\n.\u201d Remus supplied, turning the page. He was nearly at the end, and his reading spell was waning \u2013 if Sirius would just leave him alone for five more minutes\u2026\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it about?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s yours!\u201d He said, surprised, \u201cI got it off your shelf!\u201d\n\u201cOh, one of the muggle ones? I haven\u2019t read many of them, to be honest. They were my uncle Alphard\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cSo what, Black?!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it about?\u201d\n\u201cA man called Gilgamesh.\u201d\n\u201cOk, you have to agree that\u2019s a worse name than Remus Lupin.\u201d\nRemus chuckled,\n\u201cYeah, all right. It could always be worse.\u201d\n\u201cSo tell me about this Goulash bloke.\u201d\n\u201cGilgamesh. He was a king. A long time ago.\u201d\n\u201cSee, now I\u2019m hooked, that\u2019s how all good stories start.\u201d Sirius cupped his head in his hands, staring at Remus as if he was a professor teaching Sirius\u2019s favourite subject.\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re just putting off your Astrology essay.\u201d\n\u201cPfft, I\u2019ll copy James\u2019s.\u201d Sirius waved a casual hand, \u201cTell me more, oh keeper of knowledge. I\u2019ve read to\nyou\nplenty of times.\u201d\nRemus sighed, putting down the book. There was no getting out of it when Sirius was in this sort of a mood.\n\u201cGilgamesh was a king.\u201d\n\u201cYes, a long time ago, you\u2019ve established that.\u201d\n\u201cLook, shut up or piss off.\u201d\n\u201cOk, ok!\u201d Sirius held up his hands in surrender, \u201cCarry on.\u201d\n\u201cSo he was a king, but not a good one. He wasn\u2019t fully human \u2013 he was two thirds god, so he was stronger than everyone else and his people were frightened of him. He was dangerous. So, his people prayed \u2013 um\u2026 that\u2019s when you ask the gods for help \u2013 and the gods sent another man to help control Gilgamesh.\u201d\n\u201cWas he even stronger?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but he was part animal,\u201d\n\u201cSo this beast-man killed Gilgamesh?\u201d\n\u201cNo. They fought each other for a really long time, but Gilgamesh still won. He didn\u2019t kill Enkidu, though \u2013 he\u2026 he sort of recognised that they were equals. And they become friends \u2013 best friends. They have all these adventures together, fighting other monsters and stuff. It\u2019s cool.\u201d\n\u201cI want to know more about the beast-man.\u201d\n\u201cEnkidu. He was master of the animals, and he was happy living in the wild, but then after he\u2019s sent to control Gilgamesh he can\u2019t ever go back to nature. So he never really belongs.\u201d\n\u201cBut he had his friend, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026 well I don\u2019t want to spoil the ending for you.\u201d\n\u201cS\u2019ok, I hardly ever read muggle stuff.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re missing so much!\u201d Remus exclaimed, \u201cWell, ok then. Enkidu dies.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s sort of sad, he was my favourite character too.\u201d\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\n\u201cTo teach Gilgamesh about death, I think. Before Enkidu he was too arrogant to believe anything could hurt him. But after he loses him, he realises that he\u2019s not the master of everything. No one can control death.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a really depressing thought, Moony.\u201d\nRemus shrugged. It had all seemed pretty straightforward to him."

It was by turns bright and happy \u2013 then dark and introspective. He felt that David Bowie must have some super human insight into his soul. Even if he didn\u2019t always fully understand the lyrics, he felt as though they somehow made sense.\nHe hummed the tune to\nChanges\nquietly under his breath as he walked up and down the dark library shelves, his wand lit for a better look. He really ought to be catching up on Potions \u2013 but Lily had offered to help him over the weekend and he\u2019d already been revising Transfiguration all day. It had taken that long to turn an old top hat into a rabbit and back again.\nRemus finally found the shelf he was looking for \u2013\nThe British Wizards Guide to Nuptial Laws 1700 \u2013 1950\n. He hoped that would be recent enough. It was huge, and he had to get up on a step ladder to reach it. Stretching, Remus just about had purchase on the dusty old leather cover, and was about to pull it down towards him, when another hand reached up and grabbed his wrist.\nYelping, Remus yanked his hand back and almost toppled off the stool, coming face to face with Narcissa Black.\n\u201cUgh, it\u2019s\nyou\n.\u201d She said, distastefully. She was a head taller than him, so they came about level as long as he kept his balance. She did not release his hand, \u201cGive me that.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I had it first.\u201d He replied, still trying to pull away. She had an iron grip.\n\u201cGo away, little boy. What could you possibly want this for?\u201d She gave him a hard shove and he toppled backwards, landing painfully on his backside.\nNarcissa smiled down at him, victorious, holding the heavy tome. He scowled,\n\u201cWhat do\nyou\nwant it for?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d she breezed, tossing her pale hair out of her eyes in a manner eerily similar to Sirius. She turned and began to walk away, between the gloomy stacks. Remus scrambled to his feet,\n\u201cWait,\u201d He said, trying to keep his voice down so that Madam Pince didn\u2019t throw him out again, \u201cOi, Narcissa, wait!\u201d He tugged her robes.\nShe spun around with furious eyes, her wand raised. Remus instinctively grabbed his own wand just in time. They both stood like statues for a few moments. He knew that she had cursed James and Sirius on several occasions, and that the whole Black family knew all sorts of dark magic. But at the same time, Remus had never cursed a girl before, and it felt wrong.\n\u201cI just wanted to know,\u201d he said, carefully, choosing his words, \u201cIf it was anything to do with you and Sirius\u2026 the engagement thing.\u201d\nShe lowered her wand, slowly, regarding him with suspicious interest.\n\u201cSo he\u2019s told you all about that, has he?\u201d She raised an eyebrow \u2013 which was still as inky black as her natural hair colour. \u201cYes, little boy, that\u2019s exactly what I need it for. You don\u2019t think I\nwant\nto be married to that whiny little blood-traitor, do you?\u201d\nRemus just shrugged. The truth was, it hadn\u2019t actually occurred to him how Narcissa felt about any of it. He\u2019d been so focussed on helping Sirius that he hadn\u2019t considered whether anyone else might be working on exactly the same problem. Narcissa sighed impatiently,\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t. And I\u2019m not expecting my brat of a cousin to come up with a solution any time soon, so here I am.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t sound angry anymore, just bitter. Now that he was closer to her, Remus could see that she had dark rings under her eyes.\n\u201c\nI\nwant to find a solution.\u201d He said, tilting his chin up to meet her gaze, wishing he wasn\u2019t shorter than her. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cHa.\u201d Narcissa laughed humourlessly, \u201cA second year?! And what have you come up with, hm?\" She tapped her black patent heel on the dark floorboards.\n\"Well...\" Remus swallowed, \"Not much \u2013 nothing good enough yet. Unless... well, unless\nyo\nu\nwere already married.\"\n\"I've thought of that.\" Narcissa snapped, \"I'm not of age yet, I can't. I'd have eloped with Lucius the moment they proposed this ridiculous engagement, but I'm not seventeen until October.\"\n\"Right,\" Remus nodded, surprised to hear this, \"And... it can't wait, because of the betrothal ceremony this summer, right?\"\n\"Correct.\" She was looking at him with slightly less venom, now, as if she found the conversation amusing rather than irritating.\n\"But, I was thinking \u2013 what actually\ni\ns\nthe ceremony?\" He asked, feeling braver, \"What do you and Sirius have to do?\"\n\"Oh, the usual Black family rubbish,\" she replied, \"A banquet, astrological charts, probably a commemorative portrait of the two of us. Mother still has Bella's hanging up in the dining room.\"\nThe thought of a portrait depicting thirteen year old Sirius with his sixteen year old cousin was repulsive to Remus. Narcissa didn't sound like she relished the idea either. \"This is all his fault, you know.\" She said, \"Acting as if he's some special case. If he had simply followed tradition like the rest of us, toed the line until he was old enough to get out...\" She trailed off, her eyes bright with angry tears, which she wiped away quickly, \"Anyway, it doesn't matter. I'm marrying Lucius and that's all there is to it. Thank goodness he's stood by me through all of this, anyone else would have walked away.\"\nRemus didn't like to comment. What did he know about relationships? He'd never even seen one close up. They were silent for a few minutes, while Narcissa composed herself. Once she had, she gave a sniff and looked at Remus again, \"I shan't curse you.\" She said, magnanimously, \"But I'm warning you \u2013 I've had just about enough of people meddling with my future. So just keep your nose out from now on.\"\nWith that, she turned and left, leaving Remus with plenty to think about.\n* * *\nMonday 30th April 1973\n\"Moony, what are all of these books for?\" James asked, as he tripped over a pile Remus had carefully stacked near the dorm entrance \u2013 they were useless and he'd been planning to take them back that afternoon.\n\"Just some research.\" He replied, not looking up from his current book, \"Where've you been?\"\n\"Plotting.\" Sirius followed James him, stepping over the scattered books which his friend was trying to clear up. Remus raised an eyebrow,\n\"Plotting? Map or mischief?\"\n\"Bit of both,\" Sirius grinned, throwing himself onto Remus's bed. He picked up a book,\n\"\nWizard Wedding Rituals\n?!\" He laughed, \"Who you marrying, Moony? Not Evans, James'll have to challenge you to a duel.\"\n\"I do NOT fancy Evans.\" James spat, from where he squatted on the floor. \"\nMagical Marriages\n.\" He read, picking up the final book and placing it on top of the pile, \"Seriously, Remus, what's all this about?\"\nRemus sighed, putting down the book and rubbing his eyes,\n\"I'm trying to help you,\" he kicked Sirius gently with his foot. \"Someone's got to get you out of this stupid engagement.\"\n\"Oi!\" Sirius scowled, \"I'm doing everything I can.\"\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"Haven't I had more detentions than anyone else this year? I must get a howler a week. And my lions, don't forget my lions at the quidditch match.\"\nRemus stared at him, dumbfounded.\n\"How is any of that supposed to help?\"\n\"I'm proving that I'm not the marrying type.\"\n\"No offence, mate,\" James put in, coming to sit on the bed with them, \"But I don't think your lot really care that you're not the marrying type.\"\n\"Exactly,\" Remus nodded, \"You're the heir. You have to marry another pureblood. And the Black family have a long history of inter marriage, even your parents are cousins.\"\n\"Er... how do you know?\" Sirius looked uncomfortable.\n\"I've been reading.\" Remus gestured at all of the books. \"There's loads of stuff in the library on your family. One of the oldest wizarding houses in Britain, traced all the way back to the middle ages, where the family seat was in Inverness in Scotland--\"\n\"I know all of this.\" Sirius waved a hand.\n\"Yeah, but did you know that you aren't the first Black who wanted to get out of a marriage?\"\n\"Well obviously Andromeda \u2013 though that was more that she\ndid\nwant to marry, only Ted was the wrong sort...\"\n\"Not just her \u2013 Lyra Black defied the family's wishes in 1901 to marry into the Crabbe family, and Delphinus Black was supposed to marry his niece in 1750 but left her at the altar and married Fidelia Bulstrode. And, your Uncle Alphard never married either, though there's no explanation--\"\n\"Yeah, we're not supposed to talk about him,\" Sirius replied, edgily, \"I've heard mother ranting about him and I'm pretty sure he was a queer.\"\nThere was an awkward silence.\n\"My dad knew Alphard,\" James said, \"Said he was an all right bloke.\"\n\"He was always nice to me,\" Sirius shrugged, \"Left me his money and everything, made sure no one else can touch it until I'm of age. Makes my parents furious, you know, that he didn't return all his cash to the family vault, so I have to give him credit for that, even if he was... well, whatever.\"\nRemus's throat was very dry, and he cleared it, wanting to move on,\n\"So anyway, it just goes to show that you can get out of this sort of thing. Only problem is, I can't find any good details on\nhow\nthey all got away.\"\n\"Don't bother,\" Sirius said, gloomily, \"Even if you did find out \u2013 none of them had my mother to contend with. You know what she's like. She's probably going to make us take the unbreakable vow.\"\n\"She wouldn't!\" James said, aghast.\n\"She'd do anything.\" Sirius nodded.\nRemus chewed his lip, thoughtfully. He didn't know what the unbreakable vow was \u2013 it sounded like dark magic. From what he'd already read about the House of Black, he knew that the library's restricted section would probably have to be his next stop. He'd have to borrow James's cloak for that, and go at night. No matter. He refused to be deterred from this. He owed it to Sirius.\nHadn't Remus once told Sirius that his own problem was hopeless, inescapable? And hadn't Sirius worked tirelessly, learnt to perform complicated, NEWT standard magic, just to help him? This was no different. He just had to work harder. Knowing that Narcissa was also working on the problem was strangely comforting. Remus knew from her curses that she must be a very accomplished and clever witch, and there was no doubt in his mind that she usually got her way.\nI'm marrying Lucius and that's all there is to it.\nThere had to be something in that. He remembered Flitwick telling them that love - natural, everyday, human love -\u00a0was one of the most powerful types of magic. While Remus didn't personally feel that anything about Lucius and Narcissa's coupling was natural, exactly, he knew that it was a lot more powerful than family honour. It had to be."

            "title": "Second Year: Exams",
            "summary_and_notes": "",
            "content": "May 1973\nExam season began at the worst possible time for Remus, around mid May, right when the full moon was due. The moon itself fell on a Friday, which meant he was able to attend his Potions test that morning \u2013 but he lost the whole weekend to sleep, when he would really have preferred to revise. More than that, the moon had thrown his magic off completely.\nHe'd thought it was happening less in his second year, but as their exams got closer \u2013 whether it was nerves or the lengthening days \u2013 Remus found his magic growing stronger, wilder and harder to control. The slightest wand movement caused the most fantastic results, and sometimes he'd barely finished speaking the incantation before light was bursting from its tip, making his fingers tingle with shock.\nJames had taken to saying '\nc\nalm down, Moony!\n' at least three or four times a day, as Remus attempted to practice various basic transfigurative spells and charms which inevitably went too far. He'd thought that just doing simple incantations might help him gain some control, but this was apparently not the case, as he smashed the dorm room window a third time attempting to levitate his gobstone set.\n\"\nReparo\n.\" Sirius muttered, glancing over the top of his Astronomy revision. The window fixed itself at once. Remus sighed.\n\"You really\u00a0need to relax, mate,\" James grinned, \"We don't have any practical exams until next week anyway.\"\n\"I'm so behind, though!\" Remus grumbled, collecting up his gobstones and putting them back in their box.\n\"If you're behind then what am I?!\" Peter wailed from the floor, where he had five texts spread out in front of him, all different subjects. \"I know I'm going to fail Transfiguration, my rabbit hasn't changed at all this year, and I\nknow\nshe's going to make us do something really hard.\"\n\"At least you're good at Potions.\" Remus shot back. \"And Herbology, I can't ever remember which leaves mean what...\"\n\"You beat me on our last Herbology quiz,\" James reminded him, \"And you've got us all by the bollocks when it comes to History of Magic, I've been copying your homework all year.\"\n\"But\nyou\n'\nre\nbest at Transfigur-\" Remus started, but was interrupted by a loud thump as Sirius threw his Astronomy book to the floor.\n\"Will you all shut up?! I'm trying to revise!\" He yelled, standing up. \"Like a bunch of old women nattering. I'm going to the library.\" He pulled his satchel over his shoulder and stormed out of the room.\nThey sat in silence for a little while. Peter, gnawing his lip, looked on the verge of tears. James sighed,\n\"Ignore him, he's just in a mood because he has to go home soon. Not that I blame him.\" He added, quickly. \"Parents like that, and all.\"\n\"S'pose,\" Remus shrugged, though he didn't think it was a good enough excuse, really. It wasn't as if he, Remus, was much looking forward to the summer holidays either. All right, fine, he didn't have to marry his cousin, or attend weird stuffy banquets \u2013 but nor did Sirius have to be locked up in a cell once a month, or hide from much older, rougher boys whose greatest delight was shoving your head in the bogs.\n\"He's not staying with you again, then, James?\" Peter asked, nervously \u2013 probably quite looking forward to a Sirius-free summer, as it meant he would have James all to himself.\n\"Nah,\" James replied, sounding much less cheerful\u00a0at the prospect, \"He's got an open invite, obviously \u2013 you all have,\" he eyed Remus, \"But we don't reckon it'll happen after the fiasco at Christmas. He thinks he'll be locked up completely until the betrothal ceremony.\"\nRemus felt a pang of guilt in his chest. He still hadn't come up with a workable solution to that, and between revision and the full moon he hadn't even thought about it properly in two weeks. Judging by Narcissa's behaviour in the halls \u2013 hexing anyone who so much as looked at her sideways \u2013 she had not fared much better.\n\"Well if he keeps acting the way he does he'll lose more than his hair next time,\" Peter said, primly, sorting through his notes.\n\"What'd you mean?\" James frowned, sitting up, \"Saying it's all his fault?!\"\n\"No!\" Peter looked alarmed at James's tone, \"\nNo\n, I just mean... well, you know the other day he packed all those Gryffindor house banners in his trunk. He wants to put them up in his bedroom to annoy his parents. Stuff like that is exactly what gets him into trouble.\"\n\"Nothing wrong with a bit of house pride.\" James sniffed defensively, though he shot a nervous glance at Sirius's trunk.\nRemus didn't get involved. Personally, he agreed with Peter and Narcissa \u2013 Sirius was his own worst enemy, a lot of the time. For someone so intelligent and magically gifted, he completely lacked subtlety, or even forethought. If he didn't have to mouth off at every opportunity, then maybe he wouldn't have found himself engaged at the age of thirteen. Remus knew better than anyone the importance of keeping a low profile, especially when you were different from everyone around you.\nJames, who was more like Sirius than Peter or Remus, wholeheartedly disagreed. In his mind, the most important thing was to always fight back. But if everything was a battle, then inevitably\nsomeone\nhad to lose. And until he was of age, that was going to be Sirius every time.\n* * *\n\"Excellent, Mr Potter!\" McGonagall gushed uncharacteristically, as James transformed his rabbits into a perfect pair of fine red\u00a0velvet slippers with a fur trim.\nRemus took a deep breath, steadying himself for his own attempt. It was a week and a half since the full moon and he was finally back in control, though his nerves still got the better of him\u00a0sometimes. He watched Sirius lazily wave his wand over his own rabbits, and they too transfigured into a lovely pair of black wool booties.\nPeter's slippers still had ears and a tail even after three attempts, and left droppings on the desk. When Remus took his turn, he closed his eyes first, feeling light headed, before finally uttering the incantation.\nThe slippers were not as neat as James and Sirius's, but they were wearable, and at least no longer had any leporine features, even if they stayed a dull brown colour. At least\u00a0he knew he had done his very best on the theory paper \u2013 in fact on all of his theory papers. He was satisfied that he'd remembered everything he needed to remember when it came to his best subjects, and that he hadn't done too hideously in Potions, Herbology or Astronomy.\nAt the end of the Transfiguration exam, McGonagall returned all of the rabbits to their original state and sent them\u00a0hopping back into their hutch at the back of the room ready for the next exam. She then began to hand out sheets of parchment that looked like blank timetables.\n\"You will be aware,\" she said, very formally, \"that in your third year you may choose a minimum of two additional subjects to take up to ordinary wizarding level. Here are your application sheets. If you will please think very carefully, reviewing each subject's merits, then complete the form and return it to my office no later than the last day of term.\"\nThe class began to murmur excitedly, and Remus looked down at his form, and the subjects listed there, with great trepidation.\nAs they all filed out of the room, Peter immediately began to badger James to find out which subjects he would be taking \u2013\u00a0so that he could select the exact same ones.\n\"Muggle Studies.\" Sirius said, as they headed outside into the summer sunshine, \"Definitely going to take Muggle Studies.\"\nRemus rolled his eyes. There was no surprise there \u2013 if any subject was going to win the general disapproval of the Black family, then there it was.\n\"D'you think Evans will take that?\" James scratched his chin. Sirius grinned,\n\"Doubt it, mate, she's muggle born. You could impress her with your knowledge, though.\"\n\"Yeah... yeah, maybe...\" James looked down, thoughtfully.\n\"Are you going to take that, then, James?\" Peter asked, anxiously, \"Do you think it'll be difficult? I\u00a0s'pose we could just ask Remus for help... are you taking it, Moony?\"\n\"Nah,\" Remus shook his head, \"What's the point? You lot do it, though, then maybe you can stop asking me stuff.\"\nHe secretly wished that there was a 'Wizarding Studies' subject he could take, so he didn't have to feel quite so out of his depth all of the time.\u00a0But, he supposed, that was the arrogance of wizards.\n\"Divination... that's like fortune telling, right?\" James sat down on the grass, throwing off his robes. Sirius followed suit, rolling up his shirt sleeves.\n\"I think so. Crystal balls and tea leaves.\"\n\"Sounds like a right doss. Let's do that.\"\nAll three of them scribbled onto their papers. Remus did not. He didn't like the idea of knowing the future \u2013 whatever he had coming to him, he was sure it couldn't be good. He tapped his temple with his wand quickly and whispered,\n\"\nLectiuncula\n\nMagna\n,\" beginning to read through his options. \"Arithmancy,\" he murmured, \"Is that like arithmetic?\"\n\"Numbers, anyway,\" Sirius replied, \"It's supposed to be really difficult.\"\n\"Care of Magical Creatures... dunno about that,\" James snorted, \"Have you seen the teacher? He's got more scars than Moony.\"\n\"Oi,\" Remus kicked his ankle. Care of Magical Creatures had actually sounded quite interesting to him. After all, he sort of\nwas\na magical creature himself.\n\"I think I'll do Arithmancy, if you are,\" Sirius said, still reading his paper.\n\"Will it really be difficult?\" Peter worried.\n\"We'll help you, Pete, don't worry.\" James soothed. \"Anyway, there are better things about third year than extra homework \u2013 Hogsmeade!\"\n\"You go to Honeyduke's three times a week.\" Remus replied,\u00a0mulling over the possibility of Ancient Runes.\n\"Yeah, but Zonko's!\"\nRemus grinned at him. He was actually pretty excited about the Hogsmeade trips \u2013 he'd never been to any of the protected wizarding areas other than Hogwarts, and he\u00a0was sick of hearing about how great Diagon Alley was. He sighed and lay back, looking up at the clouds. He would think about his third year subjects later, there was no hurry. For now, he wanted to enjoy the end of exams, and revel in the thought that they still had almost a full month before school ended.\n\"Oi oi, Evans!\" James sat up, suddenly.\nRemus sighed, inwardly. James had been acting more and more of an idiot where Lily was concerned, ever since the midnight feast.\n\"I'm not a dog, Potter,\" her voice echoed across the grounds, \"Don't yell at me like one.\"\n\"Hi Sirius,\" Mary's voice now. Remus sat up, blinking.\nMarlene gave a shy wave, which he returned.\n\"All right, MacDonald,\" Sirius nodded, casually sweeping his hair behind one ear. He'd started doing that whenever there were girls around. Remus hated it.\nAll three girls had ice creams, which looked like an excellent idea considering the unseasonably warm weather. Lily had even charmed a Chinese fan to follow her around, creating a cool breeze wherever the three girls went.\n\"Give us a lick, then,\" James winked at her, lewdly. Marlene turned beetroot red and dissolved into giggles, but Lily remained calm, arching one red eyebrow.\n\"You do look like you need cooling off.\nAgua\nmente\n!\"\nWith that, she aimed her wand at the marauders and sprayed them all with icy cold water. Remus leapt out of the way, but she wasn't trying to get him anyway. James and Sirius got the worst of it, and shouted in dismay as their hair and shirts were drenched. Mary, Marlene and Lily cackled with glee.\n\"What'd you do that for?\" Sirius growled, pulling his dripping\u00a0hair apart to glare at them, looking like a drowned rat.\n\"Thought you lot liked practical jokes?\" Lily winked at him, before turning away and walking towards the lake.\n\"Complete nightmare, that one.\" Sirius groaned, trying a hot air charm on his hair.\n\"That's my future wife you're taking about,\" James replied, dreamily, watching her go. His glasses had steamed up comically. \"Oh stop being so dramatic, you'll dry out in half an hour in this heat.\"\n\"Where'd you think they got the ice cream?\" Peter asked, distantly.\nRemus smiled, lying back again. Never mind going home, or betrothals or new subjects.\u00a0For now, everything was just as it should be."

            "summary_and_notes": "",
            "content": "Friday 29\nth\nJune 1973\nRemus was running late, and there was still so much left to do. As usual, he had slept later than the rest of the marauders, and by the time he woke up, Peter was the only one left, scurrying out of the door with a quick, \u201cMorning Lupin! Good luck!\u201d\nChecking the clock, Remus had leapt out of bed and run for the shower in a state of panic. As he combed his hair in the mirror \u2013 thinking glumly that this might be the last time, as Matron was sure to shave him bald as soon as he was back at St Edmund\u2019s tomorrow \u2013 he ran through the list in his head.\nBreakfast first, of course \u2013 couldn\u2019t miss that. If he got a move on, then he might just catch James and Peter before they set off on their own missions. It would likely be his only chance to see them, because today, the very last day of term, the usually united marauders would be conspicuously separate until the feast.\nAfter breakfast he would have to run back upstairs to pack \u2013 Remus was quite sure that they would have a detention coming their way that evening, and he might not have enough time the next morning before they had to catch the train. Once he\u2019d packed, he needed to return his library books. This filled him with a sense of guilt \u2013 he still hadn\u2019t found anything to help Sirius, despite weeks of research. Their only hope now was that the Black cousins would be able to find a way out of the engagement\nafter\nthe betrothal ceremony had taken place.\nOn his way to the library he\u2019d be able to drop off his subject applications form at McGonagall\u2019s office \u2013 he\u2019d put that off far too long already. Then, books returned and form handed in, Remus thought he should have ample time to meet Peter outside the greenhouses at eleven o\u2019clock, where he would collect the invisibility cloak.\nAs long as everything went like clockwork, Remus should then be able to get the umbrellas he needed from the gamekeeper\u2019s shed on the grounds, and smuggle them back to their dorm room. Then it would be about lunch time \u2013 Remus was hoping to use that hour to finish reading his book in peace \u2013 he\u2019d borrowed it from Sirius and only had a chapter left, so he really wanted that out of the way before they had to go home. Especially as he sincerely doubted that McGonagall would allow him to read during his inevitable detention that evening.\nShortly after lunch, that, the first stage of the marauders end of term plan would come into effect. He would avoid the mayhem and double check he\u2019d packed everything \u2013 possibly doing a bit of Sirius\u2019s packing too, because the other boy still hadn\u2019t done it and Remus suspected he was leaving it to the last minute. Then the preparations for the feast would begin \u2013 all he had to do was show up early enough to help James and Sirius with the final incantations. This was provided, of course, that none of them got caught before then.\nThere was a sudden knock at the bathroom door, just as Remus was pulling up his jeans,\n\u201cToast out here for you, Moony,\u201d Sirius\u2019s voice called, \u201cThought I\u2019d save you some time.\u201d\n\u201cOh, great, cheers!\u201d Remus called back, pulling on his shirt quickly, as if Sirius might see him through the wood.\n\u201cGood luck! See you this afternoon!\u201d\n\u201cYeah \u2013 you too!\u201d\nRemus heard Sirius\u2019s footsteps retreat and disappear down the staircase. Well. At least that was one thing taken care of. He emerged from the steamy bathroom and saw the plate of toast sitting on his trunk. Four slices \u2013 Sirius had not been stingy \u2013 and each liberally coated with a different spread. Remus grinned and renewed his pledge to help Sirius pack later on.\nHe spent a leisurely hour munching on the toast and collecting up various belongings which had spread themselves far and wide from his bed to his friends\u2019 shelves, even down into the common room. He took the opportunity to play\nHunky Dory\none last time, saying a fond goodbye to the record player for a few months.\nThe David Bowie print Sirius had given him for his birthday no longer moved \u2013 which Remus was somewhat glad for, because at least that meant he could take it back to St Edmund\u2019s without arousing any suspicion. His trunk didn\u2019t seem to close as easily as it had at the end of last summer, when he\u2019d been on his way to Hogwarts, and he had to rearrange the items several times before everything squashed inside.\nRemus brushed his teeth and went to gather his library books, stuffing them into his threadbare satchel. He wondered if Matron might let him have a new school bag \u2013 mind you, last time he\u2019d asked for one she\u2019d taken the opportunity to teach him how to sew. \u2018A life skill\u2019, she\u2019d said. He didn\u2019t bother telling her that the repairing charm work much better \u2013 but even that wasn\u2019t much use any more.\nWith his list of chosen subjects in hand, he headed down into the common room, where every other Gryffindor seemed to be doing their last-minute packing too. The usually cosy space was in uproar, with shouts pleading for the return of missing books and games, students crawling under tables and lifting sofas hunting for long lost items, groups of tearful seventh year girls hugging everyone goodbye, and owls swooping this way and that.\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Mary stopped him on his way out, \u201cYou all by yourself?\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d He nodded, with a mischievous grin. She grinned back,\n\u201cOooh, what are you lot planning? Me and Marlene were just saying how you\u2019d been quiet for the last few weeks\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAsk me no questions and I\u2019ll tell you no lies.\u201d He replied. \u201cSorry, but I\u2019ve got to return my books\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLily\u2019s looking for you,\u201d she said quickly.\n\u201cOh, um\u2026 I\u2019ll be in the dining hall for lunch. Bit busy until then, tell her sorry!\u201d\nWith that he hurried through the portrait hall and out into the corridor, which was just as busy with students rushing back and forth, saying their last-minute goodbyes. Peeves, caught up in the excitement had obviously found out wherever Filch stored the toilet roll and was flinging wads of wet tissue at anyone who got close enough.\nArms over his head, Remus scurried towards McGonagall\u2019s office just as Peeves fired at the door. Remus ducked, just in time, and Peeves flew of laughing maniacally as McGonagall \u2013 having heard the very loud \u2018SPLAT\u2019 \u2013 opened her office door. She peered down at Remus, still squatting and covering his head.\n\u201cMr Lupin.\u201d\n\u201cIt was Peeves!\u201d He stood up, quickly, \u201cHonestly Professor!\u201d\n\u201cI believe you.\u201d She gave a small smile, \u201cSpirits are always high on the last day of term. Have you got something for me?\u201d The old teacher glanced at the parchment he was clutching.\n\u201cOh, yes!\u201d He stuck out his hand.\n\u201cExcellent, do come in, Lupin.\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026\u201d\nBut you could hardly say \u2018no\u2019 to McGonagall, or ask her if it could wait until later. He wondered what on earth she wanted \u2013 surely Sirius and James hadn\u2019t been caught already? It would be pretty obvious as soon as phase one of the plan was initiated, and he\u2019d heard nothing\u2026\n\u201cSit down, Mr Lupin. Tea?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 yeah, ok.\u201d He sat, uneasily. McGonagall waved her wand, and the little tartan teapot on her desk began to pour its contents into two matching cups.\n\u201cHelp yourself to milk,\u201d the professor said, absentmindedly, as she scanned the piece of parchment he\u2019d given her. \u201cDivination,\u201d she said, \u201cMuggle Studies and Arithmancy.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t say anything. She looked up, finally, surveying him over the tops of her square spectacles. \u201cThese are the same subjects Mr Potter and Mr Black have chosen, if I\u2019m not much mistaken? Mr Pettigrew too, hm?\u201d\nRemus just nodded. Actually, Peter was only taking Divination and Muggle Studies \u2013 he had found out that you only needed to select a minimum of two new subjects and had decided not to push himself any further than necessary. Remus would rather die than take on less work than James or Sirius.\n\u201cI\u2019m interested to know what prompted you to select Muggle Studies, in particular? Considering a future in the Muggle Liaisons office, perhaps?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Remus stammered. He had no idea what the Muggle Liaisons office was, but it didn\u2019t sound very interesting.\n\u201cI would have thought you\u2019d have sufficient knowledge of the Muggle World, having spent so much of your life in it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026 well\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to take subjects simply because your friends are, Mr Lupin.\u201d Professor McGonagall said, more kindly than he\u2019d expected. \u201cYou\u2019ll still be taking the same core classes, after all.\u201d\nRemus shrugged. He hadn\u2019t known what else to do. Really, all the subjects had interested him \u2013 ok, perhaps not Muggle Studies, she was right there \u2013 but in the end, he hadn\u2019t much liked the idea of missing out on lessons with the other marauders.\n\u201cOne of the most wonderful things about school, Mr Lupin,\u201d McGonagall began, tactfully, \u201cIs the friends we make \u2013 connections and relationships that last a lifetime. I know you have made some very dear friends at Hogwarts.\u201d\nRemus fought a grimace. Did she have to make it sound so girly?! She cleared her throat, clearly amused by his reaction, \u201cSome very dear friends. But school is also the place to challenge ourselves, to test our mettle. Do you understand?\u201d\nHe nodded, blankly. She sighed, sipping her tea.\n\u201cYour exam results were excellent this year, Remus.\u201d\nHe straightened up a little, at that. He was pretty chuffed with the results himself. He hadn\u2019t beat James at Transfiguration, or Snape and Lily at Potions, but in everything else he had some of the highest marks in his class.\n\u201cAs such,\u201d McGonagall continued, \u201cI have no concerns in permitting you to study Arithmancy \u2013 which, I must tell you, is one of the most challenging courses we offer at Hogwarts. But I would question whether Muggle Studies is a suitable use of your time going forward. You might find it very dull, I\u2019m afraid. Have you considered, for example, Ancient Runes?\u201d\nRemus twisted his hands in his lap. It\nhad\nsounded quite interesting. But he\u2019d spent so much time struggling to read English, and catching up with the rest of the students, that he\u2019d balked at the idea of learning another language. McGonagall seemed to understand his concerns \u2013 at least in part.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t find it as difficult as you think, you know. You\u2019re an immensely gifted scholar, and a very hard worker. In addition, your fellow Gryffindors Miss MacDonald and Miss McKinnon will be in the same class.\u201d\nThis didn\u2019t sound too bad, actually. He was very fond of the two M\u2019s now, and it would be fun to spend a bit more time with them. How nice it would be to have a lesson in which there was no Sirius showing off, no Peter trying to copy his notes \u2013 and no James acting like a prat to get Lily\u2019s attention.\n\u201cOk.\u201d He said. \u201cI\u2019ll give it a go.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent.\u201d McGonagall smiled widely, looking genuinely pleased. She waved her wand over his form to amend it.\n\u201cUm\u2026 Professor?\u201d He asked, suddenly, slightly nervous again.\n\u201cYes, Lupin?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 well I was thinking about another subject, too. Maybe\u2026 maybe instead of Divination?\u201d\nMcGonagall\u2019s smile turned wry.\n\u201cWell I can\u2019t pretend I\u2019ve ever seen much use in Divination myself\u2026 not unless the witch or wizard concerned is genuinely gifted with the sight.\u201d\nRemus nodded, assuming that this meant he was not thus gifted.\n\u201cI thought, maybe\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s probably silly\u2026\u201d\nJames had said it was silly. A girly subject.\n\u201cUm\u2026 Care of Magical Creatures.\u201d He said, all in a rush.\nMcGonagall looked genuinely surprised.\n\u201cThis is something which interests you?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 yeah, I s\u2019pose so. Not just because I\u2019m\u2026 y\u2019know. But. Yeah, I s\u2019pose mostly because of that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a very interesting subject,\u201d McGonagall sipped her tea again. \u201cI should say that if you\u2019re more interested in that than Divination, then by all means.\u201d\n\u201cGreat, ok, change it.\u201d He nodded, feeling a bit embarrassed but also quite pleased with himself. McGonagall waved her wand once more.\n\u201cYour father was rather gifted when it came to magical creatures, you know.\u201d She said. Remus raised his eyebrows.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d She nodded, as if she was just passing the time of day. \u201cAn expert in his field.\u201d\n\u201cHis\u2026 field?\u201d\n\u201cNon-human spirituous apparitions. Boggarts and ghosts, you know \u2013 dementors, too. All rather dark, I\u2019m afraid. Care of Magical Creatures mainly focuses on corporeal \u2013 that is to say,\nmortal\ncreatures, but you may well share his talents.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right. Thanks, Professor.\u201d Remus got up, quickly. He didn\u2019t have\ntime\nto think about his father now. He had so much to do. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get to the library.\u201d He indicated his heavy bag, splitting at the seams.\n\u201cYes, yes, quite,\u201d McGonagall nodded. \u201cThank you, Remus. I\u2019ll see you at the feast tonight.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, bye!\u201d\nAs he finally exited McGonagall\u2019s office, Remus glanced at the clock. It was ten to eleven. Damn. No time for the library now, he had to meet Peter on the grounds, and it usually took at least fifteen minutes to get out of the castle, providing none of the staircases forced you off track. Heaving his unreasonably weighty bookbag, Remus sighed and set off on his way.\nBy the time he reached the greenhouses, sweating and too hot in the bright sunshine, Peter had obviously been waiting for a little while, and was wringing his hands.\n\u201cThere you are!\u201d He gasped, \u201cI thought something had happened.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Remus panted, wiping his forehead with his sleeve, \u201cMcGonagall wanted a chat. Everything go ok?\u201d\n\u201cYep,\u201d Peter nodded, eyes darting around, \u201cJust like James told me. Have you seen them?\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\u201cEverything should be ok, then. Here.\u201d Peter handed Remus the invisibility cloak.\n\u201cCheers. Oi, are you going back to the dorm?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I still need to pack\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGreat, mind taking my books back? I wanted to return them to the library, but McGonagall\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOk,\u201d Peter took the bag. \u201cBloody hell, Moony!\u201d He groaned, sagging under the weight of it.\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you at lunch?\u201d\n\u201cProbably. Good luck!\u201d Peter went scurrying off back towards the castle, leaving Remus alone again.\nGlancing around to make sure the coast was clear, Remus wasted no time in approaching the equipment shed. He\u2019d been in it once before for a detention in his first year \u2013 it was much bigger on the inside than it looked, and full of various tools for maintaining the expansive Hogwarts grounds. The lock did not respond to the usual\nAlohomora\nincantation, but it absolutely\ndid\nrespond to a few quick twists with one of Lily Evans\u2019 hairpins. She\u2019d given him the pin the evening before, with a quizzical look, but hadn\u2019t asked why he needed it.\nOnce inside, Remus acted quickly, finding the large black trunk of umbrellas. He wasn\u2019t quite sure why wizards still used umbrellas \u2013 surely there were spells for protecting yourself from rain? But, nevertheless, they didn\u2019t want anyone summoning them and ruining their fun. Remus covered the trunk with the invisibility cloak and cast a weightlessness charm on it, before levitating the whole thing out of the shed.\nHe strolled back up to the school in a leisurely manner, trying not to look as though he was up to anything at all, hiding his wand under his robes so no one could see that it was guiding the invisible trunk. It took a good half an hour to navigate himself and the trunk through the castle unnoticed, and without bumping into any other students. Several times he had to levitate the thing over his own head, which took a lot of effort and concentration.\nStill, he did it, reaching his destination with an enormous sense of achievement. He left the trunk in the dorm room, and performed a sticking charm on the lock. If anyone\ndid\ntry to summon it, they hopefully wouldn\u2019t be able to get it open in time to save themselves. He folded the cloak neatly and left it on James\u2019s pillow.\nPeter had dropped Remus\u2019s book bag at the foot of his bed, and Remus sighed to himself, realising that he would have to return the books before he could go for lunch. Hoisting it onto his back, he once more descended the staircase into the Gryffindor common room.\nOnce again, he was waylaid, this time by Lily, who looked extremely flustered and extremely pleased to see him.\n\u201cThere you are!\u201d She shrieked, grabbing his shoulders, \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you everywhere!\u201d\n\u201cHiya Lily,\u201d he smiled, politely, \u201cSorry, can it wait? I\u2019ve got to get to the\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d She shook her head vehemently, \u201cCan we go up to your room? The others aren\u2019t there, are they?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he sighed. He could go to the library later, if he skipped trying to finish his book, or if his visit to Madam Pomfrey didn\u2019t take too long. He followed Lily back up the stairs.\n\u201cDo I want to know what that is?\u201d She said, glancing at the big black trunk.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a trunk full of umbrellas.\u201d He said, promptly. She raised an eyebrow, but didn\u2019t question him further.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got something for you.\u201d She put down her bag on top of the trunk, rifling through it. She withdrew a very strange item. It looked like a sheet of clear plastic. Remus furrowed his brow, as she handed it to him. He turned it over.\n\u201cErm\u2026 Lily\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry it took me so long \u2013 I had to wait ages for the acetate. My mum got it from a friend of hers who\u2019s a teacher. They use them for overhead projectors in muggle schools. Well, you know that, obviously.\u201d\nRemus nodded, blankly. There had been an OHP at St Edmund\u2019s, but it had needed its lightbulb replacing about three years ago and as far as he knew no one had yet got around to it.\n\u201cGot a book?\u201d Lily nodded at his bag. \u201cGet one out, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\nHe complied, curious to see where this was going. She opened the text at a random page, placed it on the trunk, then lay the acetate over it. \u201cLook.\u201d She said.\nRemus looked, about to withdraw his wand in case she wanted him to read something. She shook her head, pushing his hand away. \u201cJust look.\u201d She said.\nHe looked again, rubbing his neck.\n\n\u2018There are three key elements to performing a successful unbreakable vow. In the first instance\u2026\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Remus exclaimed, picking up the book and staring.\n\u201cDid it work?!\u201d Lily looked at him, eagerly, \u201cCan you read it?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 yeah\u2026 I\u2026 bloody hell, Evans!\u201d He flipped the page again, replacing the acetate. It worked. It was much less fiddly than Sirius\u2019s spell.\n\u201cIt should work outside of Hogwarts, too.\u201d She said, her green eyes sparkling, \u201cI fiddled about with the incantation a bit, and there was some potion work involved, but it should last a good long time.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re amazing!\u201d Remus said, still reading. \u201cThank you so much!\u201d\nQuite out of the blue, Lily leapt at Remus, flinging her arms around his neck and hugging him. Taken a bit by surprise, Remus felt himself blushing. He\u2019d never been hugged very often before \u2013 let alone by a girl. She was soft, and her hair smelled nice, like apples.\n\u201cI wanted to do it in time for your birthday,\u201d she said, stepping back, still smiling, \u201cBut I kept messing it up. Thank goodness it worked! You\u2019d have thought I was mental if it hadn\u2019t!\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he laughed, nervously, still recovering from the surprise embrace. \u201cThank you Lily, this is\u2026 it\u2019s just such an amazing thing.\u201d\n\u201cYou deserve it, Remus,\u201d she said, earnestly, \u201cHonestly, you work so bloody hard, and you keep up with Potter and Black.\u201d\nRemus shrugged. There was a slightly awkward silence.\n\u201cLook, I\u2019ll let you get on.\u201d Lily said, finally, \u201cSorry I waylaid you like that. See you at the feast?\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026 yeah definitely.\u201d Remus looked back down at the book. \u201cOh shit, wait \u2013 Evans, have you got an umbrella?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 I think so? I might have packed it already.\u201d\n\u201cUnpack it,\u201d he said, firmly. \u201cAnd take it to the feast, ok?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Ok?\u201d\nOnce she had left, Remus allowed himself a moment to sit down. He couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d done it. He couldn\u2019t believe he hadn\u2019t thought of it! It was so simple, so elegant. He would be able to read all summer! He flipped to another page.\n\n\u2018It is important to note that the unbreakable vow, once made, cannot be superseded by any other kind of vow, oath or promise made thereafter, regardless of any legal or moral concerns around keeping such a vow. It is therefore pivotal that\u2014\u2018\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Remus gasped, suddenly. It was as if there was a \u2018click\u2019 in his brain, and everything had fallen into place. \u201cOH!\u201d He leapt up.\nThe library would have to be put off just a little while longer.\n* * *\nIt was at times like this, Remus thought, as he paced up and down the dark corridor, that he could really do with the completed marauders map. Unfortunately, they had so far only managed to map three quarters of the castle, and were a long way off tagging every student yet.\nRemus had been waiting outside the Slytherin common room for twenty minutes now, with no luck at all. The green robed students who passed him ignored his pleas for help, and even the Bloody Baron had carried on his way with a disdainful sniff. It was getting hopeless. He would miss lunch at this rate. He looked at the nearest clock. It was half past twelve. Phase one of the plan was imminent.\nWhen the common room wall opened once more, his heart sank even further.\n\u201cWell well well.\u201d Snape smirked, \u201cThey said there was a mad Gryffindor on the loose, but I didn\u2019t think it would be\nyou\n, Loony Lupin.\u201d\nRemus sighed.\n\u201cPiss off, Snivellus.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so rude,\u201d Snape raised his wand, \u201cI ought to wash your mouth out with soap.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you knew\nhow\nto wash.\u201d Remus replied, dryly.\n\u201cWhy, you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCan we not?\u201d Remus said, irritably, \u201cIt\u2019s the last day of term, and there\u2019s plenty of stuff I\u2019d rather be doing. Can you just\u2026 I dunno, let me in or something?\u201d\n\u201cLet you in?!\u201d Snape\u2019s black eyes shone with amusement, \u201cWhy on earth would I let you in?!\u201d\n\u201cI need to speak to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOut of the way, Snape, you slimy git.\u201d A voice came from the wall behind Severus. Barty Crouch Jr. stepped out, followed by Regulus. Remus felt a small measure of relief,\n\u201cRegulus! Can you get Narcissa for m\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\nMordeo\n!\u201d Without warning, Crouch aimed a curse at Remus, who dodged it just in time, pulling out his own wand.\n\u201c\nExpelli\n-\u201d He started, but it was too late, Crouch cursed him a second time, and pain rocketed through Remus\u2019s skull, his head ringing. It was awful, but he didn\u2019t flinch. It only hurt for a while, and he knew pain like an old friend. If they thought that something as commonplace as that would stop him, they had another thing coming.\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you want, half-blood?\u201d Crouch asked, grinning madly, \u201cOr are you just thick, hanging around here all alone?\u201d\n\u201cHe\nis\nthick,\u201d Severus said, \u201cAs two short planks.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Snape,\u201d Crouch said, turning his wand on Severus, now. Remus narrowed his eyes, paying attention. Apparently, Snape was bad at making friends wherever he went.\n\u201cShut up both of you,\u201d Regulus finally spoke, sounding bored. He had been watching Remus\u2019s face the whole time, \u201cWhat\u2019d you want, Lupin? Better tell me before Barty fancies practicing one of his unforgiveable\u2019s on you.\u201d\n\u201cI need to speak to Narcissa.\u201d Remus said, very clearly and as calmly as he could. \u201cIt\u2019s urgent. It\u2019s about\u2026 you know, Black family stuff.\u201d\nRegulus watched him for a few moments longer, not speaking. He was so like Sirius \u2013 only without any of the joy or humour. If Remus hadn\u2019t known better, he\u2019d have said Regulus was the elder brother.\n\u201cSnape, go and get my cousin, will you?\u201d He said, sharply, not even moving his head.\nSnape looked furious, but he obeyed. Did everyone do whatever the Blacks told them to? James often teased Sirius for acting as though he was royalty, but perhaps he was just playing the role he\u2019d been raised for.\nCrouch soon grew bored, and wandered off, leaving Regulus and Remus still facing each other in stony silence. Remus was actually glad to see Narcissa\u2019s sour face, when she finally came through the wall.\n\u201cOh Merlin,\u201d she sighed, staring down at Remus, \u201cWhat\nnow\n?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve figured it out!\u201d He said, quickly, \u201cThe\u2026 the problem. I\u2019ve got a solution.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes?\u201d She folded her arms, looking unconvinced.\n\u201cThe unbreakable vow,\u201d he hurried, keen to get it all out so that he could go. \u201cIt can\u2019t be broken, ever.\u201d\nShe snorted,\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s certainly implied.\u201d\nRemus rolled his eyes impatiently.\n\u201cI\nmean\n,\u201d he said, more slowly, his bravery mounting, \u201cThat if you\u2019ve made an unbreakable vow, then you can\u2019t make any other promises that go against it. You can\u2019t even be forced to make other promises. Or\nvows\n.\u201d He stressed the last word, meaningfully.\nThe light switched on in Narcissa\u2019s eyes almost immediately. For a second, her pretty pink lips formed the same \u2018oh\u2019 that Remus had made only an hour or so before when it had come to him. She did not have time to speak, however, because in the same moment there was a shriek from somewhere up the hall, causing them all to turn. A Slytherin girl came bursting out of a girl\u2019s bathroom at the end of the corridor, wailing,\n\u201cThey all just\u2026 exploded!\u201d She said, looking fainting disturbed. Sure enough, they could see through the swinging toilet door behind her that waves of pink foam were spilling from the wash basins and toilets. It was truly magnificent \u2013 gorgeous great drifts of soft soapy bubbles tumbled out of every tap and drain.\n\u201cI um\u2026 I have to go!\u201d Remus grinned, winking at Narcissa, then breaking into a run."

            "content": "The rest of the afternoon was nothing short of chaotic \u2013 and Remus knew that Sirius and James, wherever they were, must be having the time of their lives. Every single bathroom in the castle had been mysteriously affected by the foam flood, and no one seemed to be able to stop it for very long. Huge drifts of bubbles clogged the hallways like pink snow, and those students who didn\u2019t want to play in it did not appear to mind being forced out onto the grounds to loll about on the grass and spend their last day in the sunshine.\nRemus, who had already had to sacrifice his lunch hour, still needed to get to the library and return his books, help Sirius pack (though, actually, he told himself, as he pelted up the stairs to Gryffindor tower, he had done quite enough to help Sirius for one day) and see Madam Pomfrey for an end of year check-up. He also needed to get to the Great Hall early to help James and Sirius with the final phase of their plan. It was not complex magic, but it was strong, and ideally needed as many wands as possible.\nLibrary first, he thought to himself, purposefully as he entered the now desolate common room. At least there was no one to hold him up now. One of the others had obviously been in the dorm room since Remus had last left it, because it was even messier than before and the invisibility cloak was now missing.\nJames, who was probably the tidiest of all four of them, had packed all of his things the night before, and neatly made his bed. Remus\u2019s space was tidy only because it was now entirely empty except for his pyjamas and book by the bedside table. Peter had apparently tried to pack at some point, but been disturbed halfway through \u2013 his trunk was flung open, various items of clothing hanging out of it, a pile of textbooks on his bed, and his red tie hanging from the frame. Sirius\u2019s bed was by far the worst. He must have come up looking for something at some point, because every draw in his dresser was open, his bedsheets had been ripped back, and his trunk stood completely empty.\nRemus grabbed his book bag and left straight away \u2013 he would think about it later. He wished he still had the invisibility cloak as he dodged Peeves once more. The poltergeist was in his element, diving into the piles of foam, then bursting out at unsuspecting students and teachers. Remus briefly remembered what McGonagall had said that morning about his father\n\u2018boggarts, poltergeists\u2026\u2019\nhe wondered what his father \u2013 his duelling champion, Ravenclaw father who had a temper \u2013 had thought of Peeves.\n\u201cGood afternoon, Madam Pince,\u201d Remus said, quietly and respectfully as he entered the library. It was almost entirely empty, and the pinched faced old librarian was sorting through a towering pile of recently returned books with her wand, firing them back to their shelves with great relish.\n\u201cLupin.\u201d She said, not even turning her head to greet him.\nHe placed his books carefully on the counter furthest from her.\nThough the library no longer frightened him, exactly, Remus was still pretty nervous around Madam Pince, who would clearly have preferred that no students be permitted to touch her precious books at all. \u201cIs that all of them?\u201d She said, sharply, \u201cI shall know, if not.\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely all of them.\u201d He said, backing away slowly.\n\u201cMr Pettigrew has not returned\nPoisonous plants of the British Isles,\nand the elder Mr Black has three overdue transfiguration books.\u201d\n\u201cOh, ok\u2026 um\u2026 I\u2019ll let them know when I see them.\u201d\n\u201cI shall be writing to their parents if I don\u2019t have them by five o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell them.\u201d He repeated, almost out of the door. Sighing with relief, he made his way to the hospital wing at a leisurely pace, fighting the urge to throw himself headlong into a snowball fight the Hufflepuffs were having against the Slytrherins with the foam.\nIt seemed that the spell was still going strong \u2013 even more bubbles were emanating from the bathrooms he passed, and if he wasn\u2019t much mistaken, they were growing larger. He had no idea where Sirius, James and Peter were at that moment, but he knew they had to be enjoying themselves immensely.\n\u201cRemus, dear!\u201d Madam Pomfrey smiled as he entered the hospital wing. \u201cThank you for stopping by \u2013 I know you\u2019d much rather be having fun with your friends today.\u201d\nHe shrugged with a small smile,\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cJust a few things before the summer begins, shall we go in my office?\u201d\nHe followed her in, and accepted the plate of biscuits she offered him gratefully \u2013 his stomach was growling from having missed lunch.\n\u201cNow,\u201d Madam Pomfrey sat down, conjuring up his patient notes from thin air, \u201cI\u2019ve tried contacting your Matron at St Edmund\u2019s a few times\u2026 it seems she\u2019s not clear on how the post works. Keeps trying to get me to speak to her on some muggle contraption. I told her, we don\u2019t\nhave\na telling-bone at Hogwarts, but I don\u2019t think she believes me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Remus stifled a laugh, \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cAnyway, between us we\u2019ve managed to agree that I shall be present before and after your confinement for both full moons. I\u2019ve explained to her that your condition has become\u2026 more difficult over the past year, but that there should be no danger to anyone else at the school.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Remus nodded. Now that he was used to the idea, he was quite glad Pomfrey would be there, however briefly, over the holidays. It would make the full moons slightly less grim, anyway.\n\u201cI want you to make sure you look after yourself in the meantime. Eat full meals and get a nice balance of rest and exercise.\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t have the heart to tell Madam Pomfrey that he had very little say in when he was allowed to rest and how often he exercised while he was living at St Edmunds. No one at Hogwarts seemed to understand what sort of an institution it was.\nAfter that, she checked on a few of his wounds from the previous moon to ensure they were healing properly, then performed some diagnostic spells. It was almost four o\u2019clock by the time he was walking back to Gryffindor for what felt like the hundredth time that day.\nFilch had had no success yet in taming the foam, but it had at least stopped spurting from every tap and drain in the castle.\u00a0 The others must have got bored and moved onto something else. As Remus climbed the tower, he saw a few students flying past the windows on their brooms. It was a gorgeous day outside, the other marauders were probably out there making the most of it too.\nHe got a shock when he reached the dorm.\n\u201cHiya Moony,\u201d James grinned at him. He was alone, on Sirius\u2019s side of the room. He was packing. \u201cNice job getting the umbrellas.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well done on the foam. Filch is fuming.\u201d He rubbed the back of his head, feeling awkward, \u201cWhere\u2019s Sirius?\u201d\n\u201cDoing something mental on his broom, I think. Thought I\u2019d sort this out for him.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want help?\u201d\n\u201cNah, don\u2019t worry. Didn\u2019t you want to read a book or something?\u201d\nRemus shrugged. He felt a bit embarrassed now. It seemed right that James do it, after all \u2013 James was Sirius\u2019s best\nbest\nfriend.\n\u201cS\u2019ok, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d He said, casually, as if it didn\u2019t matter much either way. \u201cYou know I hate flying.\u201d\n\u201cNice of you,\u201d James smiled easily, gathering up some of Sirius\u2019s mess and sorting it quickly. Remus started tidying up the records, stacking in alphabetical order because Sirius liked it that way. \u201cPut those in my trunk,\u201d James said, nodding at the box of records, \u201cThe muggle books too. Said I\u2019d look after them for him. Y\u2019know, the way things are with his mum and dad.\u201d\nRemus nodded, carrying them over to James\u2019s bed.\n\u201cGoing to be a rubbish summer, without you two,\u201d James remarked, sounding genuinely sorry.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus replied, not really sure what else to say.\n\u201cSirius thinks\u2026 he thinks he might not be coming back in September.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Remus looked up, suddenly, alarmed. James frowned,\n\u201cYeah, he reckons with this betrothal thing\u2026 they might send him to Durmstrang. Keep him out of trouble until they can get him married. Pretty drastic, I think, but I wouldn\u2019t put it past them.\u201d\n\u201cThe betrothal ceremony might not happen, though,\u201d Remus said, quickly, \u201cI have a feeling\u2026 I just feel like Narcissa won\u2019t let it happen.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to tell James anything yet \u2013 because James would tell Sirius, and Sirius might get annoyed that Remus went behind his back to talk to his family. And what if it didn\u2019t even work? He couldn\u2019t get anyone\u2019s hopes up.\n\u201cNarcissa?\u201d James looked at him curiously, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cI just know she doesn\u2019t want to marry Sirius any more than he wants to marry her, that\u2019s all.\u201d Remus shook his head. \u201cShall I pack his muggle magazines in your trunk too?\u201d\n* * *\n\u201cWhat a wonderful year it\u2019s been,\u201d Dumbledore beamed at the Great Hall as the final scraps of the end of year feast vanished from their plates. Remus was going to miss the food more than anything, and had had three helpings of pudding. Ravenclaw had won the house cup that year, and the hall was decked out in royal blue and bronze silk banners. Every time the Ravenclaw table had cheered during the meal, Remus had felt a tug behind his navel and thought of his father.\n\nDumbledore\u2019s speech continued, \u201cI am immensely proud of all of you, of course. Now we are all well fed, I have a few words I would like to say\u2026\u201d\n\u201cReady, lads,\u201d Sirius whispered under his breath, so low that only the marauders could hear. Dumbledore continued,\n\u201c\u2026congratulations once again to Ravenclaw\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNow!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026winning this year\u2019s house---\u201c\nThere was a shriek from the far end of the hall, and everyone spun around to watch every single goblet on the Ravenclaw table to suddenly spurt red and gold bubbles. They fired upward in great geysers, hitting the ceiling and bursting in a shower of bright droplets, which fell like rain onto the students below, staining their robes with streaks of Gryffindor crimson.\n\u201cKeep going!\u201d Sirius whispered, his voice high with excitement, as the marauders flicked their wands using every ounce of concentration. At once, the goblets on every other table erupted too, causing the same effect as students shrieked and began to duck for cover, their hair, skin and clothes staining vibrant red and gold.\nNot even the Gryffindor table had escaped \u2013 not wanting to miss out on the fun, James had insisted on it. Lily Evans had brought her umbrella, and grinned slyly at Remus as Mary and Marlene fought to cram underneath it with her. In the far corner of the hall, Remus caught sight of a furious Narcissa hiding underneath the table, her long white hair streaked with red and gold which clashed awfully with her porcelain complexion.\nShe was glaring at her wayward cousin so hard that Remus wondered how Sirius did not drop dead on the spot. But he comforted himself with the thought that this incident can only have cemented the idea in her mind that she must escape marriage to Sirius at all costs.\n\u201c\nOmnistratum\n!\u201d Dumbledore said, calmly, aiming his wand at the ceiling.\nAt once, the bubbles burst and evaporated into nothing, as though a large force field had suddenly appeared over their heads. \u201cScourgify!\u201d The headmaster smiled pleasantly, now waving his wand over the whole hall. Instantly, the red and gold paint had vanished from the tables, floor and students. Order was restored.\n\u201cAw.\u201d James sighed, sounding disappointed.\n\u201cAn excellent way to celebrate Gryffindor\u2019s victory on the quidditch pitch this year,\u201d Dumbledore cleared his throat, as students clambered back into their seats, eyeing their goblets nervously. \u201cAnd while I welcome and encourage displays of house pride, I would like everyone to remember that true sportsmanship lies in the ability to gracefully cede victory. Please join me in raising your glasses to Ravenclaw, winners of the Hogwarts house cup 1973.\u201d\nRemus had the uncomfortable feeling that though Dumbledore did not look in the marauder\u2019s direction, they were absolutely the intended audience for this admonishment. He felt a little ashamed \u2013 but only a very little. It was hard to feel too sorry when there had really been no harm done, and he was so full of excellent food.\nJames and Sirius were already planning next year\u2019s finale, Peter grinning and nodding along like a simpleton. Lily winked at Remus as they raised their goblets, and he hoped that nothing would ever change."

            "content": "Saturday 30\nth\nJune 1973\nDear Remus,\nI\u2019ve only been back at my parents\u2019 house for half an hour and I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m bringing shame to my family five times. Five. Three of those times weren\u2019t even from living people \u2013 the portraits of our ancestors have decided to have a go.\nGoing to start putting up my Gryffindor stuff now, I think.\nHope you got home ok.\nSirius O. Black\n* * *\nDear Sirius,\nYour owl arrived before I even got back \u2013 we had to get two tubes and a bus, it took ages.\nSorry about the family stuff. Be careful. Wish we were all back at school.\nRemus.\n* * *\nFriday 13\nth\nJuly 1973\nDear Moony,\nCome and visit soon, me and Peter will die of boredom!\nDon\u2019t send Sirius any owls \u2013 his mother intercepted mine and returned them all with curses attached! Luckily dad spotted it before we had any trouble, but bloody hell! I might try contacting his cousin Andromeda to see how she gets post through. I think it\u2019s the muggle way, but Godrick knows how we\u2019re supposed to understand that \u2013 I haven\u2019t even opened my muggle studies books yet.\nLet me know if you can come and visit. Remember mum said any time. We can talk to your Matron, and Madam Pomfrey \u2013 the Minister for Magic, if we have to!\nJames.\n* * *\nDear James,\nI know how the post works, but I\u2019d have to nick some stamps. And I don\u2019t what Sirius\u2019s address is.\nI asked Pomfrey after the last moon \u2013 she said no. She said the wizarding world is too dangerous for me. I don\u2019t know if she means I\u2019m the one that\u2019s dangerous.\nSorry mate.\nMoony.\n* * *\nSunday 5\nth\nAugust 1973\nDear Moony,\nSo. You will not believe what happened. Seriously. The ceremony was all ready to go \u2013 I was in my hideous green dress robes (with black lace cuffs \u2013\nLACE\n, Moony. Just wrap your mind around that. You would have thought I looked a right prat.) Regulus was there, my mother, father, half the family.\nThen in comes Narcissa, wearing something that looked like it belonged to my grandmother. And she doesn\u2019t look happy, so I thought \u2013 well, fair enough, I\u2019m not exactly thrilled. But then she stands up, in front of\neveryone\nand says \u201cWe have to stop at once.\u201d\nSo, everyone stops, and my mother looks like she\u2019s about to start spitting curses, and my uncle is asking Narcissa \u201cwhat do you think you\u2019re playing at\u201d and Regulus is grinning at me and Bellatrix is grinning too, only she looks a bit more mental than Reg. Then Narcissa whispers something to her parents and my aunt LITERALLY FAINTED. I shit you not. And everyone\u2019s muttering and whispering, and mother can\u2019t take it anymore and demands to know what\u2019s going on, so Narcissa stands up, and LOOKS MY MOTHER IN THE EYE and tells her.\nShe made an unbreakable vow to marry Lucius Malfoy as soon as she finishes her NEWTs.\nI can\u2019t remember if I told you what an unbreakable vow is, but basically she can\u2019t\nnot\nmarry Malfoy now \u2013 or else they both drop dead. I don\u2019t know if I should be a bit offended on that point, to be honest. I mean what does it say about you when a girl would rather die than marry you, even if she is your cousin?\nAnyway, as you can probably imagine, the whole Black family is at war, no one is talking to each other because a few curses ended up being thrown between my dad and my uncle. I can\u2019t believe Narcissa. Seriously, I actually got close to liking her for a second before I remembered she\u2019s still a Black,\nand\na Slytherin,\nand\nshe wants to marry Lucius slimy git Malfoy, of all people.\nBut it looks like I\u2019m off the hook. There aren\u2019t any other cousins left for me to marry now. Everyone\u2019s furious, obviously, but for once no one\u2019s furious at me. I think I\u2019ll probably be coming back to Hogwarts in September \u2013 I heard mum talk about making Reg the heir instead. No skin off my nose, I couldn\u2019t care less about inheriting this foul house or their foul fortune. Rather they just leave me alone and keep ignoring me forever.\nHope your holiday is going as well as mine (though I can\u2019t see how it can be, because \u2013 honestly, what a bloody result, eh Moony??)\nSee you in a few weeks,\nSirius O. Black\n* * *\nMonday 6\nth\nAugust 1973\nDear Moony,\nI bet Sirius has already told you the news, but just in case he hasn\u2019t \u2013 THE BETROTHAL IS OFF! You were right, it came down to Narcissa in the end. Uncanny ability you have there, Remu ol\u2019 pal, don\u2019t fancy giving me odds on the quidditch world cup next year, do you?\nHaving a really boring summer all by myself. Pete\u2019s lot are all off seeing their French relatives, so I don\u2019t even have anyone to help me practice my catches. Hope yours isn\u2019t too bad. I had a thought that maybe you could ask Madam Pomfrey to bring you to Diagon Alley in August? Or maybe we could meet you and drop you back after? Mum keeps asking after you, she\u2019d love to see you again.\nGet in touch if you can.\nYours in eternal boredom,\nJames.\n* * *\nMonday 13\nth\nAugust 1973\n[Postcard depicting the Eiffel Tower in spring]\nDear Remus,\nBonjour and all that from Paris!\nHope your holidays are good. Wish you lot were here.\nPeter.\n* * *\nRemus responded to each of these communications with vigour, much moreso than he had the year before. The marauders had seen enough of his handwriting to know how wonky it was, and he didn\u2019t think they\u2019d mind a few spelling mistakes. He told James he was very sorry, but he could not come to Diagon Alley (Madam Pomfrey said that wasn\u2019t safe either, and wouldn\u2019t tell him why) and he congratulated Sirius on his hard-won bachelorhood, but did not tell him that he, Remus, had anything to do with it. It would be too much like boasting, and he didn\u2019t want Sirius to feel like he owed him anything.\nRemus\u2019s own summer was perhaps just as boring as James and Sirius\u2019s, but filled with more purpose than any summer before it. Madam Pomfrey was true to her word and arrived the evening before and the morning after each full moon. As such, he spent less time covered in bandages, and had more time to read and plan for his year ahead.\nWhen his books arrived courtesy of Dumbledore and the Hogwarts second hand bin, Remus was thrilled to be able to get a head start on his reading. Arithmancy was very difficult, but the challenge was exciting \u2013 and Care of Magical Creatures was utterly absorbing, if only because of the fantastic colour illustrations.\nEven Matron commented \u2013 somewhat suspiciously \u2013 that Remus had changed a great deal after two years away at school.\n\u201cNice to see you\u2019re keeping out of trouble.\u201d She said one morning, when she found him sitting at the bottom of the garden reading a heavy textbook using his magical sheet of acetate. At the time, Remus simply squinted up at her and smiled benignly. She of course had no idea that before the summer was over he was to have committed his first serious crime.\nEver since his Christmas with the Potters, Remus had been plagued with one particular problem, and he wasn\u2019t sure how best to overcome it. Money. He didn\u2019t have any \u2013 muggle or wizard, Remus was as poor as you could possibly be. This had never mattered a great deal \u2013 after all, St Edmund\u2019s supplied his basic needs, and Hogwarts gave him everything else.\nBut. But. He would have liked, at the very least, to be able to return the generosity his friends had shown him. They\u2019d bought him countless sweets and gifts; Sirius had given him the ability to read, for goodness\u2019 sake, and Lily had singlehandedly rescued his summer. For some time now, Remus had resolved to seek out the soonest opportunity that might result in payment.\nFortunately for Remus, this opportunity presented itself one hot June afternoon. He was reading again, of course, sitting outside on a bench under the shade of an old pub umbrella which must have been donated at some point since his first year. Now was he was thirteen, while Remus was not among the eldest boys at St Edmund\u2019s, he was no longer at the bottom of the pile, and could generally escape being picked on too badly.\nA shadow fell over his book, and he looked up. Craig Newman, a sixteen-year-old skinhead, glared down at him. Craig\u2019s gang was the top of the pecking order at St Eddy\u2019s. They all listened to reggae, wore bovver boots and drainpipe jeans held up by suspenders. Some of them had tattoos, and all of them had bruises.\n\u201cOrright, Lupin.\u201d Craig grunted at him. Remus blinked, slowly closing his book and wondering if it was much good as a weapon. It was heavy, anyway.\n\u201cOrright, Newman.\u201d He nodded, trying not to look small and scared. He slipped naturally back into his old accent over the summer, slurring words and dropping consonants. It was safest.\n\u201c\u2019t\u2019chu readin?\u201d Craig squinted down at the book, looking mistrustful. Remus wondered if Craig could read. He shrugged, nonchalantly,\n\u201cJus\u2019 summink for school.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Craig nodded. Remus didn\u2019t move a muscle. He couldn\u2019t understand what was happening \u2013 did Craig really just want a casual chat? \u201cYou\u2019re clever, in\u2019t ya?\u201d The older boy said, suddenly.\nRemus didn\u2019t know which response was more likely to get him beaten up, so he didn\u2019t answer at all. No matter, Craig didn\u2019t seem to mind. He just scratched his chin, then pulled a packet of cigarettes out of his shirt sleeve. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re clever. Always readin\u2019 an\u2019 that.\u201d He lit the cigarette with a match from hit boot, then offered Remus the packet.\nRemus reached out and took one. He\u2019d never smoked before, but most of the boys at St Edmund\u2019s did. Craig lit it for him, and Remus inhaled. His eyes filled with tears at once, and he tried desperately not to cough and splutter. It was disgusting.\nCraig looked at him with some amusement and continued. \u201cSmall, too. Skinny, like.\u201d\n\u201cI s\u2019pose.\u201d Remus replied, coughing, watching Craig inhale and then trying to copy him.\n\u201cFancy comin\u2019 on a job?\u201d\n\u201cJob?\u201d\nCraig nodded, his tiny eyes fixed on Remus.\n\u201cYeah. you\u2019d be good. Gonna do over the offie in town. Tomorrow night. Ain\u2019t got no security. Ain\u2019t got nuffink, c\u2019ept a dog. Goin\u2019 after the till and the booze. You can have a share. Just need to pop you through the back window.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Remus nodded, as if the prospect did not utterly terrify him. He sucked on the cigarette again, out of habit this time. He could sort of see the appeal, once you got over the taste. He considered Craig\u2019s suggestion.\nOn the one hand, it was bloody dangerous. Newman\u2019s gang weren\u2019t known for their finesse, and a few of them were already on probation. On the other hand, it did not seem as though he had much choice. When Craig Newman wanted you to do something, you sort of just had to do it. \u00a0Plus, he could definitely benefit. Muggle money was all but useless to him, of course, but there might be a way\u2026\nRemus looked Craig Newman in his little piggy eyes.\n\u201cI just want fags.\u201d\nCraig smirked and nodded. And so, Remus began his short career as a burglar."

            "content": "In the corner of the morning in the past\nI would sit and blame the master first and last\nAll the roads were straight and narrow\nAnd the prayers were small and yellow\nAnd the rumour spread that I was aging fast\nThen I ran across a monster who was sleeping\n\n\nBy a tree\n\nAnd I looked and frowned and the monster was me\nSaturday 1\nst\nSeptember 1973\nAfter the first job, Craig and his gang had been so pleased with Remus that they\u2019d taken him along on four more, to houses and small businesses in the surrounding towns. Even without an invisibility cloak, Remus found that he just had a natural gift for getting into places he shouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s what Craig said anyway; \u201cBloody natural, this kid.\u201d\nNature was a funny thing, Remus found himself thinking, on the way to King\u2019s Cross. He remembered James leaving a bag of coins behind every time they raided Honeyduke\u2019s. It was not in James\u2019s nature to steal, it seemed. But Remus didn\u2019t think this was a particularly fair assessment, when James had never\nneeded\nto steal. He was the heir to an enormous fortune, just like Sirius. And the truth was, you just never knew what you were capable of until you tried it. It must be very easy to be good when you had no reason\nnot\nto be.\nStill, Remus had resolved never to tell the other marauders what he\u2019d got up to that summer, and spent the rest of his journey daydreaming about all of the Christmas and birthday presents he would finally be able to buy his friends.\nRemus\u2019s Hogwarts trunk this year was stuffed full of cigarette boxes and pouches of tobacco. Plenty to get a little business up and running \u2013 if he was savvy enough, he might be rid of most of it before Christmas. They were allowed to go to Hogsmeade this year, and Matron had signed his permission slip without a fuss \u2013 even Madam Pomfrey thought it was probably safe enough for him to go.\nMatron, it seemed, had learnt her lesson. She accompanied Remus as far as King\u2019s Cross, then left him there, with a curt goodbye. Heart pounding as much as it had two years ago, Remus flew at the ticket barrier, and exhaled only once he arrived safely on the other side. He was home again.\nIt did not take him long to spy Sirius, who was slouching against a station pillar beside his family. Mrs Black was fussing over Regulus, who looked paler than usual and was standing with his back very straight as Walpurga combed his hair and hissed in his ear. She was obviously ignoring her eldest son, whose hair looked deliberately messy, and whose robes were artfully rumpled and out of place. Remus thought it best not to approach.\n\u201cHiya Moony,\u201d he was clapped on the back and turned around to see James and Peter grinning at him. James had grown a few inches, and his face looked slightly thinner, but he had the same bright brown eyes and the same mop of black hair. Peter looked himself, though he seemed to be recovering from a rather painful sunburn.\n\u201cHi,\u201d Remus grinned back at them, his heart leaping with excitement. Everything just as it should be.\nThe whistle blew, and they climbed onto the train to find an empty compartment and wait for Sirius. He was finally allowed to join them at what seemed like the very last minute, and entered the car muttering darkly to himself,\n\u201cKeeping up appearances\nmy arse\n.\u201d\n\u201cNo change there, then,\u201d James winked at Remus. Sirius looked at them all and his face split into a smile. That Sirius Black smile.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d never see you all again!\u201d\n\u201cGodrick, you always have to be so dramatic.\u201d James punched him on the shoulder, as they all stood up to greet him.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what she\u2019s like,\u201d Sirius whined, clasping James\u2019s hand in a warm, brotherly handshake. Then he saw Remus and smirked mischievously, \u201cIs that you, Moony?!\u201d He deliberately craned his neck, raising a hand as if to shield his eyes and peering up, \u201cCan you hear me up there??\u201d\n\u201cHa ha.\u201d Remus replied, shifting uncomfortably. \u201cI\u2019m the same height as James.\u201d\n\u201cNot any more you\u2019re not,\u201d James countered, standing closer to Remus so that he could see that he was indeed half an inch taller than the dark-haired boy.\n\u201cYeah, how did I end up mates with two beanpoles, eh?\u201d Sirius grinned, slapping Remus on the back playfully, \u201cLucky I\u2019ve got you, eh Petey-boy?\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d Peter looked up from his pasty, confused. Peter Pettigrew looked no taller than he had been when they were all eleven, though he was considerably wider.\nSirius appeared to be growing up gracefully and in perfect proportion, which was just typical. He was a little taller, but not lanky like James, slender, but not skinny like Remus. His jaw had broadened over the summer too, the shadow of manhood rising in his features.\n\u201cRight,\u201d James rubbed his hands together as they all sat down, \u201cNow all that\u2019s out of the way \u2013 I say we move onto new business. Plans for the year?\u201d\n\u201cWe have to finish the map,\u201d Remus said, quickly. That had been playing on his mind for some time. \u201cIt\u2019s not far off, and I bet we can figure out that homunculus charm if we really put the effort in.\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely,\u201d James said, \u201cThe map is basically our legacy, right? We\u2019ll work on it, I promise.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that other thing,\u201d Sirius suddenly said, very sharply. James and Peter exchanged glances, and Remus felt a knot tighten in his stomach.\n\u201cWhat \u2018other\u2019 thing?\u201d He asked, frowning.\nJames looked him in the eye, looking very serious.\n\u201cJust something we were talking about last year. We\u2019ll um\u2026 we\u2019ll let you know if we decide to go through with it.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t want to get you into trouble, Moony,\u201d Peter laughed, nervously, \u201cLess you know the better, eh?\u201d\nRemus took umbrage to this. Hadn\u2019t he got away with participating in most of last year\u2019s pranks,\nand\nhad the least detentions? And hadn\u2019t he been the only one who\u2019d even attempted to talk to Narcissa about Sirius\u2019s family problems? Of course, the others didn\u2019t know about that \u2013 if they had a secret, he could have one too. He looked out of the window, testily, ignoring the rest of the conversation.\nFinally, Peter sighed heavily,\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the trolley witch? I\u2019m\nhungry\n.\u201d\n\u201cI just saw you finish a pasty.\u201d James replied, mildly annoyed because he\u2019d been midway through explaining his plan to bewitch all the Slytherin quidditch team\u2019s brooms during their next practice.\n\u201cYeah, but I fancy something sweet.\u201d Peter pouted, emptying out his pockets and only coming up with empty wrappers.\nRemus saw his chance and finally cheered up a bit,\n\u201cI\u2019ve got you sorted, Pete,\u201d he dug into his suitcase and pulled out a handful of chocolate bars, dumping them on the empty seat beside him. The other three boys stared at the pile.\n\u201cWhat are these?\u201d Sirius picked up a Mars bar, looking suspicious.\n\u201cMuggle chocolate,\u201d Remus said, \u201cThey\u2019re good! Go on, won\u2019t bite.\u201d\nPeter had already unwrapped and bitten into a Milky Way, and was grinning encouragingly at the others. Remus selected a packet of Maltesers for himself, sitting back with satisfaction knowing that for once he had brought the snacks on the train.\n* * *\nRemus noticed that they were sitting further away from the teacher\u2019s table when they took their places for the feast. The first and second years now below them, the marauders found themselves no longer among the youngest students, which gave them an unnecessary sense of pride and achievement.\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking Runes, aren\u2019t you Remus?\u201d Lily asked, plonking herself down next to him. She had cut her hair over the summer, and had a soft fringe which made her look a bit like Jane Asher.\n\u201cYep,\u201d he nodded.\n\u201cMoony\u2019s abandoning us!\u201d Sirius wailed, comically, pretending to fall onto James\u2019s shoulder, sobbing inconsolably,\n\u201cThere, there,\u201d James patted his friend\u2019s back, solemnly, \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy, Remus,\u201d he scolded, \u201cAll very well you moving on to bigger and better things, but think about us little people you\u2019re leaving behind.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving anyone behind,\u201d Remus muttered, his ears turning red, \u201cJust didn\u2019t fancy divination.\u201d\n\u201cIgnore them,\u201d Lily said, primly, casting a disapproving look at Sirius and James, who were now holding each other, still pretending to weep hysterically as though their hearts were irreparably broken. Lily tutted, seeing she had no effect, and turned back to Remus, \u201cYou lot don\u2019t have to be attached at the hip all the time. Anyway, I\u2019m doing Runes too, have you done the pre-reading?\u201d\nRemus nodded enthusiastically,\n\u201cYeah, it looks really interesting.\u201d\n\u201cAha!\u201d Sirius looked up, slyly, \u201c\nNow\nI see.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Remus asked, nervously. Sirius had that wicked, unpredictable look in his eyes.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it has anything to do with furthering your academic career,\u201d he scratched his chin, wisely, \u201c\nI\nthink our dear Remoony has been lured away from everyone\u2019s favourite doss subject by the fairer sex!\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Remus blushed harder, trying not to look at Lily. Sirius always knew exactly the most embarrassing thing to say.\n\u201cYeah, shut up, Black,\u201d Lily sighed, \u201cHonestly you lot can\u2019t even be nice to each other. Just because no girls would come near you with a five-foot barge pole\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know I was very recently engaged to be married,\u201d Sirius replied, with a swish of his dark hair. James was snorting with laughter now, shoulders shaking.\n\u201cWhat else are you taking, Remus?\u201d Lily asked, pointedly ignoring the other marauders.\n\u201cCare of Magical Creatures,\u201d Remus sighed. He\u2019d already had enough jokes about that from James and Sirius.\n\u201cOooh!\u201d Marlene turned around suddenly, \u201cMe and Mary are taking that!\u201d\n\u201cA-HA!\u201d Sirius said again, even louder, and James completely fell apart.\nFortunately, the sorting began then and the hall fell silent. The ceremony was extremely dull unless you were involved in it, Remus found, and he struggled to hold back a yawn as the line of frightened first years gradually grew shorter, and the spaces at the top of the Gryffindor table filled up with new students. His attention wandered and he gazed over at the Slytherin table, where Narcissa was sitting at the far end, regal as a queen and looking much more cheerful than when he\u2019d last seen her.\nRegulus, now a second year, sat at the other end from his cousin, looking as bored as Remus felt. Then there was Snape, among the third year Slytherins, staring at Lily, as usual. He caught her eye once or twice and Remus saw her smile at him in her usual friendly way, but it didn\u2019t seem to brighten Severus\u2019s mood one bit. Only Lily could remain friends with someone that miserable, Remus thought to himself.\nThe feast, when it appeared, was as delicious and welcome as ever. Remus had his customary two helpings of everything, including pudding and once the meal was finished, Dumbledore gave his usual speech. For the past two years, Remus had switched off for this portion of the evening \u2013 being too full of good food and too sleepy from the long day to pay much attention. But something about the serious tone of the headmaster\u2019s usually playful oration made him listen.\nHe saw that he was not the only one. There was a low, ominous muttering from the Slytherin table, particularly those in the upper years. The Gryffindors around Remus seemed to straighten up a little more, too.\n\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d Remus asked, as they left the hall for their dorms, Dumbledore\u2019s confusing warnings ringing in his ears, \u201c\u2019Unity in the face of darkness,\u2019 and all that?\u201d\n\u201cOh right, you won\u2019t know\u2026\u201d James said, quietly. He looked at Sirius, who was scuffing his feet, hands in his pockets. \u201cTell you when we\u2019re alone, ok?\u201d\nThey waited to get that year\u2019s password (\u2018\nCodswallop\u2019\n) and headed straight up the stairs to their familiar dorm room. All of their beds were made, their trunks sitting by, and Remus felt a surge of happiness as he entered. Sirius began to unpack at once, pulling his beloved muggle records and books from James\u2019s trunk. James only unpacked his broom, and began to polish it lovingly, sitting cross-legged on his bed.\n\u201cSo?\u201d Remus asked, impatiently, \u201cThe weird speech?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d James swallowed. He glanced at Sirius again, who appeared to be ignoring them. James sighed, running his hands through his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s all politics, really.\u201d\n\u201cPolitics?\u201d Remus groaned inwardly. He didn\u2019t know much about muggle politics, let alone whatever went on in the wizarding world \u2013 other than the statute of secrecy, which they had covered in first year History. There was a referendum coming up about Britain joining the European Community \u2013 but that wasn\u2019t for a few years, if Remus had understood the prime minister\u2019s speeches correctly, and he couldn\u2019t see how that affected wizards very much.\n\u201cWell, you know there are\u2026 um\u2026 well, dark wizards?\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Remus tried to look knowledgeable. He remembered reading something briefly about Grindelwald, but they wouldn\u2019t be studying that until their OWLs.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a surge in dark magic lately, that\u2019s all. And my dad told me\u2026 there\u2019s some stuff going on at the ministry. Department heads pushing for stricter reforms against muggleborn wizards and\u2026 people who are different. Dad said it was nothing to worry about, just the usual old prejudices. But I s\u2019pose Dumbledore thinks we need to be on our guard.\u201d\n\u201cMother and Father called a meeting.\u201d Sirius said, suddenly. They both turned to look at him. He looked tormented, ashamed, and would not meet their eyes. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let me in, obviously, but Reg went. They keep talking about this Dark Lord \u2013 I dunno, maybe a politician they want to back in the next election. All I know is if the Blacks are supporting him then he can\u2019t be good.\u201d\nEven James didn\u2019t have anything positive to say in light of this announcement. They were all quiet, until Peter spoke up.\n\u201cWe\u2019re at Hogwarts.\u201d He said, \u201cMy mum always says Hogwarts is the safest place in Britain. And we\u2019ve got Dumbledore.\u201d He said firmly, settling the matter. \u201cC\u2019mon, Black, bet you\u2019ve got another awful muggle record you\u2019re just\ndying\nto assault our ears with.\u201d\nThey all looked at Peter with mild surprise. Sirius grinned,\n\u201cActually,\u201d he said, dusting off his record player, \u201cI have.\u201d"

            "summary_and_notes": "",
            "content": "Friday 7\nth\nSeptember 1973\nBy the end of his first week of third year, Remus felt like he needed another two months just to recover \u2013 and there hadn\u2019t even been a full moon yet. He felt foolish for not considering that adding three extra subjects to his timetable would also increase his workload. But of course it did, and by the time Friday rolled around he felt weighted down by the amount of homework to be completed over the weekend.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d Peter whined, \u201cThis year was supposed to be fun, with Hogsmeade and everything.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll still go to Hogsmeade, Peter,\u201d James murmured over a complicated looking star chart.\n\u201cI\u2019m with Pete,\u201d Sirius groaned, screwing up his dream diary for Divination, \u201cLet\u2019s sack this off and go and use the quidditch pitch while it\u2019s still light.\u201d\nJames looked up, eagerly,\n\u201cYeah, go on then.\u201d\nAll three of them stood.\n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Remus said, absentmindedly. He was actually quite enjoying his Transfiguration homework \u2013 an essay on bodily transformations. He was pretty good at basic modifications now, for covering up scars, and was able to answer the questions at length.\n\u201cDon\u2019t fancy looking over my muggle studies, do you, Moony?\u201d Sirius asked, matily. Remus raised his eyebrows.\n\u201cIf I have time. James, Pete, want me to look at yours?\u201d\n\u201cThanks Remus!\u201d Peter grinned, tying up his shoelaces.\n\u201cNah,\u201d James refused, \u201cThought I might ask Evans for a bit of help on it later.\u201d\n\u201cLosing battle, mate,\u201d Sirius counselled. \u201cDunno why you\u2019re so hung up on her.\u201d\nJames just shrugged, not looking at all discouraged.\nRemus spent a satisfying hour or two by himself, completing the rest of his work for the week. He\u2019d made a start on Potions, but thought it could bear leaving for a little bit longer \u2013 Peter could give him a hand in exchange for the muggle studies comprehension homework. They had double Potions on Mondays now, first thing \u2013 but thankfully no longer with the Slytherins. In fact, the only class they shared with Slytherin now was Arithmancy, and that wasn\u2019t a practical subject, so there was much less space for open house-warfare.\nArithmancy was a real surprise to Remus \u2013 he had expected to fall behind Sirius and James, at least at first. But it appeared that this subject was down to logic, rather than magical ability, and Remus had found his first lesson to be shockingly straightforward. The homework, which he knew Sirius and James had not yet attempted, was to calculate their own heart and character numbers using the Agrippan method. This he actually found quite soothing, though he knew he would never admit it to anyone.\nHerbology plodded along at its usual pace \u2013 Remus couldn\u2019t pretend to be all that interested in it, but at least it wasn\u2019t difficult. Astronomy was not his strongest subject either, but luckily Peter was generally so thrilled to be the only one who knew something that he gave Remus most of the answers for nothing.\nThen there was his new favourite subject; Care of Magical Creatures, on Wednesdays and Thursdays. He wasn\u2019t going to tell the others about that either \u2013 they already teased him for liking History so much,\nand\nfor taking Runes. All good natured, of course \u2013 he made fun of them for doing Divination, which by the sounds of it was pretty dire.\nHe had read his copy of\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\ntwice other the summer \u2013 it had been his favourite bedtime reading. The pictures and descriptions were so vivid they filled his dreams with the most spectacular images. There had been nothing in the set text \u2013 Remus was sure to check this \u2013 about werewolves. Fortunately, they weren\u2019t considered in the same league as \u2018magical creatures\u2019, and it looked as though they weren\u2019t going to be studying \u2018half-humans\u2019 until next year in Defence Against the Dark Arts.\n\u201cI hope we do unicorns,\u201d Marlene sighed, leaning against the wall as they queued outside the classroom for their first lesson. \u201cSomething really nice, like that.\u201d\nMary raised an eyebrow,\n\u201cI\u2019d rather do dragons. Something a bit exciting!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad we don\u2019t have Kettleburn.\u201d Marlene replied. This made Remus pay attention,\n\u201cDon\u2019t we? Who\u2019ve we got, then?\u201d\n\u201cWeren\u2019t you paying attention to Dumbledore at the feast?\u201d Marlene looked at him disapprovingly. \u201cKettleburn\u2019s off in Romania or Bulgaria or something, doing some work for the ministry. I dunno how useful he this, though, he\u2019s not exactly in one piece...\u201d\n\u201cSo who\u2019ve we got?\u201d\n\u201cWhoever it is wasn\u2019t at the feast,\u201d Marlene shrugged, \u201cBut my timetable says \u2018Professor L. Ferox\u2019.\u201d\nAs she said this, the classroom door opened and the fifth years ahead of them filed out, chatting animatedly. The Gryffindor third years went inside, and Remus took a desk by the window, next to Marlene. When the teacher emerged from his office, both Mary and Marlene \u2013 and, actually, every other girl in the class \u2013 sat up a little straighter.\nHe was a good deal younger than Kettleburn, who had been a bit grizzled, even in his middle age. Remus would have guessed this teacher to be in his early thirties. He still had all of his limbs, too, which was a definite plus. His hair was thick and sandy blond, long enough to reach hallway down his back. He wasn\u2019t dressed in robes like most teachers, but practical, out-doorsy clothes and heavy brown leather boots. He had a slightly weather-beaten face, which served to give his strong features a kind of rugged appeal. His eyes were bright blue, and gleamed as he smiled warmly at the class,\n\u201cGood afternoon!\u201d He boomed, in a gruff Liverpudlian accent. He clapped his large calloused hands together, \u201cWelcome to your first year of Care of Magical Creatures. I\u2019m Professor Ferox. You\u2019ve all got the Scamander text, I hope?\u201d\nThe class immediately pulled out their copies of\nFantastic Beasts\n, along with parchment and quills, then looked up at him attentively. Professor Ferox continued to beam at them all.\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d He continued, \u201cA cracking read, as I\u2019m sure some of you have already discovered. It gives you a nice, comprehensive guide to identifying and encountering most of the well-known magical creatures \u2013 but what it\ncan\u2019t\ngive you \u2013 and what you\u2019ll need to excel in this class \u2013 is quick thinking, cool-headedness, and nerves of steel.\u201d\nSome of the girls tittered at this, and Remus felt a flutter of excitement.\nSee James\n, he thought ruefully,\nit\u2019s\nnot\na girly subject\n. He wasn\u2019t sure about the specifications, though. He had enough nerve, maybe \u2013 had to, after the summer he\u2019d had \u2013 but cool-headedness was hardly one of his defining traits.\n\u201cNow,\u201d Ferox clapped his hands together, as if eager to begin. He bent under his desk, \u201cLook what I\u2019ve got for you\u2026\u201d When he rubbed his palms the rough skin made a soft \u2018shh\u2019 sound \u2013 he obviously didn\u2019t spend a lot of time inside, Remus thought to himself \u2013 Professor Ferox was clearly a man of action.\nThe teacher was now lifting a large wicker basket, setting it gently down on his desk. He opened it, and a large, furry creature stalked out. It was the biggest cat Remus had ever seen \u2013 with bushy silver fur patterned with dark spots, high pointed ears and a strange brush tail like a lion. It mewed, rather grumpily, then hopped up to sit on top of the basket so that it was almost eye level with Ferox. It glared imperiously down at the class, flicking it\u2019s tail back and forth.\nProfessor Ferox stroked a long finger down the animal\u2019s back, which it appeared to tolerate, blinking slowly.\n\u201cCan anyone tell me what sort of creature Achilles here is?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cat.\u201d Mary said, bluntly, without raising her hand.\nFerox laughed cheerily,\n\u201cA common mistake, Miss\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cMacdonald. Mary Macdonald.\u201d\n\u201cMiss Macdonald. No, Achilles is not a cat \u2013 though they are often interbred.\u201d\n\u201cOoh!\u201d A Ravenclaw boy at the back of the room raised his hand,\n\u201cYes, Mr\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cStan Brooks, sir. Is it a kneazle, sir?\u201d\n\u201cFive points to Ravenclaw!\u201d Ferox nodded enthusiastically, \u201cAchilles is a kneazle.\u201d\nRemus sighed, inwardly. He knew that \u2013 he ought to have known it, anyway, he could remember reading about the tail. Mentally he struck \u2018quick thinking\u2019 off the list of Ferox\u2019s requirements. Hoping to show the professor that he was at least eager to learn, Remus began to take notes as Ferox spoke, still stroking Achilles absentmindedly.\n\u201cYou can always identify a kneazle by its cat-like appearance, high level of intelligence, speckled fur and plumed tail,\u201d the teacher said, indicating these features lovingly, \u201cThey are classified XXX by the ministry of magic \u2013 can anyone tell me what that means?\u201d\nRemus\u2019s hand shot up, this time, but so did Marlene\u2019s. Ferox picked her, asking her name as he did so.\n\u201cMarlene McKinnon,\u201d She smiled up at him, \u201cSir. XXX classified creatures are not recommended for domestication, but should not prove difficult for a qualified wizard to handle.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent. Five points to Gryffindor.\u201d Ferox tipped his head.\nRemus fumed, silently. She\u2019d read that straight from the book. Ferox carried on, \u201cWe will be focussing on XXX classified creatures for the rest of the year. Now, while it\u2019s true that kneazles are not recommended as pets \u2013 this is not because they are dangerous. In fact, anyone who tells you they\u2019re dangerous has likely found themselves on the wrong side of one, and should not be trusted. Can anyone tell me why?\u201d\nRemus\u2019s hand flew up again \u2013 it was all coming back to him now. But Ferox picked another Ravenclaw, this time.\n\u201cBecause they can detect suspicious people.\u201d Davy Kirk piped up, earning another five points for Ravenclaw.\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d The Professor smiled, \u201cKneazles are excellent judges of characters, and will react fiercely to anyone untrustworthy. As such, the ministry requires kneazle owners to hold the proper licence and have undergone certain proficiency tests. But as you can see,\u201d he stroked Achilles once more. The silver cat had barely moved a muscle, except to survey the class, \u201cThey do make wonderful pets, as long as they are shown proper respect and care.\u201d\n\u201cIs he yours then, professor?\u201d Mary asked, batting her eyelashes flirtatiously, \u201cHe\u2019s\nlovely\n.\u201d\n\u201cHe is indeed,\u201d Ferox replied, \u201cIf you\u2019re all careful and don\u2019t crowd him, Achilles will probably let you stroke him. Line up, class.\u201d\nThere was a general murmuring and scraping of chairs as everyone got to their feet and formed a queue. Remus made sure he was at the very back, so that maybe the lesson would end before he got to the front. Achilles was sure to hate him \u2013 werewolves were the very definition of untrustworthy.\n\u201cApproach him slowly, and don\u2019t avoid eye contact. If he tries to go for you he\u2019ll use his claws, so keep alert\u2026 there we go, he\u2019ll let you stroke him now, nice and gently\u2026\u201d\nAs the queue shortened, the professor continued talking, giving them encouragement and interesting facts, interwoven with his own anecdotes. Remus didn\u2019t know what Ferox had done before becoming a teacher, but he\u2019d certainly had some adventures \u2013 travelled everywhere, it sounded like.\nFinally, Remus was at the front of the queue. He felt frozen to the spot, looking at the yellow eyed animal nervously,\n\u201cCome on then \u2013 what was your name?\u201d Professor Ferox beckoned him forward. Remus didn\u2019t move.\n\u201cRemus Lupin. I\u2019m not\u2026 um\u2026 cats don\u2019t tend to like me.\u201d He mumbled.\n\u201cAchilles is not a cat.\u201d The teacher said, still smiling. \u201cCome on Lupin, up you come.\u201d\nRemus sighed heavily and approached. He didn\u2019t want someone as cool as Ferox to think he was a wuss. Achilles watched him walk forward. It did look very intelligent, there was something in the eyes, even though it had a very ugly snubbed nose. He reached his hand out, allowing the kneazle to sniff at him. Its claws weren\u2019t out, but Remus was willing to bet they were very long and very sharp. He\u2019d been scratched by cats before and had never really liked them. \u00a0\u201cVery good,\u201d Professor Ferox was saying, \u201cNow, a bit closer and give him a stroke, go on.\u201d\nSwallowing hard, Remus obeyed, ready to jump back if he had to. But Achilles did not need to mind that he was a werewolf. Instead, he actually began to purr as Remus rubbed him tentatively behind the ear, closing its eyes and looking completely docile. \u201cThere we are!\u201d Professor Ferox cheered, delighted, \u201cExcellent judges of character, kneazles. Now, we haven\u2019t long left, so if you\u2019ll all just make a note of the homework\u2026\u201d\nRemus stroked Achilles for a little bit longer. The creature seemed to be enjoying it so much that he felt bad for stopping.\n\u201cThat was good, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Marlene chatted, as they left their first lesson, \u201cI hope he always brings things in for us to look at.\u201d\n\u201cNot going to be very practical when we get to the XXXXX creatures.\u201d Remus said.\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll bring Achilles in again, though,\u201d Marlene replied, hopefully.\n\u201cWho cares about his cat!\u201d Mary nudged her, \u201cHe\u2019s bloody gorgeous.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Marlene giggled, \u201cI wonder if he\u2019s single?\u201d\nRemus sighed, and began to lag behind the girls. They were a nightmare when they got onto the topic of boys, and it was best to stay out of their way before they started waxing lyrical about James and Sirius. He began to daydream as they meandered in the direction of the great hall for lunch.\nIt had been a better lesson than he\u2019d expected, and even though Ferox hadn\u2019t given him any house points, he had essentially said that Remus had a trustworthy character. No one had ever said anything like that before, and it made him feel unusually pleased with himself, a peaceful feeling that carried on through lunch, into their Potions lesson later that day, and was still going strong that night as he drifted off to sleep. He dreamed of lions."

            "content": "Wednesday 12\nth\nSeptember 1973\n\u201cUgh, go back to bed, Lupin!\u201d Sirius threw a shoe at him from his bed.\n\u201cSorry!\u201d Remus cringed, guiltily, as he quickly pulled the curtains shut, throwing the room back into darkness. It was 5AM, and he was\nawake\n. More awake than he\u2019d ever felt in his life.\nHe crept downstairs, not wanting to disturb anyone else, clutching a shoebox under one arm. With a brand new book to read, Remus set up camp in the most comfortable armchair in the deserted common room. He often came down early, on mornings like this, when his body simply refused to sleep and he had so much energy he thought he could run laps around the castle without breaking a sweat. Remus had never actually tried this \u2013 if anything, he tried to push the strange urge away, lock it up and focus on his mind instead.\nStill, he struggled to concentrate on his book. He thought about going for a walk, but they weren\u2019t really allowed out of bounds until breakfast began at six.\nUgh\n, he had to try not to think about breakfast, or his stomach would start growling. Never mind that he\u2019d had three helpings of mashed potato with his beef stew last night. Even Peter had looked impressed.\nEven if it\nwas\ntime for breakfast, he\u2019d said he would be in the common room for an hour from six thirty onwards. This was the ideal time, he had decided \u2013 no one expected you to be up to anything nefarious that early in the morning, and the other marauders typically didn\u2019t get up until seven thirty, even on weekdays. Sirius would stay in bed longer if he possibly could. James sometimes got up for an early morning broom practice, but not usually until after seven.\nRemus looked down at the shoebox in his lap. He could cast a quick misdirection charm if James came down sooner than expected, that wouldn\u2019t be too difficult. Mind you, the state his magic was in at the moment he\u2019d better not do it while the box was in his lap \u2013 or he ran the risk of vanishing something much more vital. He\u2019d already been to Madam Pomfrey once this term, attempting to grow his hair out in Transfiguration. He\u2019d needed Peter and James to help him carry his rapidly growing locks to the hospital wing \u2013 Sirius had been laughing too hard to be of any use at all.\nRemus experimented levitating his book, but it shot up to the ceiling, smacking it hard before plummeting towards the floor. He sighed. He could do nothing but sit still and wait, it seemed. He wished he could have the record player on \u2013 Sirius had left it in the common room along with his newest albums from Andromeda \u2013\nAladdin Sane\n, and\nLed Zeppelin IV\n. Sirius had been listening to \u2018Black Dog\u2019 on repeat for weeks now.\nRemus opened the shoe box and took a quick inventory, though it was unnecessary; this would be his first sale. If anyone came. He\u2019d spoken to a few fifth years he\u2019d seen smoking the year before, and got them interested. They seemed to be under some impression that \u2018muggle fags\u2019 were somehow more potent, or maybe just more exotic than wizarding ones. He did nothing to discourage the idea, and told them to spread the word.\nSirius had once obtained an exhaustive list of all the Hogwarts school rules, suggesting that they attempt to break every one before they reached seventh year. Remus read through it and had found nothing that mentioned tobacco trafficking. Not if you took the language very literally, anyway. Besides, it wasn\u2019t going to be a regular thing \u2013 he only had the stuff he\u2019d brought with him.\nHe had planned to give it all a bit more thought, to wait until after the full moon, but then he found out that their first Hogsmeade weekend was coming up on the 15\nth\nand he\u2019d decided he needed to get a move on.\nSirius and James had already planned the trip out in full, without consulting Peter or Remus, who were just happy to trail after them as usual. Honeyduke\u2019s, obviously, and Zonko\u2019s to stock up on dung bombs. Then the shrieking shack, because James\u2019s dad didn\u2019t believe it was haunted, which meant James didn\u2019t either, and Sirius wanted to prove them both wrong. Then they were very keen to have Remus try something called\nbutterbeer\n.\nRemus had his own plans. He was going to tell them that a long-lost aunt had died, and left him a very small amount of money. This would hopefully be enough of an explanation to satisfy James, who was certain to ask where Remus had acquired his newfound wealth. Remus felt sure that petty crime, even in the muggle world, was not something James took lightly. Sirius might shrug it off, having little regard for rules in any setting \u2013 but he would probably also try to lend Remus some of his own money, which defeated the whole point.\n\u201cLupin? That you?\u201d\nA sixth year had come down the stairs from the boy\u2019s dormitories, still looking bleary eyed, clutching a NEWT textbook.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus sat up straighter in the armchair, roused from his daydream.\n\u201cGreat, um\u2026 did you say five sickles for a pack of twenty?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Remus opened his box, quickly, gesturing the sixth year over.\nThey made the swap and the sixth year scurried out of the portrait hole, probably off for a morning fag before the library. The little silver coins rattled heavy in Remus\u2019s hand and he grinned to himself. He was selling everything for twice the market rate, but if people were willing to pay\u2026\nHe made two more sales to some fifth years, and to a seventh year girl who bought a packet of loose tobacco and asked if he had anything \u2018more fun\u2019 for sale. He was a bit confused by what she meant. And just repeated that he only had pre-rolled and loose. She shrugged,\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask Martha Ebhurst in Hufflepuff, she\u2019s usually got good stuff.\u201d\nRemus nodded, still not really sure what she meant. Either way, it appeared that he was not the only student in school with an entrepreneurial mind.\nBy quarter past seven, Remus\u2019s shoebox was half empty and his pockets jangling. Deeply satisfied, he packed everything away as the common room filled up with students beginning their days.\n\u201cWotcher Remu,\u201d James came bounding down the stairs, broom in hand, just as Remus was heading up them, \u201cYou\u2019re up early.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d Remus replied evasively. Fortunately, James was eager to get out to the quidditch pitch and didn\u2019t pay any attention to the shoebox, or the strange clinking sound Remus\u2019s robes were making.\n\u201cSee you for lunch?\u201d He called, already hallway across the room,\n\u201cYep.\u201d Remus nodded, hurrying on his way back upstairs.\nIn the dorm room, Peter was in the shower and Sirius was still asleep, covers thrown over his head, the only part of him visible was his black hair spilling out on the white pillow. Remus crept silently over to his bed and deposited his money and his goods, before collecting together his books for the day.\nJames had obviously yanked back the curtains before leaving, and \u2013 Remus thought with some annoyance \u2013 had not received the same rebuke from Sirius that he had. There was enough light for him to neatly sort through his homework and carefully stow it in his bag. He\u2019d done all the work that was due for the next few days, unsure how much time Madam Pomfrey would make him stay off lessons. He hoped not too long \u2013 he\u2019d asked James to make a note of the homework for their shared classes, but he\u2019d be missing Care of Magical Creatures and Runes too. He couldn\u2019t very well ask any of the girls to get the right notes for him, not without them asking where he\u2019d be.\nHis stomach rumbled again. He wondered if James was having breakfast right now. Potter often ate food on the go, always rushing off to one place or another. The bathroom door creaked open and Peter peered around the door, hair still wet and cheeks pink from the shower. He waved, and mouthed \u2018morning, Moony\u2019. Remus raised a hand in response.\nPeter looked at Sirius \u2013 who was still just a lump in the duvet \u2013 anxiously, before tiptoeing carefully over to his own bed to fetch his tie. Remus watched with some amusement as Peter attempted to gather his things without making so much as a sound. There was a fine line, Remus thought, between showing respect for your dorm mates sleeping habits, and just being a complete and utter wuss.\nIt was mean of him, but Remus was feeling particularly wicked, that morning. Blame it on the moon. He pulled his wand slowly from his pocket, and waved it very slightly, whispering under his breath.\nIn an instant, Peter\u2019s book bag slid off the end of his bed, landing with a heavy thud which reverberated off the bedroom\u2019s stone walls, rattling the window panes. Wide eyed, Peter froze, going pale. He shot a look at Sirius, who was stirring, and practically fled from the room, leaving his tie behind.\nRemus wheezed with laughter, having to sit down on his own bed, clutching his stomach. When he opened his eyes, still catching his breath, Sirius was wide awake, still lying in bed, propped up on one elbow, staring at Remus as if he was mad.\n\u201cYou did that on purpose, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nRemus shrugged and nodded, standing up again and returning to his pile of homework. Sirius threw a pillow at him.\n\u201cKnob.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Pete looked like such a prat tiptoeing around you, couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d\n\u201cNot very gallant of you, picking on the weak, Moony,\u201d Sirius yawned and stretched.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Remus waved a dismissive hand, \u201cI\u2019ll take him his tie. Anyway, someone had to get you up, c\u2019mon, it\u2019s breakfast.\u201d\nSirius yawned again.\n\u201cBring me something up.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cJames would,\u201d Sirius whined.\n\u201cJames isn\u2019t here.\u201d\n\u201c\nPeter\nwould.\u201d\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve established,\u201d Remus said, hoisting his book bag up onto his shoulder, \u201cPeter\u2019s a coward.\u201d\nSirius groaned and leaned back.\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll get up. Wait for me?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d Remus complained.\n\u201cI won\u2019t take long! Just treat is as penance for waking me up.\u201d\n\u201cYou threw a shoe at me, this morning.\u201d\n\u201cDid I hit you?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWell then.\u201d Sirius got out of bed, grabbing his uniform. \u201cServes you right anyway, getting up at stupid o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d Remus said, \u201cI think it\u2019s the moon.\u201d\nSirius stopped outside the bathroom door. He looked at Remus with something a bit like pity \u2013 if Sirius Black even had it in him to feel sorry for anyone but himself. Remus regretted saying anything \u2013 he didn\u2019t want pity, he rarely brought up the full moon for exactly that reason.\n\u201cSorry, Lupin.\u201d Sirius said, \u201cIs it\u2026 I mean, do you worry about it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that,\u201d Remus said, hurriedly, \u201cI just get restless. Hungry too, so hurry up.\u201d He laughed, lightly, to show that everything was fine. Sirius smirked, disappearing into the bathroom.\n\u201cYou ought to be grateful, Moony,\u201d he called from inside, turning on the shower, \u201cNot many Gryffindor\u2019s would be able to lie-in when they know they\u2019re sharing a room with a restless werewolf.\u201d\n\u201cWanker.\u201d Remus called back.\n* * *\nThursday 13\nth\nSeptember 1973\nHe woke up upstairs, which was unusual. There were mice in the house, he knew that because he often saw them before he transformed. Perhaps once he turned he chased them, but he didn\u2019t think he ever caught any. Three of his fingers were broken, but at least his shoulders hadn\u2019t dislocated \u2013 that had already happened twice this year.\nBefore moving, Remus made a series of mental checks from top to toe. What hurt? How\nmuch\ndid it hurt? Was he numb anywhere? Did all his limbs move when he wanted them too? No, it seemed all right. A few scratches, none too deep. He\u2019d got off easily. Perhaps the wolf was happy to be back at Hogwarts too.\nHe got up from the floor and limped over to the window. Sometimes his knees got a bit out of joint, but this morning they were only sore. He tried to squint through the gaps in the boards, but it was no good. The house was sealed up tight.\n\u201cRemus, dear?\u201d Madam Pomfrey\u2019s voice drifted up the stairs,\n\u201cComing,\u201d he croaked back, hoarsely. His clothes were downstairs, so he ripped an old blanket from the bed with his good hand and wrapped it around himself. It smelled of mildew and dead things.\n* * *\n\u201cWhat have I told you boys? He can\u2019t have visitors on the first day!\u201d Madam Pomfrey\u2019s scolding interrupted his dreams. Remus blinked, yawning. The hospital was dimly lit, curtains drawn. It must be evening already. His stomach grumbled. He wondered if he\u2019d eaten anything yet, or if the nurse had let him sleep instead. He lost so much time, after a transformation \u2013 like his bones, nothing seemed to fit together quite right.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been\nalmost\na day,\u201d Peter\u2019s voice now. \u201cWe brought him chocolate.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s very nice of you, dear,\u201d Madam Pomfrey\u2019s voice softened a little. She wasn\u2019t a natural disciplinarian. \u201cBut Mr Lupin is sleep\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d love some chocolate,\u201d he called out, hoping they could hear him. His throat felt raw.\nThe curtain whipped back to reveal Peter, James and Sirius standing there, looking triumphant.\n\u201cHiya, Moony!\u201d James and Sirius chorused, plonking themselves down at the end of the bed, either side of his ankles.\n\u201cHere you go,\u201d Peter dropped three chocolate frogs into his lap.\n\u201cCheers!\u201d\n\u201cWell if you\u2019re up anyway,\u201d Madam Pomfrey sighed, \u201cI\u2019ll go and fetch you some proper food. Half an hour, boys, that\u2019s\nall\n.\u201d\n\u201cHere\u2019s your homework, you big weirdo.\u201d James pulled some parchment from his bag, handing it over,\n\u201cThanks James, you\u2019re a lifesaver.\u201d Remus put it on his bedside table for later.\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s the rest of it,\u201d Sirius handed him some more. \u201cI had to wait outside your Care of Magical Creatures class for half of lunch, so you\u2019d better get top marks on that.\u201d\n\u201cYou did?!\u201d Remus stared at Sirius, amazed. Sirius nodded, imperiously,\n\u201cI did. Got to say, too, bit jealous of you. Looks like a really interesting subject, wish I wasn\u2019t stuck doing Divination.\u201d\n\u201cBut what about\nme\n?!\u201d James said, gasping dramatically.\n\u201cI see plenty of you.\u201d Sirius retorted, giving him a shove.\n\u201cSuch a fickle heart.\u201d James sighed, making large eyes at Sirius, so that Peter began to giggle uncontrollably. Sirius shoved James again, and James leapt at him, pulling him into a headlock and tussling Sirius\u2019s hair.\n\u201cOi, Moony,\u201d Peter said, suddenly, \u201cArbella Fenchurch gave me this for you,\u201d he set down a handful of sickles. \u201cShe said you knew what it was for?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 yeah, cheers Pete.\u201d Remus hurriedly tried to gather up the coins and hide them under his pillow. \u201cI um\u2026 I had this chocolate frog card she really wanted. Aglaonike of Thessaly.\u201d\n\u201cOh I wanted that one!\u201d Peter looked hurt. Remus shrugged,\n\u201cSorry mate. Money talks.\u201d"

            "content": "Saturday 15\nth\nSeptember 1972\n\u201cPack your cloak, James.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou never know, do you?\u201d\n\u201cFine, but I doubt we\u2019ll want it.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget you owe me a galleon on that bet we had.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d James returned, patiently, \u201cJust relax for a minute, will you?\u201d\n\u201cNever.\u201d Sirius grinned back, \u201cYou do realise that this is the most excitement I\u2019ve had in months? I wasn\u2019t even allowed to go to Diagon Alley this summer.\u201d\n\u201cYou had more going on than I did,\u201d James replied, resentfully, \u201cYou at least had all that betrothal drama. My family\u2019s so boring.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Potter, your family\u2019s amazing and you know it. I definitely had the worst summer.\u201d\n\u201cI had a great time in France.\u201d Peter piped up, but no one paid him much attention.\n\u201cWhat about you, Moony?\u201d James asked, as they wended their way down the stairs into the common room. A gang of excited third years was waiting, ready for their first trip to the village. They were watched over with a fond sort of nostalgia by the older students.\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Remus asked, pushing away flashbacks to the summer, the memory of wriggling through a tiny bathroom window and landing hard on his knees on the tile below.\n\u201cHow was your summer? You haven\u2019t told us anything.\u201d\n\u201cNothing to tell.\u201d Remus said. \u201cMore boring than both of yours \u2013 no magic. I just read.\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019re all coming to mine for Christmas.\u201d James said, cheerfully. They began to file out of the common room and head towards the front entrance. \u201cSame as last year, yeah? Moon\u2019s on the tenth of December, so we don\u2019t even have to worry about that.\u201d\nRemus gaped,\n\u201cHow do you know when it is?\u201d He hadn\u2019t even looked that far ahead yet.\n\u201cTold you, we were bored other the summer,\u201d Sirius elbowed him, \u201cWe looked it up, for the next few years.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 why?!\u201d Remus was torn between feeling very touched, and somewhat violated. It wasn\u2019t for\nthem\nto worry about. It was his own private problem, and always had been.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like quidditch.\u201d James said \u2013 whenever anything was important to him he compared it to quidditch -- \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know your team\u2019s weaknesses in order to work to their strengths.\u201d\n\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Remus replied, glumly, not wanting to talk about it much more. He had hoped that once they knew about his condition there would be no more researching it behind his back. That they could all just get on with things in the way he preferred \u2013 which was to ignore the problem completely.\nThe trouble was, nothing was private when it came to James and Sirius \u2013 your whole life was up for grabs. Remus still wasn\u2019t used to this \u2013 as hard as he tried to keep up, there were just some things he would never want to share. It was all very well if you were James, and had open parents who talked to you and listened to you in return. Or Sirius, who was so outgoing and almost entirely shameless.\n\u201cLook who it is,\u201d Sirius nudged James, pointing at a dark figure waiting in the archway entrance. Lily pushed past the marauders and went to meet him. Snape.\n\u201cWhy are they even friends?!\u201d James ran his hands through his hair distractedly.\n\u201cThey grew up in the same town,\u201d Remus said, as they carried on, watching the couple ahead, talking animatedly; one red head, one black.\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d James rounded on him, looking affronted.\n\u201cShe told me.\u201d\n\u201cYou fancy her, then?\u201d James asked, clearly struggling to know how to react. Remus rolled his eyes,\n\u201c\nNo\n. We just chat.\u201d he said, firmly. \u201cAnd if\nyou\nfancy her, then you might want to try it.\u201d\nHe\u2019d noticed this sort of talk creeping into their conversations lately. Sometimes he had to double check he was talking to the marauders and not Marlene and Mary \u2013\n\u2018he fancies her\u2019, \u2018she fancies so-and-so,\u2019\n\u2013 and on and on. To make matters worse, Avni Chaudhry, a Gryffindor third year, was now going out with Ravenclaw fourth year Matthew Studt, and no one had talked about anything else for days; everyone seemed to have an opinion on it. It was mind numbingly boring stuff to Remus, for whom (aside from a few exceptions) girls were still generally incomprehensible.\n\u201cShe likes you, though.\u201d James said. \u201cYou did all your revision together last term.\u201d\n\u201cOnly because you lot couldn\u2019t be arsed,\u201d Remus replied defensively. They were approaching the town now, a cluster of pretty stone buildings sat just below them. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like we were alone, Mary and Marlene were there too.\u201d\n\u201cWe all need to take notes from Moony,\u201d Sirius teased, \u201cBirds follow him everywhere. How\u2019d you do it, Lupin? Those big brown eyes of yours?\u201d\nJames and Peter snickered, but Remus ignored him, walking a little bit ahead, hands in his pockets, still limping slightly from his last transformation. \u00a0That was an utterly ridiculous suggestion, especially when it was obvious to anyone with eyes that Sirius was the best-looking boy in the year.\nIt was clearer than ever, now that they were all getting taller, growing from childhood into adolescence. James had a certain amount of swagger; that came with wealth and skill on the quidditch pitch, but Sirius was always going to be in another league entirely. Remus hadn\u2019t decided whether to be jealous about it or not, and tried not to think about it too much.\nWhen they finally reached Hogsmeade, Remus could not be more relieved. The village looked like the sort of place Remus had previously thought only existed in children\u2019s books. The cobbled streets gleamed in the yellow mid-September sunshine, and the\u00a0higgledy-piggledy rows of black beamed Tudor cottages might as well have been made of gingerbread and spun sugar.\n\u201cHoneyduke\u2019s?\u201d James said.\n\u201cHoneyduke\u2019s.\u201d The others responded, in unison.\nRemus had never entered the sweet shop through the front door before, nor had he ever been on the shop floor. It was packed to the rafters with boxes, jars and bags of every kind of confection imaginable. Great trees of brightly coloured lollipops, as large as pinwheels, slabs of chocolate the size of paving stones; piles and piles of glittering sugar mice.\nThe shop was also packed with Hogwarts students, and the marauders had to push and squeeze to even get close to the goods. They filled their basket with enough sweets to last them until Christmas, at least, before queuing for the till, manned by a very harassed looking wizard with white hair. Remus realised that this was probably Mr Honeyduke, and wondered whether the shopkeeper knew there was a secret tunnel in his cellar.\nAfter that, their next stop was Zonko\u2019s, the joke shop, which was just as busy as Honeyduke\u2019s, and one of the noisiest places Remus had ever been. Every few seconds something seemed to explode, pop, or start whistling somewhere in the shop, accompanied by the delighted laughter or horrified shrieks of students. James and Sirius were clearly old hands at practical joke shopping, and made an efficient sweep of the premises, weighing up the benefits and downsides of each contraption like a pair of bankers at the stock exchange. Half an hour later and they were finally leaving, weighted down with bags full of dungbombs, trick wands, exploding inkwells, hiccup sweets and bars of frog spawn soap.\nRemus thought they had perhaps been a little short-sighted doing all their shopping first, because next James and Sirius wanted to visit the Shrieking Shack, which meant leaving the main high street and facing an uphill climb, goods in tow.\n\u201cSo, what is this place, again?\u201d Remus huffed as he struggled up the hill, his knee and hip still bothering him.\n\u201cHaunted house,\u201d James replied, taking two of Remus\u2019s heaviest shopping bags from him without a word. \u201cMost haunted place in Britain, dad says.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not haunted!\u201d Sirius called from up ahead, \u201cYou Potters are just superstitious.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that the ghosts there are really nasty,\u201d Peter said, anxiously, struggling almost as much as Remus was with the steep incline. \u201cWorse than Peeves.\u201d\n\u201cAre they poltergeists, then?\u201d Remus asked, curious \u2013 he\u2019d been planning to do some reading about spirituous apparitions when he got the chance, after learning that it had been his father\u2019s main area of study.\n\u201cThink so,\u201d James said, \u201cThe locals say they hear screaming coming from the house some nights.\u201d\n\u201cOnly for a few years, though,\u201d Sirius countered, \u201cPoltergeists don\u2019t just move in at a moment\u2019s notice. There would have to be decades and decades of disturbance and negative energy building up to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh my god.\u201d\nLupin stopped still and almost dropped the bags he was still holding. He had looked up at the house for the first time, and a cold chill struck the pit of his stomach.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up Moony? Want me to take your other bags?\u201d James was asking.\nRemus shook his head, speechless, he couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away. He\u2019d never seen it from the outside before; they always came through the tunnel. But he knew the shade of the wood, he knew what the boarded windows looked like.\n\u201cBloody hell, if it is haunted, then I think Moony\u2019s been possessed.\u201d Sirius said, sounding like he was only half-joking. \u201cOi, Lupin. You\u2019re being weird, stop it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d Remus struggled to find the words. He closed his eyes and tried to take a few breaths. \u201cThat\u2019s the house. Where they put me.\u201d\nJames seemed to understand at once, and put a hand on Remus\u2019s shoulder in a brotherly sort of way.\n\u201cOk, c\u2019mon, it\u2019s time to go.\u201d He said.\nNo one said anything as they began to trudge back downhill, towards the town. Remus looked at the ground ahead the whole time, concentrating on putting one foot in front of the other and getting as far away from the shack as he could.\nThe Shrieking Shack\n. Shrieking. He felt sick. James steered them in the direction of a quaint looking pub. Inside there were lots of tables and comfortable chairs, not a far cry from the Gryffindor common room. They found seats in a quiet corner, and Remus sat, gratefully, his joints very sore now. James went to the bar, and Sirius and Peter sat quietly either side of Remus.\n\u201cSo\u2026 on the full moon, that\u2019s where you go?\u201d Peter asked. Remus nodded, fiddling with a damp beer mat on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s not haunted, then?\u201d Peter continued.\n\u201cNope. Just me.\u201d\n\u201cSo, wait, the shrieking is\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMe.\u201d\n\u201cBut why\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Pettigrew.\u201d Sirius snarled, suddenly. Remus looked at him, taken aback.\nJames returned with four bottles of amber liquid and set them down, taking his own seat.\n\u201cButterbeer!\u201d He said, brightly, pushing one towards Remus, \u201cTry it, Moony, you\u2019ll love it.\u201d\nRemus raised the glass to his lips. He was still feeling a bit queasy, and the concoction in the bottle smelled very syrupy \u2013 but he found that sweet things usually helped if he\u2019d had a shock. He took a sip, and felt instantly warmed by the delicious liquid. He smiled at James, hoping they wouldn\u2019t ask any more questions.\nThey didn\u2019t. Instead they spent a very pleasant afternoon drinking butterbeer and planning how best to utilise their new practical joke arsenal. Peter had the unusually brilliant idea of casting a remote timer spell on the dungbombs, so that they could be triggered at anytime from anywhere in the castle.\n\u201cExcellent diversionary tactic,\u201d James exclaimed, excited, \u201cThink of what we could get away with if Filch was chasing dung bombs on the opposite side of the building!\u201d\n\u201cGive us time to work on the map a bit more, too.\u201d Remus added.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not seeing the big picture.\u201d Sirius folded his arms, leaning back on his chair. \u201cWe could set them all to go off at the same time. Imagine! We\u2019ve probably got enough here to hide one in every classroom \u2013 total chaos!\u201d Sirius looked so enraptured when he said this, that the other three were completely taken in, nodding furiously.\n\u201cOh, let\u2019s not sit here, Lily, it doesn\u2019t look very clean.\u201d A nasty, bitter voice interrupted them, \u201cThey allow in all sorts, clearly.\u201d\nSirius snapped forward on his chair, glaring at Snape, who was hovering next to a nearby table.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Sev, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Lily shook her head, pulling out a seat.\n\u201cAlright, Evans?\u201d James waved at her, compulsively, getting that stupid look on his face.\n\u201cLeave us alone, will you, Potter?\u201d Lily tossed her hair, \u201cHiya, Remus.\u201d\n\u201cHi,\u201d he waved at her, grinning. He couldn\u2019t help enjoying the way she treated the marauders, she was the only one who didn\u2019t fawn over them.\n\u201cEurgh,\u201d Sirius said, holding his nose, looking at Snape, \u201cWhat is that\nsmell\n? Potter, did you trail something in on your shoe?\u201d\nJames sniggered,\n\u201cSmells more like a dung bomb\u2019s gone off.\u201d\n\u201cDisgusting,\u201d Sirius smirked, \u201cMaybe we should open a window.\u201d\nSnape had gone white with rage. Lily put a hand on his arm,\n\u201cJust ignore them, Sev, they\u2019re idiots.\u201d\nBut Severus would not let Sirius have the last word.\n\u201cHow\u2019s the family, Black?\u201d He asked, his voice wheedling, insidious. Sirius\u2019s mouth formed a hard line. Snape continued, \u201cRegulus was telling everyone you had quite an exciting summer.\nSo\nexciting, in fact, that you\u2019re no longer welcome back, hm?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, Snivellus.\u201d Sirius spat. Remus knew that it was too late now \u2013 Sirius had engaged, and there would be no going back.\n\u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d Snape raised an eyebrow, clearly thrilled at the reaction he had elicited. \u201cHad any post from mummy this year, Black? Heard\nanything at all\nfrom\nany\nof your relatives?\u201d\nSirius had a very odd look on his face. Remus had the impression that he was realising something for the first time, and trying not to let Severus see it. James looked concerned, no longer laughing.\n\u201cIgnore him, mate,\u201d he said, quietly, \u201cHe\u2019s a prick, ignore him.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m right, then,\u201d Severus\u2019s thin lips curved into a nasty smile, \u201cNo wonder you follow Potter around like a lovesick girl, when your own family don\u2019t want anything to do with you. When you\u2019ve been disowned like that, I suppose all that\u2019s left is to associate with the dregs of society\u2026\u201d He cast his black-eyed gaze over Peter and Remus.\nSirius stood up, knocking his chair back. His wand was in his hand; he must have reached for it while Snape was talking. Remus stood too, his aching bones forgotten as he clenched his fists, ready to beat Severus senseless, if Sirius gave the word.\n\u201cSirius, don\u2019t!\u201d James went to snatch his wand away \u2013 they weren\u2019t allowed to perform magic in Hogsmeade.\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Severus, let\u2019s go,\u201d Lily had stood up too and was tugging her friend\u2019s sleeve. She looked furious with him, which was a small comfort to Remus.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sirius said, his voice unnervingly steady and authoritative. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving. C\u2019mon, lads, I can\u2019t take this stench much longer.\u201d\nThey did as ordered, even James, who only threw one longing look back at Lily on their way out.\n\u201cThat was\u2026 really mature,\u201d Potter said, scratching his head as they stepped out of the pub into the warm evening light. Sirius snorted, starting off back to Hogwarts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not over.\u201d He said, fiercely, the others jogging to catch up with his purposeful strides. \u201cI\u2019ll show him. I\u2019ll bloody destroy him!\u201d\nThe marauders were at war."

Sirius had not joined them for dinner, and had been locked in the bathroom now for two hours, without making a sound.\n\u201cLeave him alone,\u201d Remus said, turning the page of his book. He lay belly down on his own bed, pretending he wasn\u2019t at all concerned. \u201cHe\u2019ll come out when he\u2019s ready.\u201d\nThat was something he\u2019d often heard Matron say. At least once a week, one of the St Edmund\u2019s boys \u2013 usually a new kid \u2013 had a tantrum and locked himself in a room, or crawled into some small space so no one could reach him. The response from staff was always the same; ignore it until he realises no one cares; until he realises that nothing he can do will make a difference. It always worked, Remus knew this first hand.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like him,\u201d James said, obviously disregarding Remus\u2019s draconian tactic. \u201cI could kill Snape, y\u2019know. For saying that stuff.\u201d\nRemus shrugged,\n\u201cBlack already hates his family, though. I dunno why he lets Snivellus bother him about it.\u201d\nJames stared at Remus, dumbfounded, as if he had just said something unimaginably cruel.\n\u201cThey\u2019re still his\nfamily\n, Moony.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re horrible to him.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t care what they think.\u201d James sighed. \u201cLook, Lupin, maybe you\u2019d better go before he comes out. Go and find Pete in the library or something.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Sirius\u2019s friend too!\u201d Remus sat up, indignantly.\n\u201cYeah, yeah, of course you are,\u201d James waved a hand, \u201cBut well\u2026 if he\u2019s been crying, I think he\u2019d rather no one else saw.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if he\u2019s crying. I want to help.\u201d\nThis was a bit of a lie. Remus had always felt uncomfortable around crying people \u2013 he never knew what to do with himself. But he really did want to help, too. Hadn\u2019t he\nalways\ntried to help?\nMore than ever Remus wanted to come clean about having prompted Narcissa into the unbreakable vow, just to see James\u2019s face. But he calmed himself. It wasn\u2019t a competition, and even if it was, it wasn\u2019t one he would win.\n\u201cOk,\u201d James said, \u201cbut you have to be understanding about it. You can\u2019t start a fight.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Remus was mortally offended. He never started fights.\n\u201cYou two! You\u2019re always bickering, I swear.\u201d\n\u201cWe do\nnot\nbicker.\u201d Remus snapped. James just raised his eyebrows, which was infuriating.\nThe dark-haired boy hopped off the bed once more and went back to the bathroom door.\n\u201cSirius?\u201d He knocked, \u201cPlease come out and talk to us?\u201d\n\u201cGet lost, Potter, leave me alone.\u201d\nJames sighed again. Remus, annoyed with James now just as much as he was annoyed with Sirius, got up too, and strode over to the door. Indicating for James to move, he rapped hard on the wood himself.\n\u201cI said piss o\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSirius, it\u2019s me.\u201d Remus said, his voice hard and cold, like Matron\u2019s. \u201cLook, if you\u2019re going to mope about like a big jessie then at least let us in so we can start planning our revenge?\u201d\nSilence.\nRemus tutted, \u201cFine, sulk. But you\u2019re being a selfish git. You know, you\u2019re not the only one whose family hates you.\u201d\n\u201c\nRe\nmus!\u201d James exclaimed, scandalised. Remus shrugged. It was worth a try.\nThere was a shuffling noise inside the bathroom. Remus pressed his ear to the door, then reeled back as it opened. Sirius\u2019s gloomy face peered out.\n\u201cFinally,\u201d James said, relieved, \u201cLook, come out and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMoony can come in.\u201d Sirius said, opening the door just wide enough for Remus to squeeze inside, then slamming it back and fixing the lock.\nIt was dark inside.\n\u201c\nLumos\n,\u201d Remus muttered. His wand point lit up, casting a pale glow over the small white room, and Sirius\u2019s pale face. He had been crying, his eyes were dark and red. Remus looked away quickly, glancing up at the light fittings. The bulbs were smashed. He tutted, \u201cYou and your temper, eh?\u201d He said, \u201c\nReparo\n.\u201d\nThe lights mended and flickered back on. Remus extinguished his wand light.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t do it on purpose,\u201d Sirius sniffed, wiping his nose with the back of his hand. It was a sullen, childish gesture, somehow inappropriate for Sirius who was, even at thirteen, usually the epitome of grace and poise. \u201cI still smash stuff sometimes, when I\u2019m angry. My magic gets out of whack.\u201d\n\u201cOh right,\u201d Remus nodded, though he\u2019d never heard of that before.\n\u201cSo, revenge?\u201d Sirius asked, sitting down on the toilet lid and looking at Remus expectantly.\n\u201cRevenge.\u201d Remus agreed, \u201cWhat\u2019d you want to do to him?\u201d\n\u201cNot just him.\u201d Sirius glowered, \u201cAll of them. Every single Slytherin in the school.\u201d\nRemus nodded enthusiastically \u2013 that sounded a bit bonkers, but it was a start. There would be time to talk him down later, when he was acting less weird and wasn\u2019t in danger of blowing up any more lightbulbs.\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll get \u2018em all, Black. Now c\u2019mon, let\u2019s go and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not coming out yet.\u201d Sirius said, sulkily, crossing his arms. Remus sighed. He sat on the floor, leaning against the door.\n\u201cOk, fine. Want to talk about it? Because James is probably the best person to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDid you mean what you just said?\u201d Sirius interrupted him again, \u201cDo you think my family hates me?\u201d\n\u201cOh god,\nI\ndunno, do I? I\u2019m not exactly an authority on families.\u201d Remus rubbed the back of his head. \u201cI was just trying to get you to open the door, to be honest.\u201d\nHe\u2019d meant it as a joke, but Sirius didn\u2019t smile. He looked down at Remus through a curtain of dark hair.\n\u201cYou said your family hates you.\u201d\n\u201cWell I s\u2019pose they must have,\u201d Remus explained. \u201cOtherwise they wouldn\u2019t\u2026 well, I wouldn\u2019t have been sent to St Edmund\u2019s, would I?\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean they hated you.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus reflected, \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they can have liked me very much, all the same.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not\u2026 I mean, it doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d\nRemus shrugged,\n\u201cSometimes, obviously. But, y\u2019know. No one\u2019s entitled to a happy life.\u201d Matron had said that many times. For the first time, saying it out loud, Remus wondered if she was entirely right.\n\u201cBlimey, Lupin, you\u2019re a right downer, you know that?\u201d\n\u201cYou let me in.\u201d Remus kicked Sirius lightly in the shin with the toe of his trainer. \u201cIf you want cheering up then I\u2019ll get Potter.\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d Sirius shrugged, smiling weakly. \u201cYou\u2019re ok.\u201d\nRemus laughed,\n\u201cJames didn\u2019t want me to come in. Said we just bicker.\u201d\n\u201cHe what?!\u201d Sirius shook his head. \u201cWe do\nnot\nbicker.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said.\u201d Remus assured him.\n\u201cMy family\u2026\u201d Sirius said, suddenly, \u201cI don\u2019t think they hate me. I think they want to like me, really. But I keep letting everyone down. It\u2019s funny most of the time, but\u2026 well, it isn\u2019t today.\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t know what to say to that, so he kept quiet. He thought about Narcissa, vowing to face death if she could not marry Lucius. He thought about Regulus, who often stared at his older brother across the dining hall, green eyed with jealousy. Families were a messy business. Perhaps he ought to be grateful to Lyall Lupin for ending it all in one fell swoop, so that Remus never had to know whether or not he would have made his father proud, or whether he would have been a disappointment after all.\n* * *\nFriday 5\nth\nOctober 1973\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it. I\u2019ve really got it this time.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice, Pete.\u201d Remus replied blithely, reading his Arithmancy textbook.\n\u201cWe should dye his robes pink.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019d just dye them back, it\u2019s too simple. Where would we even get his robes from?\u201d Remus turned the page and resumed his reading.\n\u201cOuch! Bloody hell, there\u2019s something wrong with that bludger!\u201d Sirius shouted, standing up. \u201cCome on, McKinnon, move your bloomin\u2019 arse!\u201d\n\u201cDo you mind leaving her arse out of it?\u201d Mary snapped, from a few rows up.\nThey were watching the Gryffindor quidditch practice. Well, Sirius, Peter and Mary were. Remus had just wanted to get on with his reading.\n\u201cJealous, MacDonald?\u201d Sirius replied, cheekily.\n\u201cDye his hair pink, then,\u201d Peter persisted, shaking Remus\u2019s arm for attention, \u201cI\u2019ve learnt colour changing spells now, I can do it.\u201d\n\u201cSo can he.\u201d Remus said, jerking his arm back and searching for his place on the page.\n\u201cYou know, Moony, you could show a\nbit\nmore interest.\u201d Sirius said.\n\u201cIn quidditch? Or taking down your arch nemesis?\u201d\n\u201cBoth. Either.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here, aren\u2019t I?\u201d Remus turned another page.\n\u201cWho\u2019s your arch nemesis?\u201d Mary asked, getting up and coming down to sit beside Sirius.\n\u201cIf I told you, I\u2019d have to kill you.\u201d Sirius said, dryly. Mary rolled her eyes,\n\u201cIs it Snape?\u201d\nAll three boys looked at Mary in surprise. She laughed, \u201cCome on, you lot, it\u2019s not exactly a secret \u2013 you\u2019ve all had it in for each other since first year. Plus, Lily is one of my best friends.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about Evans.\u201d Sirius groaned, \u201cI hear enough as it is.\u201d\n\u201cI think she\u2019s an idiot, going around with that creep.\u201d Mary said, rubbing her arms as if just the thought of Severus made her skin crawl. \u201cYou know he made Marlene cry the other day? Called her dad something really nasty. Makes no sense, either, because Lily says\nhe\u2019s\nhalf-blood, Severus\u2026 anyway, someone needs to teach him a lesson.\u201d\n\u201cHa!\u201d Sirius barked, \u201cHe\u2019s half-blood?! Brilliant.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Mary said, coolly. \u201cSo\u2019s Remus. And I\u2019m muggle born. So what?\u201d\nRemus finally looked up from his book to smirk at Sirius, raising an eyebrow at him. Sirius looked down, then back at the quidditch.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he muttered, \u201cI\u2019m not like that.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d Mary said, primly. \u201cI get enough of that shit from Slytherins.\u201d\nRemus was inclined to agree with Mary, who had more backbone than he did, putting Sirius in his place like that. Insults from the Slytherins had definitely increased this term, though it might only have been noticeable to non-pure blood students. Remus had started to worry about travelling between classes by himself, though he rarely had to. He\u2019d had a few near misses anyway, and been called a mudblood twice. He didn\u2019t tell James or Sirius this, it seemed a bit like whinging. Plus, as far as insults went, he felt like he\u2019d been called worse than \u2018mudblood\u2019.\nHe didn\u2019t like the idea that it had made Marlene cry, though. It was all very well that Remus got picked on by Snape and Mulciber, or even puny, sadistic little Barty Crouch, but making girls cry was another thing altogether. Remus felt a surge of protectiveness and chivalry towards his friend. He clenched his fists, then unclenched them.\nThe problem was that Snape wasn\u2019t the type to attack with hexes and big pranks. He could do both of those things, he was every bit as able as the marauders. But Snape relied on words to hurt people \u2013 and they were much trickier to counteract.\n\nUnless you changed the words.\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Remus put his book down, suddenly. He grabbed Sirius\u2019s arm, \u201cOh!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sirius frowned at him. He\u2019d been absorbed in watching the training while Remus\u2019s mind had wandered. There had been another opportunity for Sirius to join the quidditch team this year, but he had declined. Maybe because he had changed his mind. Maybe because he didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed in try outs again.\n\u201cWe change the words!\u201d Remus gabbled, \u201cWe\nchange what he says\n.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you on about?\u201d Sirius clucked his tongue. \u201cSnivellus?\u201d\n\u201cYeah! There are spells you can do to stop someone speaking, right?\u201d\nSirius coloured slightly, looking at Remus.\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d he said, cautiously.\n\u201cOk, so how much more difficult can it be to\u2026 to like, twist their words? We could set a trigger word \u2013 or a few \u2013\nmudblood\n, or\nblood-traitor\n, or\nhalf-breed\n,\ndunglicker\n, or\u2026 whatever.\u00a0 And instead, we make him say something really nice. Or something stupid. Whatever we feel like.\u201d\n\u201cMoony, where did you hear all of those\u2014\u201d\nJames scored a goal, and Peter leapt up, clapping wildly. Potter did a few loops on his broom, showing off. Sirius grinned up at his friend. Mary\u2019s knee was touching Sirius\u2019s, Remus noticed. They were sitting really close, actually.\n\u201cSo?\u201d Remus grabbed Sirius\u2019s shoulder again, trying to get him to focus. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\u201cI love it.\u201d Sirius said, simply. \u201cWe should make him say something really ridiculous, like\u2026 I dunno, \u2018snuggle bunnies\u2019 or something. We\u2019ll go to the library after this, yeah?\u201d\n\u201cCan I come?\u201d Mary asked. Sirius shrugged,\n\u201cIf you want, I s\u2019pose. It\u2019s serious marauder business though.\u201d\nMary giggled. Remus wondered if Sirius found that as annoying as he did. He picked up his book and returned to Arithmancy.\nTwenty minutes later, the training session was over and the marauders were walking towards the castle, Mary and Marlene in tow, Sirius and Remus both babbling excitedly to James about their brilliant plan (it had somehow become \u2018their\u2019 plan, in Sirius\u2019s mind).\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be off the pitch by five o\u2019clock.\u201d Someone grunted, in front of them.\nRemus looked up to see the Slytherin quidditch team walking towards them, brooms in hand, kits slung over their shoulders.\n\u201cWe\u2019re leaving now, Bulstrode, bloody hell.\u201d James said, annoyed.\nThe pug-faced Slytherin captain just scowled at him and pushed past, deliberately knocking James with his shoulder as he did so.\n\u201cOi!\u201d Sirius pulled out his wand. James held him back.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you, Black?\u201d Bulstrode sneered, \u201cIf that\u2019s still even your\nname\n.\u201d The Slytherins all laughed. Including their smallest, newest member, who had been behind the others.\nRegulus Black.\nIt took James and Remus to pull Sirius away, as the Slytherins snickered and whispered.\n\u201cRemember the plan,\u201d Remus whispered. Sirius slackened, then nodded.\n\u201cPromise me we\u2019ll get\nall\nof them.\u201d He growled."

Garrulous?\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Remus smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll work on figuring out which spell we\u2019ll need, and James, you can figure out how we actually manage to cast it on the whole house\u2026 that\u2019s going to be really hard, I think \u2013 Peter, you better help with that.\u201d\n\u201cHark at Moony!\u201d James laughed, buttering his toast, \u201cGiving the orders now.\u201d\n\u201cThe marauders are a socialist utopia,\u201d Sirius yawned again, \u201cWe don\u2019t have leaders.\u201d\n\u201cEnjoying Muggle Studies, are you?\u201d Remus raised an eyebrow. Sirius lay his head on the dining table, closing his eyes and flipping two fingers at Remus.\nAn owl landed on the breakfast table \u2013 it was James\u2019s. Sirius\u2019s owl had been confiscated by his parents so many times that he may as well not have one at all, Peter typically relied on the school owls, and Remus never received post anyway.\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d James opened the letter proffered by the bird with a frown. \u201cThe\u2026 slug club?!\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Sirius opened a sleepy eye, \u201cI got one too. Apparently ol\u2019 sluggy likes students who have a certain star quality. So, me, obviously. And I s\u2019pose you too.\u201d\nNeither Peter nor Remus received an invitation; but this was not much of a surprise. Peter was quite good at Potions, but lacked aptitude for almost anything else. As for Remus, he tried to fly under the radar where Professor Slughorn was concerned.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t go then.\u201d James said, folding up his letter decisively. \u201cAll for one and one for all, us marauders.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Remus shrugged, \u201cGo if you want to. I bet Lily\u2019s going.\u201d\n\u201cDo you!? Yeah, she is really good at Potions, isn\u2019t she?\u201d James said, getting that funny look on his face again, \u201cShe\u2019s really good at everything, probably the cleverest in the year\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOi!\u201d Remus and Sirius said, in unison. James raised an eyebrow,\n\u201cCleverest\ngirl\n, then.\u201d\nSirius closed his eyes once more, satisfied, and attempted to doze through the rest of breakfast.\n* * *\nThursday 11\nth\nOctober 1973\nThe party was held later that week. James, still uneasy about the exclusion of the two lesser marauders, tried to convince Peter and Remus to don the invisibility cloak and come anyway. Sirius thought this sounded like a good laugh, but Remus personally thought it beneath him. He had no desire to be among the chosen few. In the end, Peter declined too, though he had clearly been on the cusp of agreeing to the ridiculous scheme.\nAnyway, Thursdays were Remus\u2019s favourite day of the school week. Specifically, Thursdays from 2pm to 4pm \u2013 that slot in his timetable allotted to Care of Magical Creatures. Their Wednesday lessons were always theory based, and Remus liked those too; he\u2019d never heard anyone talk about biology like Professor Ferox. But Thursdays were given over to practical lessons, and the class would walk out onto the grounds, or else arrive at the classroom to find a new creature waiting for them, Ferox bright with excitement to show them.\nAfter kneazles, they\u2019d seen doxies and crups. This week was murtlaps. Mary and Marlene squealed at the creatures Ferox presented in a large hutch-like run at the back of the classroom. Remus couldn\u2019t blame them \u2013 murtlaps were extremely unappealing. They were rat-like creatures, with masses of writhing tentacles sprouting from their backs like maggots.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do crups and kneazles every week,\u201d Ferox grinned, gesturing for them all to gather around, \u201cNot all of the magical creatures we learn about will be cute. But diversity is the spice of life, hm?\u201d\n\u201cI hope we don\u2019t have to touch them,\u201d Marlene whispered, shuddering.\nRemus didn\u2019t mind \u2013 they were gross, but he didn\u2019t mind gross things. He had a pretty strong stomach; Professor Ferox had already told him so, last week when they were watching the doxy eggs hatch. Remus had beamed with pride all day long.\nFerox was looking at Remus now,\n\u201cMr Lupin, I\u2019m sure I can rely on you to tell me the beneficial properties of murtlap tentacles?\u201d\nRemus tried not to smile too broadly, or look too much like a goody goody.\n\u201cThey\u2019re really good for soothing superficial cuts and abrasions,\u201d he said, promptly, \u201cAnd if you eat them, they make you impervious to most common hexes.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent, five points to Gryffindor.\u201d\nRemus couldn\u2019t help smiling a bit. Who cared about the stupid slug club. Slughorn was nowhere near as cool as Ferox; Ferox was clever and unpretentious and funny, and did dangerous things. Remus had never given much thought to having a career, but for some weeks now he had been entertaining the idea that whatever he did when he grew up, he would like to be just like Professor Ferox.\nMind you, he\u2019d have to start eating more, or weight training or something, because if Ferox was anything, he was broad. And Remus, though he was inches above the other marauders now in height, remained eternally weedy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s your metabolism.\u201d Madam Pomfrey told him, when he\u2019d asked one morning after a moon. \u201cYou could eat more, or rest more, but it may just be one of those things, I\u2019m afraid. I shouldn\u2019t worry, dear, you\u2019re as healthy as can be expected.\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t sound all that reassuring, but he accepted it. His father had been thin too, he was sure. At least he wasn\u2019t pudgy, like Peter, who still looked like a little boy compared to the rest of them.\nThis fact was made even clearer later that evening, when Sirius and James stood fully dressed in their formal robes, looking every inch the young lords of the manor, and Peter sat staring at them enviously from his bed, already in his pyjamas.\n\u201cD\u2019you think there\u2019ll be dancing?\u201d Sirius asked, anxiously, straightening his tie,\n\u201cNah,\u201d James replied, desperately trying to comb his hair flat, \u201cWe\u2019d have been told to bring partners or something.\u201d\nSirius slumped on the bed,\n\u201cI hate stuff like this. Moony, you go for me, bet ol\u2019 Sluggy won\u2019t even notice.\u201d\n\u201cFat chance,\u201d Remus snorted from behind his copy of\nVerbal Assault: Defensive Tongue Twisters.\n\u201cSlughorn can\u2019t even remember my name half the time. And he\u2019ll feel a bit short changed when he\u2019s expecting a pureblood Black and gets the half-blood kid he keeps calling\nLinchpin\n.\u201d\n\u201cUgh. He\u2019s such a slimy old tosser. Like an actual slug.\u201d Sirius smirked to himself and nudged Remus with his elbow, \u201cHeh, an actual slug, Moony.\u201d\nRemus smiled back, looking up from his book.\n\u201cAre you ready, then?\u201d James sighed, tossing away his comb, apparently accepting that his attempt was futile.\n\u201cS\u2019pose.\u201d Sirius grunted, getting up laboriously.\n\u201cI\u2019ll come down with you,\u201d Remus said, \u201cMight as well go to the library. Wanna come, Pete?\u201d\nPeter looked at him as if he was insane, and shook his head.\nJames, Sirius and Remus made their way down to the common room, where \u2013 much to James\u2019s glee \u2013 Lily was waiting for them in a very pretty turquoise dress. Unfortunately for James, however, as the three marauders approach it became clear that it was not him she was waiting for.\n\u201cRemus!\u201d She said, standing up.\n\u201cYou look nice, Evans,\u201d James said, hopefully. Sirius sighed loudly.\n\u201cI wanted to speak to\nRemus\n,\u201d Lily said, ignoring James. \u201cWill you walk with me to the party?\u201d\n\u201cNot going,\u201d Remus shrugged, \u201cNot invited.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Lily flushed a bit, looking embarrassed, \u201cSorry, I just assumed\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you want to talk about?\u201d Remus asked, impatiently. His book was heavy, and the full moon was due on Friday, making him more agitated than usual.\nLily eyed James and Sirius, clearly not wanting to say anything in front of them. Remus sighed, \u201cI\u2019m going to the library. If you want to walk that way with me then fine.\u201d It would take Lily out of her way, but Remus decided he didn\u2019t care. He pushed through the portrait hole and heard her scamper after him, her patent black party shoes clicking on the flagstones.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the book?\u201d Lily panted, struggling to catch up with Remus\u2019s long-legged stride.\n\u201cNothing.\u201d He said, deliberately covering the title with his arm, \u201cJust some research.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something nasty, is it?\u201d Lily asked, disapprovingly, \u201cIt\u2019s not another horrid thing to do to Severus?\u201d\n\u201cI knew that\u2019s what you wanted to talk about,\u201d Remus rolled his eyes, still walking.\n\u201cWell you have to admit, Sirius did start it that time in Hogsmeade, I mean he called Sev\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care, Lily.\u201d Remus snapped, turning a sharp corner, \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to be so nasty, Sirius and James were just having a laugh, and Snape had to go and make it personal.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Lily stamped her foot, \u201cYou\u2019re all as bad as each other!\u201d\n\u201cYou know he hates people like you, too, don\u2019t you?\u201d Remus countered, stopping now that they were outside the library. He rounded on her, \u201cYou know that his sort hate our sort.\u201d\n\u201c\u2019Our sort\u2019,\u201d Lily tutted, \u201cHonestly, this whole blood purity thing is getting ridiculous, and it doesn\u2019t excuse\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe made Marlene cry,\u201d Remus persisted, \u201cMary told us. What do you think he says behind\nyour\nback?\u201d\nLily\u2019s cheeks were pink again,\n\u201cSev would never say anything like that about me! He\u2019s my best friend!\u201d\n\u201cWell good for you, but the rest of us aren\u2019t so fortunate.\u201d Remus spat. Lily stared at him, blinking for a few moments, stunned into silence. She looked like she might cry, and Remus felt a tiny twinge of guilt. When she spoke again, her voice was meek and small.\n\u201cWhat are you going to do to him?\u201d\nRemus sighed. She might as well know.\n\u201cNot just him. All of them.\u201d He said, lowering his voice and bending down slightly in case they were overheard, \u201cAnd nothing bad. If he stops calling anyone else names, then nothing at all.\u201d\nShe looked at him, sceptically. He straightened up. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ll say. You\u2019ll be late for your party, go on.\u201d\n* * *\nLater that evening, Remus thought he had just about cracked it. He was sitting up in the common room and had made his final notes. Now all he needed was Sirius\u2019s list of replacement words and they could begin work on the prank. It was almost eleven o\u2019clock when the portrait hole swung open, and Lily Evans marched in with a face like thunder. There were odd silvery marks on her dress that caught the light as she charged in.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Evans?\u201d Remus asked, tentatively, still feeling a bit sorry for being so short with her outside the library.\n\u201cAsk\nthem\n.\u201d She hissed, furious, \u201cI\u2019m going for a shower.\u201d\nHe did not wonder who she was referring to, but if he had, it was answered within moments, as Sirius and James came through the portrait hole next, laughing hysterically. Remus couldn\u2019t help but grin too \u2013 their glee was infectious.\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\u201cIt was all Sirius, mate,\u201d James clapped his friend on the back, then bowed to him elaborately, fluttering his hand. Sirius did the same back,\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t have done it without you, my dear chap.\u201d\n\u201cDone\nwhat\n?\u201d Remus asked, trying to keep a lid on his irritation as it sprang up out of nowhere.\n\u201cSlugs.\u201d James said, \u201cSlugs, bloody everywhere. Started with these little jelly slug sweets that were laid out to eat,\u201d\n\u201cSimple enough transfiguration spell,\u201d Sirius shrugged with false modesty, throwing himself into an armchair and slinging one leg over the arm.\n\u201cBut then,\u201d James sat next to Remus, starry eyed, \u201cThen they started to multiply\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd this is why Evans is pissed off with you?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026 did you see the slimy bits on her dress? And um\u2026 in her hair a bit too, I think. They were really fast moving slugs, they kind of got everywhere\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo sense of humour, that one.\u201d Sirius yawned. \u201cShe ought to be thanking us for livening things up a bit.\u201d\n\u201cThe nerve of some people,\u201d Remus said, dryly.\n\u201cSee, you understand, Moony,\u201d Sirius grinned, \u201cYou\u2019d let us slime you, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\nRemus thought it best to ignore that, and addressed James instead,\n\u201cSo did Slughorn know it, was you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it was pretty obvious. We were the only ones not screaming.\u201d\n\u201cDetentions?\u201d\n\u201cThree weeks. Cauldron scrubbing. That\u2019s fine, helps build up my muscles.\u201d James flexed his arms which, it had to be said, didn\u2019t look particularly muscular.\n\u201cGood news, though,\u201d Sirius piped up, \u201cNo more parties for us \u2013 we\u2019re out of the slug club.\u201d\n\u201cAnd into the history books!\u201d James crowed, causing all three of them to dissolve into fits of laughter."

The evenings were getting darkest and Remus hardly ever went to watch the team practice any more, though Sirius and Peter usually did. Mary always went too, to watch Marlene. She was following them everywhere, these days.\n\u201cI just think we should test it,\u201d Remus bit his lip, watching Sirius cast a drying spell on James.\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Peter said, folding his arms, \u201cI won\u2019t be your guinea pig this time. Last time I couldn\u2019t get rid of that patch of purple hair for weeks!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d forgotten about that,\u201d Sirius said, dreamily, \u201cThat worked really well, once we\u2019d figured out the kinks.\u201d\n\u201cDo it on\nhim\n.\u201d Peter pointed at Sirius, \u201cIt\u2019s his turn.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t whinge, Pete,\u201d Sirius groaned. He flopped down on his bed. \u201cDo it on me, Moony, I\u2019m not a\ncoward\n.\u201d\n\u201cOk, fine,\u201d Remus withdrew his wand. Sirius leapt up,\n\u201cWait, you want to do it\nnow\n?!\u201d\n\u201cWell, the sooner the better\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the counter-jinx?!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve got that sorted,\u201d Remus let a smile creep onto his face. He knew for certain that the counter-jinx worked, but it was too much fun to watch Sirius squirm.\n\u201cOh for goodness\u2019 sake.\u201d James sighed, getting out of his quidditch gear, \u201cDo it to me, Lupin, I don\u2019t mind. Only I don\u2019t want to say any of the words on that awful list of yours. Can you do it for something else?\u201d\n\u201cIf you like,\u201d Remus replied.\n\u201cYeah, about this list, Moony\u2026\u201d Sirius said, picking it up off the bedside table,\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s\nreally\nlong.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus raised an eyebrow, \u201cWhat\u2019s your point? They\u2019re all insults for non-purebloods, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius said, scratching his chin, \u201cYeah, they are, but, um\u2026 well I just didn\u2019t think there were so many. Never seen them all written out like that. And anyway, where did you hear all of these?!\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you think?\u201d Remus met Sirius\u2019s eyes, deliberately. He\u2019d been waiting for something like this. \u201cDon\u2019t be a girl about it, Black, it doesn\u2019t bother me. Right, James, what word do you want to swap?\u201d\n\u201cEvans.\u201d Sirius said, suddenly, \u201cSick of hearing that come out of his mouth.\u201d\n\u201cOk,\u201d Remus smiled, \u201cThen change it to what?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me!\u201d James said, \u201cWe\u2019ll do a blind test so we know it definitely works. Pick something Black hasn\u2019t come up with yet.\u201d\nRemus nodded, scribbled something onto a piece of parchment, then raised his wand, concentrating. He flicked his wand sharply at James and uttered the incantation.\nAll four of them stood by, silently, watching.\n\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Remus said, \u201cDid you feel anything?\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d James looked down at himself, as if he expected to see something different.\n\u201cWell, say it, then!\u201d Sirius urged.\n\u201cHer full name,\u201d Remus added.\nJames cleared his throat theatrically, squaring his shoulders. He outstretched one arm and placed a hand on his chest as though he were about to make some grand announcement,\n\u201cLUMPY ELEPHANT DUNG.\u201d He proclaimed.\nPeter burst into a fit of giggles so strong he almost fell off the bed. Sirius whooped with laughter, and James turned bright red,\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were going to pick something like that!\u201d He said, \u201cThat\u2019s my future wife!\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s your future wife?\u201d Sirius asked, quickly,\n\u201cElephant dung.\u201d James replied, then clapped his hands to his mouth. \u201cLupin!\u201d\n\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t mind,\u201d Remus replied, business-like, \u201cNow, try saying \u2018Evans\u2019 again, but really\nreally\ntry to break my spell, ok?\u201d\n\u201cElephant dung.\u201d James said, promptly. Then with more force, \u201c\nElephant\ndung.\u201d He screwed up his eyes, \u201cEle-phan-t\u2026 d\u2026dung. Lumpy elephant dung.\u201d He hung his head, sadly.\nPeter could hardly breathe for laughing now, and Sirius had to lean on the bedpost for support.\n\u201cExcellent.\u201d Remus smiled. He put down his list. \u201cHey, it\u2019s six o\u2019clock. Shall we go for dinner?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, just do the counter-jinx first.\u201d James said.\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Remus shook his head solemnly, \u201cSorry Potter, but I want to test the spell thoroughly \u2013 we need to be sure it won\u2019t wear off too quickly. I\u2019ll un-jinx you tomorrow morning.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d James roared,\n\u201cOh yes!\u201d Sirius gasped, wiping tears from his eyes.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Remus said again, not sorry at all, \u201cJust be glad we didn\u2019t pick a common word, I s\u2019pose.\u201d\n\u201cB-but, what if I run into elephant dung?\u201d\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t think you will,\u201d Remus gave a small smile, \u201cHardly any elephants in Scotland.\u201d\nJames grimaced,\n\u201cYou know what I mean! Lumpy! Lumpy elephant dung?!\u201d\nRemus shrugged,\n\u201cDon\u2019t yell her name? Come on, I\u2019m starving!\u201d\n* * *\n\u201cJames! Look who it is!\u201d\n\u201cShut. Up.\u201d James gritted his teeth and looked stonily at his dinner plate. Sirius shook his head disapprovingly, the picture of piety.\n\u201cThat\u2019s no way to greet\u2026 what\u2019s her name?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not rising to it, you know. I\u2019m stronger than that.\u201d James said, viciously cutting into his steak and kidney pie.\n\u201cShe\u2019s right there, mate,\u201d Sirius said, trying to control his smirk, \u201cHow will she ever notice you if you don\u2019t call her?\u201d\n\u201cOi, Evans,\u201d Remus said, suddenly, waving at the redhead, \u201cWant to sit with us?\u201d\nShe stopped and looked at them, warily,\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a Gryffindor, we\u2019re Gryffindors\u2026\u201d Sirius said, getting up to give her his seat next to James, \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to sit together. Plus, it\u2019ll really bother Potter.\u201d\n\u201cWell in that case.\u201d Lily sat down. Sirius pushed Remus up to make room beside him. Lily looked at James curiously, who had turned beetroot red. \u201cWhy do I bother you, Potter?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t!\u201d He said, quickly, \u201cThey\u2019re just being prats.\u201d\n\u201cLanguage, Potter!\u201d Sirius said, severely, pouring gravy over his mashed potato and peas. \u201cThat\u2019s no way to speak in front of a lady.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Lily eyed Remus suspiciously, \u201cAre you all making fun of me?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re making fun of James.\u201d Peter squeaked, sounding as though he was having a hard time containing his excitement. For once, he was not the butt of the joke, and it was clearly a dizzying notion.\n\u201cI\u2019m testing a spell on him.\u201d Remus said, simply. Lily\u2019s eyes flashed as she analysed the situation.\n\u201cAnd what was the spell?\u201d\n\u201c\nMutatio Verbi\n.\u201d\nHer eyebrows shot up,\n\u201cIs that\u2026 oh my god, Remus, which word?!\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLumpy elephant dung.\u201d James said, glumly. Peter spat out his pumpkin juice and knocked his fork flying. Lily giggled, nervously,\n\u201cWhat did you say, Potter?\u201d\n\u201cLll\u2026Lumpy.\u201d James strained to fight the spell, \u201cLumpy elephant dung\u2026 lumpy.\u201d\n\u201cLumpy...?! Oh, for pity\u2019s sake!\u201d Lily glared at Sirius, \u201cIt\u2019s my name, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me!\u201d Sirius grinned, holding his hands up, \u201cIt was Moony\u2019s idea!\u201d\nLily turned to Remus, her frown disappearing,\n\u201cReally, Remus?\u201d\n\u201cErr\u2026 yeah, but it wasn\u2019t meant to be offensive or anyth-\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d She said, \u201cReally clever magic!\u201d\n\u201cWait until tomorrow!\u201d Peter said, recovering from his hysterics. Sirius kicked him under the table.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, elephant dung.\u201d James said, looking genuinely forlorn. This time, even Lily laughed.\n* * *\nWednesday 31\nst\nOctober 1973\n\u201cNothing\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\u201cWell they\u2019re not going to start insulting each other, are they?\u201d\n\u201cWe have to push them into it. Pete, go and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOi, I\u2019m pureblood!\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, fair play. Um\u2026 Moony, go and trip one of them or something. Do it to Snivellus. Or my cousin, yeah, get Cissy!\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus said, quietly. Ignoring the fact that he actually had no problem with Narcissa, he didn\u2019t want to be so obvious. \u201cWe\u2019ll just wait. Patience, Black, patience.\u201d\n\u201cBut it might take days.\u201d\n\u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d Mary said, stonily. \u201cYou three must be blind if you haven\u2019t seen what\u2019s going on around here.\u201d That shut them up.\nMary was sitting beside Sirius for the second time that week. Remus didn\u2019t mind \u2013 he liked Mary, she was funny and brusque and bolshie, but unfailingly kind and full of compassion. She was his\nfriend\n. But. Well, she wasn\u2019t a marauder, was she?! Her presence felt intrusive, somehow; didn\u2019t quite mesh with their usual back-and-forth. And she\nalways\nsat next to Sirius, which meant no one could talk to him without her listening in and batting her eyes. Of course, Remus knew that she fancied him and everything, but he wasn\u2019t sure that Sirius knew that yet \u2013 or perhaps that was how you were supposed to act when someone fancied you.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s been going on, then?\u201d James asked, very seriously. \u201cDo you get called stuff, MacDonald?\u201d\nShe shrugged, sipping her pumpkin juice.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been worse this year. You must know, Remus?\u201d\nRemus nodded, vaguely, looking away, as if he was more interested in watching the Slytherins. It was the Halloween feast, and everyone was in high spirits. Professor Flitwick had enchanted glittering black bats to swoop over their heads, fine silvery cobwebs glistened from the rafters, and the Great Hall was filled with the autumnal smells of roast pumpkin, wood smoke and baked apples.\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d James continued, slowly, \u201cHave all the muggleborns been getting it, then? Even\u2026 even elephant dung \u2013 oh for fuck\u2019s sake, Remus! Please fix me!\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019ll do my Potions homework.\u201d Remus replied, quick as a dart.\n\u201cFine! Anything! I\u2019ll give you my bloody broomstick if you\u2019ll just\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\nFinite\n.\u201d Remus pointed his wand at James. James stared at him, looking stunned. He cleared his throat,\n\u201cLily Evans.\u201d He said, very clearly, then grinned,\n\u201cWhat now, Potter?!\u201d Lily turned around, her conversation with Marlene interrupted.\n\u201cWill you go out with me?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d She turned away again.\n\u201cCheers Moony.\u201d\n\u201cAny time.\u201d\n\u201cWait.\u201d Sirius said, \u201cWait just a minute. The counter-jinx was\nFinite Incantatum\n?!\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u2019s just the standard counter spell!\u201d\nRemus shrugged,\n\u201cI never said it was anything difficult. You pure bloods don\u2019t have an ounce of common sense between you.\u201d\nMary squawked with laughter, James choked on his roast potato and Sirius slapped Remus on the back.\n\u201cI swear, Moony. When it comes to evil schemes, none of us have got anything on you.\u201d\nRemus flushed with pride and shook him off, returning to his dinner.\n\u201cLook!\u201d Peter cried, suddenly, pointing a chubby finger in the direction of the Slytherin table. A Hufflepuff second year had wandered too close to Mulciber, who stood up and was looming over them.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sirius whispered, \u201cGo on, you big troll\u2026\u201d\nThe Hufflepuff was trembling so much that they sloshed their drink, spilling most of it down their own robes, but also lightly sprinkling the toes of Mulciber\u2019s huge black shoes. The snub nosed Slytherin grabbed the Huffllepuff by the tie \u2013 the rest of the Slytherins turned to watch, eagerly.\n\u201cClean that up, you angelic sweetie-pops.\u201d\nDead silence. The Hufflepuff looked confused, and let out a nervous laugh. Mulciber looked stupider than usual.\n\u201cWhat did you say, Mulciber?\u201d Snape asked, staring at him.\n\u201c\nAngelic sweetie-pops\n!\u201d Mulciber roared, red-faced. \u201cNo! I meant \u2013\ndarling sugar plum\n! No!\nGoody-gumpdrops\n!\u201d\nThe entire hall erupted in laughter.\n\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Sirius said, under his breath, \u201cMulciber\u2019s really got a mouth on him, eh? I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d use half of those.\u201d\n\u201cSit down, you idiot.\u201d Snape chastised the bully, who had let go of the Hufflepuff\u2019s tie, and was helplessly spouting cutesy nonsense.\n\u201cThat was brilliant, Sirius!\u201d Mary hugged him. Remus suddenly lost his appetite. Sirius just tossed his hair gallantly,\n\u201cJust wait,\u201d he said, \u201cThat was just the beginning.\u201d"

            "content": "Friday 2\nnd\nNovember 1973\nRemus peered around the dorm room door quietly, and \u2013 finding the coast clear \u2013 crept inside. He carefully opened his trunk and shoved the package inside, covering it up with an old pair of jeans.\n\u201cHiya, Moony,\u201d a voice behind him gave Remus such a fright that he dropped the trunk lid with a heavy *THUNK* and spun around. James was emerging from the bathroom, his dark hair wet and his glasses steamed up.\n\u201cHi.\u201d He said, hoping he didn\u2019t look like he was up to anything.\n\u201cAre you up to something?\u201d James squinted at him.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cNothing!\u201d\n\u201cIs it Sirius\u2019s birthday present?\u201d\nRemus\u2019s shoulders sagged, he sighed.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide it from\nme\n, Moony,\u201d James laughed, easily, throwing his towel onto his bed and beginning to get dressed. \u201cI won\u2019t tell him.\u201d\nRemus just shrugged awkwardly. He\u2019d really only wanted to hide the fact that he had spent the past two hours in the fourth-floor girl\u2019s loos trying to wrap the stupid thing, with Moaning Myrtle cackling overhead, giving no useful advice at all.\nHe was also trying to avoid any awkward questions about where he\u2019d got the money. His stash of stolen cigarettes was now almost entirely depleted, and he had just about enough money left over to buy Christmas gifts for his friends and \u2013 if he was prudent \u2013 something for himself. He didn\u2019t have his heart set on anything, but Remus rather liked the idea that he could just go ahead and buy something if it caught his fancy.\n\u201cLucky it\u2019s a Saturday this year,\u201d he said to James, relaxing a bit, \u201cD\u2019you know what we\u2019re going to do?\u201d\n\u201cWell obviously, we\u2019ll have to sing \u2018happy birthday\u2019 at breakfast,\u201d James said, very seriously.\n\u201cObviously.\u201d Remus agreed.\n\u201cAnd lunch, and dinner. I\u2019ve got quidditch practice in the morning, but I got Hooch to let me have an extra half an hour on the pitch before the Ravenclaws go on, so we can do a bit of flying.\u201d\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d Remus said, with a little less enthusiasm. It wasn\u2019t his idea of a good time to sit in the quidditch stands alone on a cold November morning \u2013 but it was Sirius\u2019s birthday, after all. Maybe he could bring a book.\n\u201cThen I suppose he\u2019ll have to do that afternoon tea thing with Regulus and Narcissa. So, we\u2019ll have to find out when that ends before we can sort out a proper party. D\u2019you think the others \u2018ll mind if we use the common room?\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d Remus shook his head, with confidence. No one could deny James and Sirius anything \u2013 especially a very noisy birthday party. This was true at any given time during the year, but especially this week, when the marauder\u2019s popularity appeared to be at its peak.\nRemus had hardly been able to walk down a corridor since Wednesday without hearing a cheer, or getting a pat on the back from fellow Gryffindors, Ravenclaws or Hufflepuffs. The Slytherins still scowled, still glared daggers if he passed them \u2013 but they couldn\u2019t\nsay\nanything. A few tried, of course. For the first two days after Halloween, the occasional \u2018\nangelic sweetie pops\n\u2019 or \u2018\nhoney fluffkins\u2019\ncould be heard \u2013 and met with raucous laughter. Snape had even lost his temper completely during their Friday Charms lesson and called James a \u2018\nlovely little poppet\n\u2019, which nearly killed Sirius with laughter, and mortified Lily.\nThe best part of this prank, which Remus hadn\u2019t even considered when he\u2019d planned it, was that none of the Slytherins could complain to the staff about the spell \u2013 because that would mean explaining which words had been replaced. So, it was a slow and immensely enjoyable process to watch as the Slytherin students tried to figure out the counter curse by themselves.\n\u201cServes them right,\u201d Marlene giggled, early that morning, \u201cIf they were Hufflepuffs they\u2019d all have lifted the spell by now.\u201d\nOvernight, the marauders had gone from being class clowns \u2013 well-liked and cheerfully tolerated \u2013 to heroes of the house war that had been brewing all year. Remus tried not to think about the long-term effects this might have, and focussed instead on Sirius\u2019s upcoming fourteenth birthday. Somehow, fourteen sounded even more mature than thirteen \u2013 you were definitely\ndefinitely\na teenager at fourteen.\nMary sat with them at dinner that evening, yet again. Once or twice, Remus had thought about asking James how he felt about this new arrangement, but stopped himself. After all, James seemed not to care at all, and carried on as usual. And Mary wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong by sitting on her own house table.\nTruthfully, Remus had not yet been able to put his finger on why her presence bothered him so much, except that she always sat next to Sirius, which he thought was a bit of an obvious display. Sirius\u2019s continued coyness about the whole subject was just as infuriating. Remus didn\u2019t like other people keeping secrets.\n\u201cWhat time will you be free tomorrow, Black?\u201d James asked, as they tucked into crispy golden battered cod and thick cut chips.\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d Sirius asked, liberally splashing vinegar over his, before passing the bottle to Remus. Mary, who had been reaching for the vinegar, shot Remus a funny look.\n\u201cYou know, what time do you think your Black family tea will be finished? For your birthday?\u201d\n\u201cOooh, is it your birthday, Sirius?\u201d Mary smiled, \u201cYou never said! I would have got you something!\u201d\n\u201cWould you?\u201d Sirius looked at her, mildly puzzled. He turned back to James, \u201cI don\u2019t think the tea is happening this year. Haven\u2019t had a note.\u201d\n\u201cOh, really?\u201d James raised his eyebrows, which always gave him a bit of an owlish expression, \u201cAre you\u2026 I mean, is that ok?\u201d\nSirius snorted, looking at his food,\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be? Like I give a toss.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026 great, then.\u201d James grinned, shooting a look at Peter and Remus that only they would understand, \u201cWe can crack on with planning you the messiest party Gryffindor tower has ever seen.\u201d\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Peter added, for good measure.\n\u201cAm I invited?\u201d Mary asked, sitting up straighter.\n\u201cObviously.\u201d Remus said, his voice more sarcastic than he meant it to be, \u201c\nEveryone\u2019s\ninvited.\u201d\n\u201cLook, maybe don\u2019t make a big fuss.\u201d Sirius said, playing with his peas, \u201cI don\u2019t feel like it much.\u201d\n\u201cOh, why not?\u201d Mary cooed, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun! We\u2019ll make it as good as Remus\u2019s birthday last year \u2013 even better!\u201d\nSirius said nothing, and James threw another look at Peter and Remus. They ate the rest of their meal in almost total silence.\n* * *\nSaturday 3\nrd\nNovember 1973\nRemus woke up alone on the morning of Sirius\u2019s birthday, finding a note pinned to the bathroom door, written in beautiful cursive.\n\nGone for quidditch practice \u2013 knew you wouldn\u2019t want to come so let you lie in. See you later. S.\n\nRemus showered and then decided he may as well go to the library. He had finished his essay on class XXX magical creatures, and wanted to get a head start on class XXXX creatures. (He had recently learnt that he, skinny, thirteen-year-old Remus Lupin, was classified XXXXX, alongside manticores and dragons.)\nThey were going ahead with the party with or without Sirius\u2019s consent \u2013 a decision made by James and backed up by Remus. Even when he had a case of the blues, Sirius could not resist being the centre of attention and making as much noise as possible. Peter had been put in charge of decorations and \u2013 with some help from Mary and Marlene \u2013 had come up trumps, hiding a trunkful of streamers and balloons in the third year girl\u2019s dormitory. James handled the invitations \u2013 which as far as Remus had seen involved shouting at various students telling them they\u2019d better be there or else. Remus was responsible for food \u2013 something which was simple enough when you had access to the map and invisibility cloak.\nHe ate a quiet breakfast by himself with his book. Mealtimes were a much more peaceful affair since the Slytherins had been temporarily muzzled. Even those that had managed to break the spell were keeping their mouths shut, at least for a while.\nThe book Remus was reading was so interesting that he couldn\u2019t put it down, and instead continued to read as he meandered his way slowly towards the library, occasionally sticking his hand out to avoid crashing into any pillars or doorways. So, it was completely his own fault when he bumped headlong into Regulus Black, knocking the younger boy to the floor.\n\u201cOh, sorry!\u201d Remus said, dropping his book and automatically offering a hand to help him up. Regulus glared at him, and narrowed his eyes at the scars criss-crossing Remus\u2019s wrists. He climbed to his feet unassisted, brushing himself off, sniffing at Remus with his inherited Black dignity.\n\u201cWatch where you\u2019re going.\u201d He said, icily.\n\u201cI said sorry.\u201d Remus replied, a bit annoyed. He didn\u2019t want to start anything, he just wanted to get to the library without any trouble.\n\u201cWhat are you doing wandering about alone, anyway,\u201d Regulus asked, suspiciously, \u201cPlanning some other hilarious assault on our freedom of speech?\u201d\nRemus scoffed,\n\u201cI could ask you the same thing. Where\u2019s that creepy little Crouch kid? Anyway, you can\u2019t prove we did anything.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Regulus\u2019s lips curled, \u201cBut I know my brother was involved.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I didn\u2019t get the same words as everyone else.\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Remus tried to look unconcerned by this \u2013 but he\u2019d had no idea that Sirius had cursed his brother differently.\n\u201cEvery time I try to say my house\u2019s name, it comes out\u2026\u201d Regulus glanced furtively about himself, as if afraid he might be overheard, \u201c\nGo Gryffindor Go\n!\u201d\nRemus burst out laughing, under Regulus\u2019s imperious glare.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Remus said, for the third time, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 well it is quite funny.\u201d\n\u201cOf course\nyou\nthink it\u2019s funny.\u201d The younger boy sniffed. He was shorter than Remus, but somehow still managed to look down his nose at him, \u201cYou\u2026 your\nkind\ncan\u2019t possibly understand what my brother is putting a stake. I\u2019ve done my best to hide the worst of it from our parents, but he has to keep pushing it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSo is that why he\u2019s not invited to your stupid Nancy tea party?\u201d Remus asked, angry on his friend\u2019s behalf.\n\u201cNarcissa didn\u2019t think it was worth it, this year,\u201d Regulus\u2019s cold stare faltered, and he looked away. Remus had the impression that Regulus would have quite liked a chance to see his brother. \u201cAnd this latest joke of his has just proved it. He\u2019s never going to\u2026 to come back.\u201d\nRegulus shook himself and turned in the direction of the dungeons. Remus felt a surge of sympathy, and against his better judgement called him back,\n\u201cReg, wait!\u201d\nRegulus turned, looking horrified by Remus\u2019s overfamiliarity. But\nRegulus\nwas such an ugly mouthful of a name. Worse than Remus by a mile. \u201cLook,\u201d he hurried, \u201cWe\u2019re having a party for Sirius in the common room tonight, you can come if you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Regulus said, sharply, looking anxious, \u201cDon\u2019t invite me, ok? Just\u2026 leave it. Tell him happy birthday for me.\u201d He hurried away.\n* * *\nWith or without Regulus, the party was a roaring success. Quite literally; every lion motif in the common room (and there were quite a few) had been enchanted to roar every time anyone said the words \u2018birthday\u2019 or \u2018Sirius\u2019.\nThe whole of Gryffindor house got involved, and Remus was pretty sure that some of the older students were passing around flasks of something a bit stronger than the butterbeer everyone else was drinking. Sirius\u2019s record player was spinning wildly at double time, and lots of the girls had got up to dance. Mary tried to haul Sirius up for\nJohn, I\u2019m Only Dancing\n, but he shook his head fervently and stayed on the couch with Remus and Peter.\n\u201cI only know the waltz,\u201d he confided to them in a whisper, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be fucked if I ever do that again.\u201d\nJames did get up and tried to shake his hips as close to Lily as possible, but quickly tripped over a ruck in the rug and nearly went headlong into the fireplace. Sirius laughed heartily at this, and Remus was pleased to see that at least he wasn\u2019t letting his family get to him today. He decided not to tell Sirius about his encounter with Regulus just yet \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t make him any happier, so what was the point?\n\u201cYou\u2019re Lupin, aren\u2019t you?\u201d A girl leaned over the back of the sofa, her long black hair brushing Remus\u2019s shoulder. He\u2019d seen her before; she was a sixth year.\n\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d he nodded, jumping up.\n\u201cMy friend, Fariahah, says you\u2019re selling\u2014\u201d\n\u201cErr, come over here!\u201d He jumped in jerking his head wildly. He\u2019d so far managed to conduct his business privately and without the other marauders knowing. \u201cWhat\u2019d you want?\u201d He asked, once they were in the furthest corner away from Sirius and Peter.\n\u201cTwo packs of whatever you\u2019ve got.\u201d She said.\n\u201cA galleon.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d She exclaimed, \u201cBut Fariahah said it was five sickles a pack!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m running low on stock,\u201d Remus said, disinterested, \u201csupply and demand.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, fine.\u201d She folded her arms and tossed her head, \u201cA galleon.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t get them now. Meet me here at seven tomorrow. AM.\u201d\n\u201cOn a Sunday?!\u201d\n\u201cI have plenty of customers, y\u2019know.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, all right\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on there, Moony?\u201d Sirius eyed him as Remus returned to the couch. His suspicious look was identical to his brother\u2019s. \u201cNot\nanother\ngirlfriend?\u201d\n\u201cShuddup,\u201d Remus kicked him.\n\u201cWho\u2019s your girlfriend, Remus?\u201d Mary sat up, looking interested.\nGod\n, Remus thought,\nwhere did she come from?!\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a girlfriend, Black\u2019s just being a dick.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Mary settled down, smiling smugly, \u201cBecause if you did,\u201d She twirled her corkscrew hair around one finger, \u201cI know someone who\u2019d be really disappointed\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh. Ok.\u201d He replied, trying not to show her how annoyed he was.\n\u201cWho fancies Moony?\u201d Sirius asked, nudging Mary.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly tell you.\u201d Mary replied, mimicking buttoning her lips. Remus wished she\u2019d do that for real, for good.\n\u201cGirls.\u201d Sirius said, with exasperation, \u201cNightmares, the bloody lot of you.\u201d\nMary mock-pouted, but said nothing more. Sirius shook his head at her, but he was smiling. Finally, he returned to Remus, \u201cSo what are you selling? That girl said you were selling something.\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d Remus said, innocently. \u201cShe had the wrong person.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll work it out, you know.\u201d Sirius said, a look of glee in his deep blue eyes. \u201cNot that I\u2019m not grateful for the truly excellent birthday present,\u201d he nodded at the floor where his recently unwrapped\nZonko\u2019s Deluxe practical joke kit\nlay, proudly proclaiming; \u2018\nSure to complete the collection of any master prankster\u2019.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m going to figure out how you paid for it, eventually. I don\u2019t believe this stuff about a dead aunt leaving you money.\u201d\n\u201cYour dead uncle left you money,\u201d Remus countered.\n\u201cCan\u2019t touch it \u2018til I\u2019m of age though, can I?\u201d Sirius said, shrewdly, \u201cNope, you\u2019re up to something, Lupin, I know you \u2013 you\u2019re not Moony if you don\u2019t have a secret.\u201d\n\u201cSo let me have my secret then,\u201d Remus turned his head, mysteriously."

            "content": "Sunday 11\nth\nNovember 1973\nRemus fell awake, spluttering and shivering. The room was gloomy, and his breath blew out in white plumes above his head. Everything hurt. He raised his hands in front of his face and found his fingertips blue and bloody. There were splinters under his nails, and more blood somewhere else \u2013 he could smell it, but he couldn\u2019t see very well in the dark and he didn\u2019t have the energy to lift his head. His bones felt like they were made of chalk. He was so, so tired.\nStill, if there was as much blood as he thought, it probably wasn\u2019t a good idea to sleep. He ought to stay awake at least until Madam Pomfrey could arrive \u2013 which shouldn\u2019t be long. Remus lay still and focussed on his breathing. There was a Gryffindor game on today as well, another thing he\u2019d be missing. Not only that, but his friends would be too busy to visit.\nHe turned his head and heaved. He hoped he wouldn\u2019t be sick, it was so embarrassing being sick. He didn\u2019t have his wand with him, so he couldn\u2019t clean it up.\n\u201cGood morning, Remus,\u201d Madam Pomfrey finally entered the room. \u201cOh dear, bit of a mess, eh?\u201d\nHe raised his head, and promptly threw up.\n* * *\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I like all this reading you do.\u201d Madam Pomfrey tutted as she brought him a healing draught. \u201cI know your studies are important to you, but you need rest.\u201d\n\u201cI slept all morning.\u201d He replied, \u201cAnd I get so bored, otherwise. Do you know how the quidditch match went?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t,\u201d the medi-witch smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sure Mr Potter will be up here to tell you as soon as he can, though.\u201d\nThat wasn\u2019t very likely, if they\u2019d won \u2013 there would be a victory party, and Remus had made James promise not to miss it on his account. He accepted the potion he was given, and swallowed it all without complaint. It was bitter, but he\u2019d grown used to it now.\nHe had to read, because if he didn\u2019t, he would have nothing to do at all, except think about his fresh scars. This month the wolf had torn at his torso, which was better than his arms or face \u2013 at least he could hide the marks easier.\nRemus rarely undressed in front of anyone; even once the marauders had found out about his furry little problem. No one but Madam Pomfrey had seen the true extent of the damage (well, Sirius had, once, early in second year, but neither of them had since acknowledged that strange encounter). Still, Remus wasn\u2019t na\u00efve, and he knew that one day, however far away it might be,\nsomeone\nwould expect him to take his top off \u2013 at the very least. It didn\u2019t bear thinking about. Perhaps he\u2019d just have to avoid girls forever.\n\u201cMr Lupin!\u201d A cheerful voice boomed across the hospital floor, making Remus jump. It was Professor Ferox, holding two large jars of clear liquid in his arms.\n\u201cOh, hello,\u201d Remus gave a small wave.\n\u201cMurtlap essence, as promised, Poppy,\u201d the professor set down the jars.\nDon\u2019t come over, don\u2019t come over,\nRemus thought frantically as Professor Ferox strode across the room towards his bed. \u201cBeen in the wars, our kid?\u201d He asked, kindly.\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Remus wanted to shrink and hide under the bedsheets. He hated the thought of strong, energetic Ferox seeing him in his weakened state. \u201cI\u2019m ok.\u201d\nFerox sat down beside Remus\u2019s bed. Remus resigned himself to his fate.\n\u201cSecond time in here this year, eh?\u201d The professor said, looking concerned. Remus nodded, even though it was his third moon this term. If Ferox hadn\u2019t noticed one absence, then perhaps he wouldn\u2019t connect the dots. \u201cYou know, if you need some more time for your homework, you only need to ask.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never handed anything in late!\u201d Remus protested.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ferox\u2019s eyes twinkled, \u201cYou certainly haven\u2019t.\u201d His eyes moved to the bandages poking out of Remus\u2019s pyjama vest, covering a new cut that snaked up his collar bone. Something registered in the older man\u2019s eyes, and Remus knew almost instinctively that Ferox\nknew\n.\n\u201cI can do anything anyone else can.\u201d Remus said, looking his teacher in the eye.\n\u201cI can see that.\u201d Ferox now eyed the pile of books on the bedside table. \u201cAre these all for school?\u201d\n\u201cSome of them.\u201d Remus replied, \u201cSome are for fun. I like finding out new stuff. I like knowing stuff.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I can tell that from your essays,\u201d Ferox was smiling again, which made Remus relax a bit. \u201cDo you fancy a career caring for magical creatures? Or maybe something more like your father?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 I hadn\u2019t thought about it.\u201d Remus lied.\nFerox laughed. He tapped the book at the top of the pile. It was borrowed from Sirius \u2013 a muggle philosophy book.\n\u201c\nKnow thyself\n, Remus.\u201d Ferox said.\n\u201cPlato.\u201d Remus said quickly.\nFerox laughed again, standing up.\n\u201cExactly.\u201d He ruffled Remus\u2019s hair before turning to leave, \u201cI hope you feel better soon, Lupin. See you on Wednesday.\u201d\nIt was all very cryptic, Remus thought, realising he\u2019d been holding his breath for almost a minute as Ferox left the room. He hadn\u2019t started the Plato yet, only skimmed it \u2013 it wasn\u2019t the sort of thing he was usually interested in, but he\u2019d committed to try a bit of everything.\nSecretly, he wanted to be able to show off to Sirius that he had read more books. Sirius hardly spent any time reading any more \u2013 his single-minded mission to fulfil his role as the Black family black sheep meant that he had little time for anything other than causing trouble. He\u2019d regret that, one day, in Remus\u2019s opinion. Remus had seen plenty of boys at St Edmund\u2019s trying to push their limits like that \u2013 the problem was, some limits weren\u2019t fences. Sometimes they were edges; with nothing on the other side.\n* * *\nHe healed pretty well, despite the brutal scarring, and Madam Pomfrey sent him back to Gryffindor tower that evening, with the understanding that he did nothing but rest. He walked slowly, as promised. When he finally reached the common room, he did not find the victory party he had expected, but a rather subdued atmosphere, and the marauders were nowhere to be seen.\nRemus furrowed his brow, and headed up the stairs to find the bedroom also empty. Puzzled, he went back downstairs. Marlene and Mary were playing snap by the fireplace.\n\u201cHiya,\u201d he went over.\n\u201cAll right, Remus? Where\u2019ve you been?\u201d Mary asked, not looking up from her cards.\n\u201cBeen sick. Stomach bug. How was the game?\u201d\n\u201cWe lost,\u201d Marlene sighed, \u201cJames was bloody brilliant as usual, and I must have blocked at least twenty bludgers, but Ramsay caught the snitch right at the wrong time.\u201d\n\u201cAh, sorry McKinnon.\u201d Remus rubbed the back of his head. That was odd \u2013 if they\u2019d lost, and there had been no party, then why hadn\u2019t the others come to see him? He tried to ignore the stabbing feeling in his stomach. \u201cYou seen James since? Or Sirius or anyone?\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d The girls said in unison. Marlene slammed down a card, then winced as it blew up. She looked up,\n\u201cWant to play?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 nah. I still feel a bit funny. Going to lie down. Thanks, though.\u201d\nHe trudged back up the stairs, feeling an uncomfortable mix of anxiety and anger. He\u2019d said they shouldn\u2019t put off celebrating just for him, but that didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t want to see them\nat all\n. They didn\u2019t have to leave him on his own like that, without so much as checking to see if he was ok. For all they knew, he could be in the infirmary still, at death\u2019s door and with no one but Madam Pomfrey for company. Were they bored of the whole thing? Was it less exciting now? Was\nhe\nless exciting?\nRemus lay on his bed on top of the covers. He felt like he\u2019d only been out of pyjamas for an hour, he didn\u2019t want to get back into them, no matter how tired he was. He considered reading, but he didn\u2019t have the energy. He could listen to a record, but that would mean getting up. In the end, he stayed put, lying in the dark with the curtains drawn.\nAt St Edmund\u2019s, before he could read, before he had magic, or friends, Remus had grown used to boredom. He would make up stories in his head, run through song lyrics he had memorised, or try to come up with the longest words he\u2019d ever heard. Now, as he waited for sleep to come, Remus pondered on what Ferox had said to him earlier.\nKnow thyself. He couldn\u2019t remember the context for Plato having said that \u2013 it had to mean \u2018know who you are\u2019.\nRemus knew all about his friends. He knew that James was a natural leader, a quidditch god who would do anything for anyone. Remus knew that even though they all teased James for being infatuated with Lily, James had a clearer understanding of love than anyone, and if he said he was going to marry her one day then he probably would. Remus knew that Peter was ashamed of his family, especially his older sister who he\u2019d once looked up too, and that fitting in meant more to him than anything else in the world. Remus knew that Mary\u2019s parents were born in Jamaica, and that she was the only witch in a family of seven, and that she never, ever cried, even when she was furious. He knew that\nLily\ncried every time she got a letter from home, and that she wrote to her sister every week and hadn\u2019t once received a response. He knew that Marlene didn\u2019t get on very well with her dad, who was a muggle, and who drank too much sometimes.\nThen there was Sirius \u2013 but it took nothing special to know Sirius. He\nthought\nhe was aloof and mysterious, but the truth was that Black wore his heart on his sleeve, and kept nothing back. He felt everything so strongly, and his happiness was as chaotic as his misery. Sometimes you had to take a step back, in case you got dragged under his wheels.\nWho was Remus, then? An orphan \u2013 but not quite. A wizard, but only half-blood. A monster, but not every day. What else was there? No need to flesh out supporting characters too much.\n*CREAK*\n\u201cMoony?\u201d The whisper filled the room as loud as a klaxon. Remus did not reply. He was too grumpy.\nThe door opened, and three sets of footsteps entered. Even with the bedcurtains drawn, Remus knew it was James who approached first. \u201cPsst, Moony? You sleeping, mate?\u201d\nHe sighed, rolling over.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nThe curtains were pulled aside. Remus sat up to make room as James, then Sirius, then Peter crawled inside to sit with him.\n\u201cWe went to the hospital wing, but she said you\u2019d gone already.\u201d James explained.\n\u201cCame up after dinner. Where were you?\u201d\n\u201cLibrary.\u201d\n\u201cHow was it?\u201d Sirius asked, \u201cThe full moon and everything?\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d He gave the same answer every month.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 I mean, you weren\u2019t cut up, too much?\u201d Peter asked, wringing his hands.\n\u201cA bit.\u201d Remus nodded, \u201cNot too bad. What were you doing in the library?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we wanted to talk to you about!\u201d Sirius burst out. Obviously he was dying to say something, and Remus felt the last of his irritation melt away as his curiosity peaked.\n\u201cSirius.\u201d James said, in the voice he used to temper his friends. He looked at Remus, \u201cWe were doing some research, and it\u2019s sort of about you.\u201d\n\u201cSort of!\u201d Sirius scoffed, \u201cIt\u2019s\nall\nabout you, Moony, I\u2019ve wanted to tell you since last term, but James wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI just wanted to make sure we could do it.\u201d James elbowed Sirius, \u201cStop interrupting me, bloody hell. Remus. The thing is, ever since we found out about \u2026um\u2026 your furry little problem, we\u2019ve wanted to do something to help.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no cure.\u201d Remus replied, quickly. He didn\u2019t like the sound of this. He felt horribly self-conscious as they all stared at him with the same mad look in their eyes.\n\u201cNo no, we know that,\u201d James waved a hand, \u201cBut we thought there must be\nsomething\nwe could do \u2013 to make you stop hurting yourself, you know.\u201d\n\u201cWe found out that normal werewolves don\u2019t do that,\u201d Peter said, eager to have his own say, \u201cSo w--\u201d\n\u201cNormal?!\u201d Remus said, alarmed.\n\u201cNot\nnormal\n,\u201d Sirius kicked Peter, \u201c\nOthers\n. Others like you. Who don\u2019t get locked up during the moon.\u201d\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re probably doing it to yourself because you\u2019re trapped, and frustrated.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026 yeah, I knew that.\u201d Remus drew his knees up to his chest and inched back a bit. He wished they weren\u2019t on his bed, they were all much too close. He could smell their blood; he could hear it rushing in their veins.\n\u201cBut we thought if you had company--\u201d\n\u201cObviously not human company,\u201d James explained, hurriedly, \u201cEverything we\u2019ve read says that if you even get\nnear\na human then they\u2019re a goner,\u201d\n\u201cBut animals!\u201d Sirius exploded, \u201cOther animals would probably be fine!\u201d His eyes shone with excitement, and Remus wished he could return it, but he was too distracted to be able to follow what they were saying.\n\u201cSo what? I need a pet?\u201d\nJames laughed,\n\u201cSort of. But we thought\u2026\nwe\ncould be the animals.\u201d\nRemus stared at him. He looked at each of his friends in turn. They were all barking mad.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be animals.\u201d He said, flatly.\n\u201cLike McGonagall!\u201d Peter squeaked.\n\u201cLike\u2026 but she\u2019s an animagus! You have to study, and train, and get registered, and you can\u2019t even\nstart\nuntil you\u2019re seventeen\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMoony, Moony, Moony,\u201d Sirius shook his head, infuriatingly, \u201cWe\u2019re\nmarauders\n. We don\u2019t need to bother with all of that.\u201d\n\u201cEven if you wanted to break the law,\u201d Remus caught James\u2019s eye on that point, to confirm that this was definitely what they were talking about, \u201cThis isn\u2019t some school prank. It\u2019s serious magic \u2013 one of the hardest things to do!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re telling you about it,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cI wanted it all to be a surprise, but James reminded us that\u2026 well, it is really bloody hard, so the more help we get the better.\u201d\n\u201cYou really think you can do it, don\u2019t you?\u201d Remus frowned.\n\u201cIf you help us.\u201d James nodded, \u201cWe\u2019re the best students in the year, except for Evans. Don\u2019t see why we shouldn\u2019t try.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if it goes wrong?!\u201d Remus chewed his lip, \u201cWhat if I still\u2026 after I transform, what if I can tell you\u2019re not really animals? What if I go for you anyway?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll test it. We\u2019ll test it over and over until we know it\u2019s safe.\u201d Sirius said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so risky\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know!\u201d Black\u2019s eyes were practically blazing in his head now, and Remus knew there was no point trying to be reasonable. He took a deep breath.\n\u201cLet me think about it, please?\u201d He appealed to James. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything yet. Just\u2026 give me a few days.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d James nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d\n\u201cJust think, Moony!\u201d Sirius grinned, as if he hadn\u2019t heard them, \u201cOnce we\u2019ve done this, there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t do. We\u2019ll be unstoppable!\u201d"

            "content": "Friday 21\nst\nDecember 1973\nOnce he was finally given the space to think about it, Remus wondered why he\u2019d even asked for more time. Of\ncourse\nhe would say yes. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever say no to his friends, even if it made him nervous. And it did make him nervous.\nPerhaps it was their excitement that worried him \u2013 or their over-confidence. He knew that part of their eagerness had to do with the plan being incredibly illegal, dangerous and reckless. But they were also doing it for\nhim\n. He wasn\u2019t sure how to feel about that yet. \u00a0Better not to think about it.\nHe took James aside one day not long after they\u2019d proposed the idea, and asked for all of the research they had so far. It was promptly presented to him as a huge bundle of parchment; reams and reams of notes and diagrams penned in a familiar neat cursive script. To say that they had been thorough was an understatement. If only Sirius paid that much attention to writing his essays, Remus would never have a hope of beating him to the top of the class.\nThey had left no stone unturned. They\u2019d charted the full moons for the next decade, at least. They\u2019d practically written an entire history of European lycanthropy, along with feeding habits and migration patterns, pack behaviour, canine communication signals. They had listed every ingredient they would need, its\u2019 cost and availability. Every ritual was carefully transcribed, step by step and the incantations spelled out phonetically. There were timelines, suggested locations for certain aspects of the extensive process \u2013 everything was painstakingly detailed.\n\u201cChrist.\u201d Remus said, when he had finished reading it. \u201cYou\u2019ve done all of this\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt was mostly Sirius.\u201d James grinned, \u201cActually, basically all of it was Sirius. He did most of it over the summer holidays, while he was bored. A real labour of love.\u201d\nRemus\u2019s stomach flipped. He didn\u2019t know what to say \u2013 how could he refuse them after all that? Suddenly selling stolen cigarettes to underage wizards seemed very tame indeed.\nIt was agreed that work would begin in earnest over the Christmas holidays, when they would all be away from Hogwarts. Remus had secured permission from Matron, McGonagall\nand\nMadam Pomfrey to spend the break with the Potters, and as always, Peter was only up the road. Sirius was in a dark mood as term drew to a close \u2013 until he received a very short note during breakfast one morning:\n\n\n\n\nTo Master S. O. Black III,\n\n\nYou will not be required at the family home this winter break. Do as you please.\n\n\nSigned,\n\n\nOrion Black.\n\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d James cheered, almost knocking over his porridge, \u201cMight even get you for the summer, at this rate!\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Regulus?\u201d Remus asked, tentatively, quietly in case Sirius wanted to pretend he hadn\u2019t heard.\n\u201cOh, little Prince Reg is going home for Christmas,\u201d Sirius replied, shoving the note into his pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s just me they\u2019ve disinvited. Good. Perfect. Excellent. They don\u2019t care; I don\u2019t care.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t properly cheer up until they were packing. Sirius covertly showed Remus the gifts he had bought for Mr and Mrs Potter \u2013 a beautiful golden watch chain and a pretty garnet broach.\n\u201cD\u2019you think they\u2019re ok?\u201d He asked, nervously, \u201cMy family\u2019s shit at doing presents, so I never really know\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBlack\u2026 Sirius, they\u2019re\u2026 I mean, they\u2019re perfect. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d Remus felt a sinking feeling as he thought about the slightly shabby box of mid-range biscuits he\u2019d bought for his hosts. It couldn\u2019t be helped now, he had done his best.\nRemus was actually looking forward to Christmas this year, for what may have been the very first time. He was still a bit shy about spending time in someone else\u2019s house, but now that he knew how the Potters were, he relaxed into the idea. He had sold the very last of his illicit cigarettes at a premium, and bought presents for everyone he could \u2013 even Lily, Mary and Marlene. It was a real pleasure, giving people presents, he realised. Maybe even better than getting them.\nIn addition, despite some reservations, Remus was excited about beginning the animagus process. It would be some of the most complex magic they had performed yet \u2013 he had asked McGonagall about it, as subtly as possible. She had praised him for taking an interest, but said it was well above third year standard, or even seventh year. He relished the thought of proving her wrong.\nThere was one other thing he was hoping to get out of the break. Something he hadn\u2019t mentioned to the others, because it was private. Last year, at the Potter\u2019s Christmas party, Remus had been accosted by an old man who knew a lot about Lyall Lupin. At the time, Remus had been struck mute by the revelation and shock of it \u2013 but now, a year older and feeling quite mature at the grand old age of thirteen, Remus hoped he might learn a bit more.\n* * *\nSaturday 22\nnd\nDecember 1973\nThe full moon had fallen earlier in the month this year, so all four of the marauders were able to join their peers aboard the Hogwarts Express on the usual Saturday. In a change from their usual train journey, Marlene and Mary joined the boys in their carriage. Remus suspected that Lily was somewhere on her own with Severus, probably listening to him whinge about how nobody liked him.\n\u201cDid you get your essay back off Ferox?\u201d Marlene asked Remus, a deep crease in her brow, \u201cI only barely got an \u2018Acceptable\u2019 mark, and mum\u2019s going to go mental if I don\u2019t get better results this year.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I did ok\u2026\u201d Remus replied, embarrassed by his third \u2018Outstanding\u2019 that term.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll bring back the study club after Christmas, right?\u201d Mary put in, \u201cLily\u2019s up for it. Don\u2019t worry, Marls, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cSounds good.\u201d Remus nodded.\n\u201cMoony\u2019s joined a club without us!\u201d Sirius wailed, pretending to weep on James\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a big boy, now,\u201d James patted his friend, solemnly, \u201cThey grow up so fast.\u201d\n\u201cPiss off.\u201d Remus grinned, \u201cThey have slug club for posho\u2019s like you.\u201d\n\u201cYou can study with us if you want, Sirius,\u201d Mary purred.\nSirius looked alarmed \u2013 he used the library exclusively as a resource for jinx and hexes, not for doing anything so mundane as\nhomework\n. Mary didn\u2019t know Sirius. Not really.\nWhen they pulled into King\u2019s Cross, Remus felt a certain thrill when he saw that Mr and Mrs Potter were there to collect all of them. Usually he had to cross the barrier and go looking for Matron in the caf\u00e9 or by the newspaper stand. He was in for a shock, however, when he learnt that he was about to apparate for the first time.\n\u201cHold my arm, dear,\u201d Mrs Potter smiled at him kindly, \u201cClose your eyes, it\u2019ll all be over in a moment.\u201d\nRemus obeyed, scrunching his eyes shut.\nIt was\nmuch\nworse than floo powder. Worse than flying. He nearly dragged Mrs Potter down with him when they landed, as he lost balance and fell hard on the pavement outside the Potter\u2019s house.\n\u201cWhoops-a-daisy!\u201d Mrs Potter laughed kindly, pulling him up again. \u201cYou\u2019re all right now.\u201d She brushed his knees and shoulders. \u201cNow, I\u2019ll just pop back for Sirius, Monty will be over with James in two ticks.\u201d\nAnd with a CRACK, she vanished. Remus barely had time to lean on the low front gate and catch his breath before there was another CRACK, and Mr Potter appeared with James, who didn\u2019t look half as bad as Remus felt.\nOnce they were all there, Mrs Potter ushered them all into the house, sending their trunks flying up the stairs to their respective bedrooms, boiling a kettle and slicing some homemade madeira cake all in what felt like a few seconds. As Remus sat at the Potter\u2019s big wooden kitchen table eating cake and sipping a huge mug of tea, listening to James and Sirius chatter nineteen to the dozen about the term so far, he couldn\u2019t resist sighing contentedly to himself. Two whole weeks of this.\nUnfortunately, unlike the previous year, there had been no snow yet this winter, only rain. In fact, as the evening drew on the downpour grew heavier and heavier, until thunder cracked open the sky outside, and hailstones battered the window panes. Rather than go outside, the boys sat in the living room under the Christmas tree playing games and toasting the occasional teacake on the fire. Remus himself settled into a book on human transfiguration, and Mrs Potter reviewed her lists for the coming celebrations.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve a few more people coming this year,\u201d she explained, as the long thin strips of parchment hovered before her, a royal blue quill working quickly across the surface, ticking off various items. \u201cSome friends from the old days, and some newer acquaintances,\u201d as she said this, she glanced furtively over at Sirius, who wasn\u2019t paying attention, immersed in the game. \u201cOnly just have enough room for all of you!\u201d She continued, with a happy smile that was just like her son\u2019s.\nJust then, there was a knock at the door. Sirius sat bolt upright, as if he\u2019d been stuck by lightening. He turned to Mrs Potter wide-eyed. It wasn\u2019t his mother, Remus knew this \u2013 but he didn\u2019t say so, because how on earth would that sound?\n\u2018Don\u2019t worry, Sirius,\n\nI know your mother\u2019s scent.\u2019\nToo bloody creepy.\nMrs Potter got up, leaving the lists hovering in mid-air, and went to answer the door. A cold breeze blew in, and the three boys listened intently. It was a woman, but her voice was higher and younger than that of Walpurga Black. She sounded as though she was crying, and Mrs Potter spoke in soothing tones.\n\u201cBoys!\u201d She called from the hallway. They got up and went to meet her. She was standing just inside the kitchen doorway. Behind her, a young woman with long blonde hair sat at the table, her head in her hands.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, mum?\u201d James asked, craning his neck.\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting late \u2013 you\u2019d all better go to bed. Philly\u2019s staying the night, and I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve no room left \u2013 Sirius, would you mind sharing with James tonight, dear?\u201d\n\u201cWe can all share,\u201d James said, generously, \u201cEveryone else is arriving tomorrow anyway, might as well just all bunk up together.\u201d\nMrs Potter nodded, and summoned the house elf.\nJames\u2019s bedroom was absolutely perfect in every way. Huge and spacious, the walls were plastered with Gryffindor banners and quidditch posters. Every broom he\u2019d ever owned was mounted on the wall, and his shelves were packed with wizard children\u2019s books and old toys that he clearly wasn\u2019t ready to let go of just yet. Chief among these was a little knight figurine, apparently supposed to be Godric Gryffindor himself, marching back and forth along the edge of the bookcase.\nThe bed was huge, hung with red velvet drapes, the same as their dorm room, and though it was big enough for all three of them, the house elf had whipped up two single beds which lay at the foot of it.\n\u201cWho was that?\u201d Remus asked, as they all sat on the big bed together in their pyjamas.\n\u201cPhilomena,\u201d James said, \u201cPete\u2019s sister.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing here?\u201d\n\u201cI think she\u2019s been arguing with Pete\u2019s folks \u2013 they don\u2019t like her going to muggle university, and,\u201d he lowered his voice, \u201cDad says she\u2019s got a muggle boyfriend.\u201d\n\u201cReally?!\u201d Sirius\u2019s eyes widened in awe. Remus said nothing \u2013 he hadn\u2019t known that going out with muggles was particularly taboo.\n\u201cYeah, and you know what mum\u2019s like,\u201d James nudged Sirius, \u201cLoves taking in strays.\u201d\n* * *\nChristmas Eve, 1973\nPhilomena was present at breakfast the next morning, and remained for the whole of Christmas. At first, she didn\u2019t say very much, but stared into space, pale faced and red eyed. From what Remus had gathered, going out with a muggle was not only taboo, but an offence worthy of disowning your own child. Apart from the Potters, Remus couldn\u2019t help but think that wizards did not make very good parents, based on his experience.\nPeter\u2019s sister was about seven years older than him, and you might not know they were related at all, other than their straw-coloured hair. Where Pete was round and podgy, Philomena was slim and dainty-featured. She had chocolate brown eyes and a delicate smattering of pale brown freckles over her little nose. Her hair was worn in the same style as many muggle girls Remus had seen; long and poker-straight with a thick parted fringe, like Marianne Faithfull.\nJames, who knew her best, could not do enough for the pretty visitor. He offered her tea, held out her chair and generally became her willing servant, until even Sirius had had enough of him.\n\u201cBloody hell, Potter, she\u2019s just a\ngirl\n.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m being nice.\u201d James frowned. \u201cNothing wrong with being nice to my mate\u2019s sister.\u201d\nThey hadn\u2019t seen Peter. Once Mrs Pettigrew learnt where her daughter was staying, he had been confined to the house. They were making do by sending owls back and forward, which was probably more fun for James and Sirius than it was for Peter.\n\u201cWhat would Evans say?\u201d Sirius teased James, who turned bright red.\n\u201cShe\u2019d be glad someone\u2019s taken his mind off her,\u201d Remus suggested from where he was lounging on his camp bed.\n\u201cYou can talk, Black.\u201d James shoved his friend, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on between you and Mary?\u201d\n\u201cMacdonald?\u201d Sirius asked, innocently, \u201cDunno what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\u201cOh come\non\n,\u201d James groaned, \u201cTell us! Have you snogged her or what?\u201d\nRemus dropped his book. Snogging?! Since when was snogging on the cards?! Sirius gave a coy look.\n\u201cNo. Kissed her cheek though.\u201d\n\u201cOhhh, how\nscandalous\n, Black!\u201d James threw a pillow at him. Sirius threw it back and all of a sudden they were wrestling.\nRemus usually just rolled his eyes and let them get on with it. But now he used the distraction to gather his thoughts \u2013 he felt very childish and silly, not having realised that Sirius liked Mary back. That there was\nkissing\ninvolved now, even if it was just a peck on the cheek. Remus wracked his brain, trying to put himself in Sirius\u2019s position. If a girl liked you, you pretty much had to kiss them, wasn\u2019t that the case? Was it awful if a girl didn\u2019t like you? If Sirius now liked Mary, and James liked Lily, ought\nhe\nto pick a girl too? Marlene was ok. A bit shy, like him. Maybe Marlene, then.\nThe thought kept him up that night, long after James and Sirius had fallen asleep. They both slept in James\u2019s bed \u2013 Sirius had simply climbed in on the first night and James hadn\u2019t said a word. Remus kept to himself, on his designated camp bed. He tried to take his mind off it, think about Christmas and stockings and crackers \u2013 but it was all in vain. All he could think about was Sirius kissing Mary\u2019s cheek. And where had they done it? When had it happened? What did it feel like?\nEventually, restless and overwrought, he got up to get some water. He padded out of the room, into the bathroom across the hall and ran the tap. He sipped some of the tepid water, and looked at himself in the mirror. In the dim light, he couldn\u2019t see his scars. Would a girl ever like him, if he looked the way he looked? He would never be as good looking as Sirius, or even James, but perhaps he was slightly better than Peter? How on earth could you\nknow\n?!\nSuddenly, the lights flashed on, burning his retinas, so that he almost dropped his glass.\n\u201cOh, sorry!\u201d Philomena stood in the doorway in a long peach-coloured nightie. She looked shocked, \u201cWhat are you doing wandering around in the dark?!\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 I have really good eyesight.\u201d He mumbled, stepping away from the sink. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d\n\u201cMe neither,\u201d she sighed. Once the surprise had left her face, she looked sad again. Remus hoped she wouldn\u2019t cry. He was useless with crying \u2013 oh god, if he got a girlfriend would he have to deal with crying?! He had no time to swallow back his panic, before Philomena began talking again, \u201cIt\u2019s horrible to be away from family at Christmas, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 I grew up in a children\u2019s home, actually.\u201d\n\u201cOh really?\u201d She looked interested for a moment, \u201cYou\u2019re one of Peter\u2019s little friends, aren\u2019t you? I didn\u2019t know he knew any muggleborns. Kept that quiet from mummy.\u201d\n\u201cMy dad was a wizard,\u201d Remus said, with some confidence, \u201cBut he died.\u201d\n\u201cHalf-blood.\u201d She murmured. \u201cBut even so\u2026\u201d She trailed off, despondently. Remus shifted uncomfortably; his bare feet were beginning to get cold on the bathroom tiles, and he was only wearing his underwear and a vest to sleep in, which was embarrassing enough. She didn\u2019t seem to mind, \u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d she said, \u201cNot having to grow up with all of this shit.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean magic?\u201d Remus frowned. He\u2019d never heard a witch or wizard \u2013 pureblood or muggleborn \u2013 talk this way.\n\u201cYeah, magic,\u201d she sniffed, \u201cWhat\u2019s so bloody good about magic, eh? What makes us so special? D\u2019you want to know a secret?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t, but thought it better not to say so. She carried on anyway, whispering now, \u201cI wish I was a muggle, sometimes,\u201d she said, a glimmer of madness in her eye, \u201cIf I could do it, I\u2019d run away forever and never be found. And I\u2019d have a nice normal job, and a nice normal life, and I\u2019d fall in love with whoever I want.\u201d At this last affirmation, she burst into tears.\n\u201cYou could do that anyway, if you wanted.\u201d Remus said, quickly, not sure exactly\nwhy\nhe was saying what he was saying. She looked at him suspiciously,\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s stopping you?\u201d He asked. \u201cYou\u2019re of age. You can do whatever you feel like. Go and be a waitress, or run away to America and be a film star. Marry Prince Charles if you want to. I mean\u2026 you might need to use a bit of magic to get started, but you could give it up. No one says you\nhave\nto do magic.\u201d\nShe stared at him, and looked him up and down,\n\u201cNo one\u2019s ever said that to me that before.\u201d\nRemus shrugged.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, again?\u201d\n\u201cRemus. Remus Lupin.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d She burst out laughing, \u201cYou poor thing, that\u2019s almost as a bad as Philomena!\u201d"

            "content": "Christmas Day, 1973\nRemus\u2019s odd late night conversation with Philomena had caused him to re-evaluate his anxieties about girlfriends. His ability to comfort her had stirred no particular feelings of chivalry or affection \u2013 only a mild sense of relief that he\u2019d got her to stop crying. He definitely had no desire to get that close to any other girl.\nHe thought about Narcissa for the first time in a while. Remus had secretly thought Narcissa was the most beautiful girl he knew \u2013 before she\u2019d dyed her hair anyway. She had a regal sharpness which appealed to him on some base level. But even she was made foolish by love \u2013 risking her own life, in fact.\nThe sight of Philomena sobbing in her nightie only cemented in Remus\u2019s mind the revelation that love and relationships were not worth the misery. He had enough pain in his life. Let Sirius and James work it out for themselves, but for the time being, Remus felt very intelligent for having come to this realisation so early in life. He had probably saved himself a lot of needless stress.\nChristmas morning was as wonderful as it had been the year before \u2013 even Philomena perked up once she saw the gifts under the tree with her name on them. Remus was able to enjoy the immense satisfaction of handing out his own presents, and Sirius and the Potters were all suitably pleased and thanked him profusely. He himself received a chess set from the Potters, which was perhaps the most expensive thing Remus had ever owned \u2013 and bought just for him, not second hand. Along with the usual assortment sweets and practical jokes from the marauders, it was a very good haul.\nSirius looked a bit nonplussed at breakfast, as everyone else wolfed down their smoked salmon and scrambled eggs.\n\u201cS\u2019up wif yoo?\u201d James asked, mouth full. Sirius shrugged,\n\u201cNothing from Andromeda,\u201d he said, quietly, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get presents or anything, now she\u2019s got the baby, but I thought maybe a card\u2026 I sent her one.\u201d\nJames swallowed and patted his friend\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cOwl might just be flying late \u2013 you know how the post is this time of year.\u201d\nJames had received a brand new broom for Christmas, and as soon as breakfast was finished with, all three boys headed straight outside to test it. Sirius had his own broom with him, and Mr Potter suggested with an arched eyebrow that Remus take James\u2019s old one.\n\u201cYeah, have it if you want, Moony!\u201d James nodded enthusiastically, \u201cTo keep!\u201d\n\u201cThanks\u2026\u201d Remus took it, unable to say no in front of James\u2019s parents. Goodness knew what he was supposed to do with it over the summer \u2013 try explaining that one to Matron.\nJames and Sirius spent the rest of the morning showing off, and Remus spent it hovering; just skimming the ground with his toes, trying to read his book and look like he was enjoying the broom. He hoped Peter had received his gifts from them, and wasn\u2019t having too bad of a time with his own family.\nThey were called in by the Potter\u2019s house elf, Gully, who was dressed in a festive tea towel and had a sprig of holly tucked behind one ear. It was almost lunch time, and the house smelled deliciously of roast beef with all the trimmings.\n\u201cUpstairs, washed and changed, the lot of you.\u201d Mrs Potter shook her wooden spoon at them, \u201cI\u2019ve had Gully set your things out.\u201d\nThey washed and dressed quickly, stomachs growling as the wonderful smells from the kitchen wafted up the stairs. Just as they began to make their way down, there was the tell-tale CRACK of apparition outside the front door. Sirius tensed again, and Remus, one step behind him on the staircase, gripped his shoulder in a way that he hoped was comforting.\nSirius turned around and looked Remus in the eye, giving him a gentle smile of appreciation. It was quite un-Sirius-like, but it felt good.\nThe bell rang and they both turned back to it, James running forward to open the door. A couple stood in the entrance way \u2013 a young man and a woman holding a bundle in her arms. He had a mop of fair, curly hair, and was rather stockily built, she was taller and more slender. As they stepped into the light of the hallway, Remus sucked in his breath \u2013 she was the spitting image of Sirius\u2019s cousin Bellatrix.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Sirius gasped, starting forward, a smile bursting on his face.\n\u201cSirius!\u201d The young woman grinned back, and Remus relaxed, seeing that it was not Bellatrix at all. This woman had the same wildly curly hair as her sister, though it was a much lighter shade of brown \u2013 it had to be Andromeda.\nShe passed the baby in her arms over to the man next to her \u2013 presumably her husband, Ted \u2013 and stretched out her arms to pull Sirius into a huge hug. Remus watched with fierce jealousy, and not a little guilt \u2013 he had never seen Sirius so embraced by anyone, let alone a member of his family. Remus made his own way slowly down the stairs, as Mrs Potter entered the hallway now, smiling widely, looking very pleased with herself.\n\u201cA good surprise, then?\u201d She asked, as Sirius shook Ted\u2019s hand and tentatively patted the baby\u2019s head.\n\u201cYou did this?!\u201d Sirius stared at James\u2019s mother in wonder.\n\u201cEffie was kind enough to invite us,\u201d Ted smiled, his eyes twinkling. \u201cPleased to meet you, Sirius. Nice to meet\nsomeone\nin Dromeda\u2019s family.\u201d\n\u201cCome in, come in!\u201d Mrs Potter ushered the gathering into the hall. They all followed her towards the dining room, Remus last of all.\n* * *\nAndromeda was the polar opposite to the rest of the Black family \u2013 or at least those Remus had so far met. Though she was as strikingly beautiful as the rest of them, with the same piercing eyes and biting wit, she was full of laughter and merriment. Ted clearly adored her too, and hardly seemed to mind that she left him with the baby most of the time.\n\u2018Dora\u2019 was the strangest infant Remus had ever seen \u2013 though, admittedly, he had not met many. She was as cheerful as her mother, with a gummy grin. Her wisps of hair changed from purple to green to blue with each moment, which everyone else seemed to find cute, rather than bizarre.\nBefore sitting down to eat, they were joined by several other guests \u2013 old family friends of the Potters, including, much to Remus\u2019s excitement, old Darius Barebones.\n\u201cA toast,\u201d Mr Potter raised his glass rather tipsily at the end of the meal, \u201cTo friends, old and new!\u201d\n\u201cTo the Potters!\u201d Andromeda raised her own glass, \u201cProtectors of outcasts and defenders of black sheep everywhere.\u201d\nEveryone laughed and clinked glasses.\n\u201cI think I must be the\nmost\noutcast,\u201d Sirius said, happily, \u201cI\u2019m a Gryffindor, after all.\u201d\n\u201cTo Gryffindor!\u201d Mr Potter called out, from the other end of the table. Only the Gryffindors toasted, Andromeda narrowed her eyes at Sirius,\n\u201cThink so, little cousin? Try marrying a non-relative.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to,\u201d Sirius responded, as Gully cleared away the plates and Mrs Potter fetched in the Christmas pudding, \u201cAfter Cissy\u2019s wedding there aren\u2019t any Black women left.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s Dora.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Ted said, protectively covering his daughter\u2019s ears, \u201cCould we please get her through her first Christmas before arranging a betrothal?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m teasing,\u201d Andromeda leaned over to kiss them both, \u201cDora can marry anyone she likes when she\u2019s old enough, and I can say with absolute certainty that it won\u2019t be anyone at this table.\u201d\nEveryone laughed again. Remus eyed Darius, furtively \u2013 he was looking just as merry as Mr Potter, his face glowing red from the fire whisky he\u2019d been knocking back.\nOnce the pudding was extinguished, served and eaten, crackers pulled and terrible jokes read out, the party adjourned to the living room. Mrs Potter, Philomena and Andromeda went upstairs to change into their party dresses, Mr Potter smoked his pipe and Ted settled Dora down for a nap. The boys settled into a game of snap, before Darius and Mr Potter wrangled everyone into a round of charades. Remus had never played charades before, let alone magical charades, which involved a lot of red and gold sparks \u2013 though that may just have been high spirits.\nIn the evening, more guests began to arrive and the house was soon full of music, laughter and pleasant chatter. Andromeda and Sirius appointed themselves DJs, rifling through their combined record collections and alternating blasting Slade\u2019s\nMerry Xmas Everybody\nand\nI Wish It Could be Christmas Everyday\nby Wizzard.\nWhen the snowman brings the snow\nWell he just might like to know\nHe's put a great big smile on somebody's face\u2026\n\u201cThey\u2019re actually\ncalled\nwizard, though,\u201d Sirius kept telling everyone, earnestly, \u201cAnd just\nlisten\nto it\u2026\u201d\nEven Philomena forgot her melancholy for a few hours, getting up and moving to the music along with James, who was just about the same height as her and had no clue how to dance, but was pretty chuffed when she took his hand and showed him how to twist.\nQuite sure he would not be missed, Remus slipped between the throngs of people in search of Darius. There must have been a hundred witches and wizards in attendance \u2013 some of them teachers at Hogwarts, who Remus did everything to avoid. He heard at least three people murmur that Dumbledore was there, somewhere.\n\u201cThey\u2019re both Black\u2019s, you know,\u201d he heard one witch whispering to her friend, as they watched Andromeda and Sirius giggling hysterically by the record player, \u201cShe\u2019s run off and had a baby with that Tonks chap, and the boy \u2013 well he\nwas\nthe heir, but I\u2019ve heard Orion is planning to contest it as soon as their younger boy is of age. Quite the little hell raiser, from what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d\n\u201cHe can\u2019t be any worse than Orion was, I went to school with him. Nasty, vicious kid. Sirius is a ray of sunshine compared to Orion \u2013 and don\u2019t get me started on that bitch Walpurga.\u201d\n\u201cShh.\u201d The first witch said, nervously, \u201cYou never know who\u2019s listening these days, even at the Potters.\u201d\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s he doing here at all, I\u2019d like to know?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s chums with the Potter boy. You know what Effie and Monty are like \u2013 they\u2019ve taken in the Pettigrew\u2019s eldest, too, she\u2019s over there.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I heard about that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s no secret at all why\nshe\u2019s\nhere \u2013 the Pettigrews and the Potters are both pure blood, after all, despite the rumours. Mind you, Effie might want to act quickly \u2013 if Philomena sees her chance to bag the Black heir then poor James isn\u2019t going to get a look in, is he? I mean, everybody knows what\u2019s going on; we all need to pick a side. The Potters picked theirs a long time ago, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\nRemus felt his blood boil. It was horrible, hearing his friends spoken about like that \u2013 and the Potters, who Remus was absolutely certain had no ulterior motives when it came to their son,\nor\nthe company he kept. They let James be friends with\nhim\n, after all, knowing exactly what he was.\nHe clenched his fists, wished he was allowed to do magic \u2013 do\nanything\nto shut those mean old bitches up. Sirius and Andromeda were now bawling at the tops of their lungs, joined by James and Philomena:\n\u201cWeeeell I wish it could be Christmas every daaaa-aaay!\nWhen the kids start singing and the band begins to plaa-aay\nOooooh I wish it could be Christmas everyday\nSo let the BELLS ring OUT for CHRISTmaaaas!\u201d\nRemus smiled, and at the same moment, finally caught sight of Darius. The old man was steaming drunk now, leaning heavily on the bannister in the hallway and talking to an old woman who looked like she would very much like to get away from him.\nRemus straightened his back and consciously smoothed his features. He\u2019d borrowed a set of James\u2019s smart dress robes for the occasion, and Philomena had kindly performed a cosmetic spell on his scars. As such, he hoped that he\u2019d get away with at least appearing to be the son of a famous wizard, rather than a muggle brat from a children\u2019s home.\n\u201cGood evening, Mr Barebones,\u201d he said, affecting an accent learnt from three years of listening to James and Sirius\u2019s received pronunciation. He held out a hand to the old man, who shook it, looking at him, puzzled, \u201cRemus Lupin \u2013 you remember we met last year?\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes! The Lupin boy!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Remus nodded, smiling serenely, keeping his expression controlled. He handed Darius another whisky, as the witch the old man had previously been talking to snuck away. \u201cI believe you knew my father?\u201d\n\u201cLyall Lupin! Best dueller I ever knew! Married a muggle somewhere in Wales, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Remus said, steadily, \u201cMy mother.\u201d He took a careful breath as Darius guzzled more whisky, then cleared his throat, \u201cDid you know Lyall very well?\u201d He found that \u2018Lyall\u2019 was much easier to say than \u2018my father\u2019.\n\u201cOh, quite well, quite well,\u201d Darius nodded enthusiastically, thrilled to have someone to talk to, \u201cWorked under him at the ministry, before all the trouble started. Never knew anyone better with boggarts \u2013 or dementors, come to that. The Azkaban liaison office has missed him, I can tell you.\u201d\n\u201cThe trouble?\u201d Remus asked, swiping another glass of whisky from Gully, who hurried past with a tray, and handing it to the old man.\n\u201cThank you, dear boy. Yes, the trouble. Nasty business. Nasty.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about\u2026 the events that led to Lyall\u2019s suicide?\u201d He couldn\u2019t say it. Darius had to say it.\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about the damned werewolves!\u201d Darius slammed his empty whisky glass down on a nearby sideboard. \u201cForgive me,\u201d he muttered.\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d Remus replied, unblinking. \u201cDo go on. I know the story, of course. But I\u2019d like to\u2026 hear about it from someone who knew him.\u201d\nDarius surveyed him, carefully, through his whisky-addled haze. He seemed to slump, slightly, before beginning his story.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t possibly know, you understand, none of us\u2026 well\u2026 Lyall was a great wizard \u2013 a\ngreat\nwizard, you hear me?\u201d He slurred. Remus nodded. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d the old man looked upwards, glassy eyed, \u201cWell, he did have a tendency to obsess over things. And that temper! Flew into rages at work \u2013 during committee hearings, even.\u201d\n\u201cCommittee hearings?\u201d Remus almost broke character.\n\u201cHasn\u2019t your mother told you?\u201d Darius looked at him, surprised, \u201cBloody muggles, not fit to raise our children, I\u2019ve said it for years...\u201d He sighed, \u201cYour father was on several committees at the ministry for the regulation and control of magical creatures.\u201d\nRemus was glad he had taken Care of Magical Creatures, otherwise he might know nothing at all about this. As it was, he was able to nod, knowingly. Darius continued,\n\u201cJust his area, of course, he was a giant in the field. But he liked his own way, and he was seen as a bit of an extremist, in those days. Wanted an overhaul of the Werewolf Registry, better identification and tracking measures. We just didn\u2019t have the manpower for it, and resources were better spent elsewhere. And Lupin\u2026 he\u2019d been working with dark creatures for so many years, he thought he saw werewolves everywhere \u2013 always saw danger where there clearly wasn\u2019t any. Honestly, we all thought he was an eccentric, we couldn\u2019t have known\u2026 when they brought Greyback in, I was there. I saw him, and I don\u2019t mind telling you,\nnone\nof us thought he was a threat. Clearly drunk. Confused. A vagrant, that\u2019s what we thought. And when Lupin went off on one of his rants about werewolves, well\u2026 we didn\u2019t think twice.\u201d\n\u201cYou let Greyback go.\u201d Remus said, stonily. Darius looked very sorry for himself now, almost weepy. He nodded.\n\u201cWe let him go. Of course now, now we know\u2026 if only we\u2019d listened. Lyall killed himself just after that, didn\u2019t even want to hear the committee\u2019s apology.\u201d He sighed, and looked at Remus again, \u201cI\u2019ve always wondered what drove him to it, you know. Some say it was the guilt \u2013 not being able to stop Greyback. I wouldn\u2019t have thought he was the type\u2026 and to abandon his family like that, I mean, you couldn\u2019t have been much more than a baby?\u201d\n\u201cFive.\u201d Remus said, \u201cI was five.\u201d\n\u201cYes, well.\u201d Darius shifted, uncomfortably, looking morosely down at his empty glass, \u201cI have my own little theory about what happened\u2026 what if Greyback came after him, eh? We know how dangerous he is, now. We know he hates wizards more than anything else, and your father said some very unpleasant things. So what I wonder is\u2026 did Greyback go back and get him? Did he bite him? If that\u2019s what happened then\u2026 I must say, I don\u2019t blame Lyall at all. Only good beast\u2019s a dead beast.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d Remus replied, feeling very hot, and a bit dizzy. \u201cAnd Greyback?\u201d\n\u201cLast I heard, he\u2019s in league with you-know-who.\u201d Darius shook his head, \u201cAnd the damned irony of it all is that we need your father more than ever. Still,\u201d he smiled at Remus, kindly, \u201cDon\u2019t think he died in vain, dear boy. We did end up implementing a lot of his reforms, particularly where half-breeds are concerned. Can\u2019t escape the registry now, no sir!\u201d He slammed his wizened old fist down.\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Remus turned, quickly. He had heard enough. \u201cI hear Mrs Potter calling.\u201d\nHe slipped back into the crowd of merrymakers, the music still blaring as Sirius and Andromeda led everyone in chorus:\n\u201cSo here it iiiiiiiis, Merry Christmas,\nEverybody's having fuuuuun!\nLoo-ook to the future now,\nIt's only just begun!\u201d"

            "content": "Saturday 5\nth\nJanuary 1974\nSheets of rain battered against the Hogwarts Express like a volley of enemy arrows, covering the usually green hillsides in a gauzy veil of mist and drizzle, darkening the sky.\n\u201cFeels rubbish going back to school, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Sirius said sulkily, glaring out of the window.\nRemus glanced over at Peter, who was staring at Sirius in disbelief. Sirius didn\u2019t notice. Remus sighed,\n\u201cHow was your Christmas, Pete?\u201d He asked politely.\n\u201cOk.\u201d Peter replied, dully, \u201cThanks for the sweets.\u201d\n\u201cSeen my broom?\u201d James asked, pulling it down from the luggage rack. Peter got up to look, perking up a bit. Remus rolled his eyes and returned to his book.\nHe wasn\u2019t really reading it. He hadn\u2019t been able to concentrate properly on a book since the Potter\u2019s Christmas party. In fact, he hadn\u2019t been able to concentrate on anything at all. Not flying, or games, or conversations, or James and Sirius\u2019s animagus planning. So he pretended to read, hoping they\u2019d leave him to it. At St Edmund\u2019s he might have just skulked off by himself into town, but that didn\u2019t seem like a very good way to show gratitude to James\u2019s parents, who were sure to worry.\nIt was as if there was a list of questions in his head that he had no way of getting the answers to, so they just played on repeat, around and around. Where was Greyback now? Who was \u2018you know who\u2019? Had Lyall Lupin hated his son that much?\nRemus had already known that his father had killed himself because he\u2019d been bitten. He\u2019d always assumed that Lyall had been motivated by guilt. But now\u2026 well, what Remus had been wrong? What if the real reason had been hatred \u2013 or even worse \u2013 shame?\nFor the past three years, Remus had been working hard at school, using his father\u2019s wand and taking the subjects his father might have taken. He didn\u2019t think about Lyall\nall\nthe time, but in the back of his mind, it had still meant something. Since the Christmas party, he wasn\u2019t so sure any more. Ferox had said \u2018know thyself\u2019, but Remus was failing to see the wisdom in that now. He\u2019d been much happier not knowing.\nThese dark thoughts were interrupted by a quiet tapping at the carriage door. Marlene poked her head around,\n\u201cHiya McKinnon,\u201d James grinned, \u201cEvans with you?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 no.\u201d She squeaked, fiddling with her hair nervously, \u201cSirius, can I talk to you?\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d Sirius sat up, looking confused, \u201cEr\u2026 what is it?\u201d\n\u201cMary um\u2026 Mary asked me to tell you something.\u201d\n\u201cTell me what?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t think I was supposed to say it in front of this lot.\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 ok\u2026\u201d Sirius got up and followed her outside into the corridor. The other three exchanged amused looks while they waited.\nUgh\n, Remus thought, had he been mistaken about the Mary and Sirius thing?! Was it Sirius and\nMarlene\n, now?\nMoments later, a stunned looking Sirius re-entered the compartment alone.\n\u201cWell?\u201d James asked.\n\u201cMary\u2019s got a boyfriend, apparently.\u201d Sirius said, confused.\n\u201cYou mean\u2026 you got dumped?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno.\u201d He sat down, scratching his head, \u201cWas I going out with her?\u201d\n\u201cWell, apparently she thought you were.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t girls just say what they mean?!\u201d Sirius ran his hand through his hair in a good imitation of James, who nodded in a sympathetic way.\n\u201cGirls are a nightmare.\u201d He agreed.\nRemus celebrated, inwardly. Thank goodness all of that was behind them.\n* * *\nSunday 6\nth\nJanuary 1974\nHe later learnt that Mary had started going out with a muggle boy she knew from home.\n\u201cWe grew up in the same block,\u201d she confided in him, excitedly, \u201cHis flat\u2019s just across from mine. I properly fancied Sirius, and he\u2019s nice and everything, but\u2026 well he\u2019s a bit posh. I don\u2019t think he even knows what a council flat is.\u201d\nRemus had to agree on that one.\nAs for himself, he warmed to Mary once again, and didn\u2019t even mind her going on and on about her new boyfriend, and how he\u2019d taken her to the local dance hall, and the pictures, and how her mum loved him, and her dad thought he was a \u2018good boy\u2019. Marlene, however, looked terminally bored as they sat around by the fire doing their last bits of holiday homework together.\nThis did not escape Mary\u2019s notice.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be jealous, Marls.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Marlene frowned. \u201cI just think you\u2019re being horrible to Sirius.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cDumping him like that! You\u2026 you hurt his feelings!\u201d Marlene\u2019s cheeks had turned an uncharacteristic shade of pink.\n\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t,\u201d Remus snorted.\nBoth girls glared at him, as if he had completely misunderstood.\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d Mary stared at her friend, \u201cMarlene, do\nyou\nfancy Sirius?!\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Marlene stood up, bright red now, \u201cOh, you\u2019re such a bitch, Mary!\u201d She stormed up to the girls dorm. Lily sighed, glancing up,\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t very nice.\u201d She said, reproachfully.\n\u201cHer problem, not mine.\u201d Mary shrugged. \u201c\nDoes\nshe fancy Sirius?!\u201d\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going too.\u201d Remus stood up, trying not to heave a sigh.\n\u201cOh no, don\u2019t go, Remus!\u201d Mary said, \u201cWe\u2019ll stop talking about boys, I promise.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d he lied, \u201cAnd I\u2019ve finished mine. See you tomorrow.\u201d\nAs he walked away, he heard Mary whisper, very loudly,\n\u201cOh my god, maybe he fancies Marls!\u201d\nRemus reminded himself that he was trying to like Mary again, and didn\u2019t react. He climbed the stairs and went to sit in the dorm room alone. James, Peter and Sirius were all in detention for a prank they had pulled before Christmas.\nHe wasn\u2019t tired at all. It was two nights before the full moon, and he was beginning to feel the usual tell-tale restlessness in his limbs, the familiar quickening of his heartbeat. Left to his own devices, Remus returned to the troubling thoughts that had been bothering him for weeks. Again, they seemed to just swirl through his brain in a big soupy mess, without beginning or end.\nDid all wizards feel the same way as Darius? As Lyall Lupin? Were his father\u2019s actions really justifiable? Remus couldn\u2019t ignore the fact that his mother had also abandoned him \u2013 which had to mean something. His friends certainly hadn\u2019t treated him any differently after finding out\u2026 but then how could anyone\ntruly\nknow what their friends thought of them? The marauders liked anything dangerous; perhaps sharing a room with Remus was simply another exciting risk.\nWhat he really needed was to speak to somebody impartial. James was so lucky, having two parents always willing to listen. Sirius was lucky to have James. Remus wasn\u2019t sure if Peter had problems or not. Probably did. Probably told James too.\nThere was McGonagall, Remus knew that they were supposed to go to her with their problems. But she was so stern and difficult, and she liked James best anyway. Madam Pomfrey of course; she\u2019d been supportive before. But she wasn\u2019t one to let you feel sorry for yourself; she\u2019d just try to come up with a common-sense solution, or else tell him not to worry so much. Then Dumbledore \u2013 but Remus had no idea how to talk to him, and he wasn\u2019t even sure he wanted to.\nAs far as people who knew the complexities of Remus\u2019s problem, there was also Professor Ferox \u2013 Remus was ninety-five percent sure he knew, anyway. He pondered this as an option.\nRemus felt a sort of unidentifiable kinship with his Care of Magical Creatures professor. He had a very reassuring presence, and Remus thought he might feel better if he could speak to him, somehow sure that Ferox would lend a sympathetic ear. There was a funny flutter in his stomach, like excitement, and Remus thought that was a good sign. He glanced at the clock in the corner. It was only five o\u2019clock, the other boys wouldn\u2019t be out of detention until six and curfew wasn\u2019t until eight.\nRemus pulled the marauder\u2019s map from under his pillow. The basic outline of the castle was complete, now; they just needed to finalise the grounds, animate the staircases and add the secret places that only they knew about. Then Sirius\u2019s tagging idea could come next, though they still weren\u2019t very sure how to go about it. Remus had discovered one spell that would locate a single person, but nothing of the magnitude they required.\nStill, he cast his locator spell now, and found that Professor Ferox was walking from the Great Hall to the staff room. Remus got up, quickly \u2013 if he was fast, then he could make it look like a chance encounter. He grabbed James\u2019s cloak before leaving, just in case Mary and Lily were still in the common room.\nHe was just reaching for the door knob when he had a sudden flash of sense.\nWhat on earth was he doing? Going to see Professor Ferox \u2013 and then what? Whinge to him about his dead father? Cry to him about how nobody would ever understand him, because he was a murderous dark creature with a working-class accent? Moan about how his friends were all going girl mad, and he felt left behind?\nRemus retreated back into the room.\nWhat on earth would Ferox think of him? That he was a big wuss, that\u2019s what. You couldn\u2019t just go crying to teachers whenever something bothered you; you couldn\u2019t just expect everyone to feel sorry for you.\nNo one owes you a happy life\n, Matron always said.\nHe lay on his bed and stared up at the canopy. He felt worse, now. He didn\u2019t know what had come over him \u2013 he was never normally one to act on impulse \u2013 not anymore, not since his first year. He\u2019d just felt so strongly that he ought to see his teacher. Ah! There it was again, that flutter in his midsection. It wasn\u2019t excitement at all \u2013 it was\u2026 well, he wasn\u2019t sure yet what it was. He felt hot and flushed and oddly prickly. It was something\u2026 animal.\nOh god. Remus let out a groan. It must be the transformation. The wolf was creeping in earlier than usual, maybe. It probably liked the smell of Ferox, or it caught the scent of his kneazle. Did wolves eat cats?\nOnly good beast\u2019s a dead beast.\nThat\u2019s what Darius told him. At the time, Remus had felt it was a little unfair\u2026 after all, he\u2019d never actually hurt anyone. Dumbledore wouldn\u2019t let that happen. He definitely didn\u2019t\nwant\nto hurt anyone, either, except occasionally Snape, and that was just\nnormal\n, wasn\u2019t it?\nPerhaps Remus was more dangerous than he thought he was.\u00a0 He\u2019d learnt to control his temper most of the time now, he\u2019d learnt to control his magic. He just had to learn to control whatever this was, too.\nWhen James, Sirius and Peter returned, Remus had made up his mind.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a think,\u201d he started,\n\u201cNo wonder you needed a lie down,\u201d Sirius smirked. Remus threw a pillow at him.\n\u201cPiss off, I\u2019m serious.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\nI\u2019m\nSiri-\u201d\nJames slapped him around the head,\n\u201cShut up, Black.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Remus smiled. \u201cEr\u2026 the whole animagus thing.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Sirius looked eager now, still rubbing his head, \u201cHad an idea? I\nlove\nMoony ideas!\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 not exactly,\u201d Remus felt awkward now. Still, it had to be done. He\u2019d made a decision. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t want you to do it.\u201d\n\u201cDo what?\u201d Peter looked confused.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want us to become animagi.\u201d James said, looking at Remus with those clear, honest eyes. \u201cIs that right?\u201d\nRemus nodded, feeling horribly guilty.\n\u201cI\u2019m really grateful, I am. I just\u2026 I don\u2019t think any of you really understand how dangerous it would be. I could hurt you. I could\u2026 I could kill you. I\u2019ve got no control over it.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s going to work!\u201d Sirius protested, \u201cI did all the research, James, did you show him?\u201d\n\u201cLeave it, mate,\u201d James said, \u201cIt\u2019s Lupin\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Remus smiled at James. He felt terrible for letting them down \u2013 but it was for their own good, and he had to be the mature one.\nSirius looked like he wanted to say something else, but James gave him a hard look that was so like Mrs Potter that it silenced the shorter boy at once. They didn\u2019t say much for the rest of the evening, and Remus had to pretend to read his book again.\nLater that night, after lights out, Remus heard Sirius creep over to James\u2019s bed and cast the silencing spell for the first time in a long time. He wished they would invite him, just once. He wished he wasn\u2019t always the one left out, he wished he knew how it felt to have a friend as close as James. More than ever, he wanted someone to talk to.\nSuddenly overwhelmed, Remus quickly cast his own spell, so the others wouldn\u2019t hear him crying."

Unfortunately, McGonagall was wise to their antics this year and had a prefect watching the boys\u2019 dorms to prevent any further midnight firework displays.\nFortunately, Remus\u2019s fourteenth fell on a Hogsmeade weekend, and he felt very grown up indeed spending the afternoon in The Three Broomsticks with his friends. It soon became clear that James and Sirius had somehow bribed all of their classmates to stop by the pub too, as a steady stream of students approached their table wanting to buy Remus a butterbeer or toast his health. By the time the afternoon was over everyone in the bar knew Remus\u2019s name, and he was raucously cheered on his way out. Completely embarrassing, of course.\nWith his birthday out of the way, Remus threw himself into revision in preparation for the upcoming exams \u2013 he had a particular urge to do well in his new subjects, not least Care of Magical Creatures. By returning his focus to study and schoolwork, Remus slowly began to put the cruel words of Darius Barebones behind him. Yes, he was dangerous, and yes, once everyone found out what Remus was he would very likely be shunned. But until then, he had an opportunity to learn \u2013 and he wasn\u2019t going to waste it.\n* * *\nSunday 7\nth\nApril 1974\nRemus had never met Davey Gudgeon before \u2013 as far as he knew, nor had any of the others. He never found out what the kid looked like, even. But he would remember that name until the day he died.\nThe whomping willow had been turned into a game during the summer of 1973 by a group of bored first years, and though it was abhorred by Filch and frowned upon by the heads of houses, no one had really said anything about it. Try to see how close you can get to the trunk before the branches took a swipe at you. Remus certainly had no inclination to play. He hated that tree.\nAs it was, Remus wasn\u2019t even there when it happened. It was the day after a full moon, and he was in the hospital wing, as per usual. Peter was sitting on the floor, sorting through his chocolate frog cards, murmuring to himself happily. James was marking Sirius\u2019s divination homework, and Sirius was covertly flicking his wand at James behind his back, turning his hair different colours for Remus\u2019s amusement. Blue, pink, green, yellow \u2013 it was working too; Remus found it hysterically funny, because James looked so serious, and when he was concentrating his tongue poked out between his teeth like a cat.\nIt was a perfectly pleasant afternoon, and Remus could almost ignore how much his bones and teeth hurt as they settled back into place for another cycle.\nBut then it happened. The hospital door slammed open, and a student came in shrieking;\n\u201cMadam Pomfrey! Madam Pomfrey! Help!\u201d\nNosey as they were, Sirius and James jumped down from the bed to peer around the pale green curtains. Remus sighed, leaning back on his pillow. He was accustomed now to the ebb and flow of the hospital wing; raised voices like that usually meant a spell gone wrong. He tried to ignore it \u2013 he resented anything that reminded him he was in a hospital, and not just enjoying a lazy afternoon with his friends.\nBut James and Sirius remained out of view, watching whatever the scene was unfold, and when they turned back towards the bed their faces were pale and serious. The commotion had grown louder, Remus was dimly aware of someone crying.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d He asked, more irritably than he meant to.\nSirius\u2019s mouth twisted and James shook his head, mutely, pushing his glasses up his nose. Peter finally looked up from his cards,\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cAn accident... some kid.\u201d James murmured.\n\u201cEveryone out!\u201d Madam Pomfrey\u2019s voice echoed through the chamber, unnaturally loud and clear. The curtain around Remus\u2019s bed parted and she poked her head through, looking distracted, \u201cRemus, dear, if you\u2019re feeling well enough it might be best for you to spend the rest of the afternoon in your own bed. Potter, would you go and fetch Professor Sprout? Tell her that one of her students has been injured.\u201d\nJames nodded and left immediately, without even glancing back at his friends or his homework. You could always rely on James.\nSirius caught Remus\u2019s eye and Remus nodded his assent, climbing out of bed. He was still in his pyjamas, and Sirius hoiked Peter up by the elbow to give him some privacy. Remus dressed as quickly as he could, shoved his books into his bag, grabbed James\u2019s work and joined his friends on the other side of the curtain. He could smell blood.\nCurtains had been drawn around the bed nearest the door, and the three boys hurried past it, wanting nothing more than to escape the unpleasant atmosphere and get as far away as possible. They went straight to the common room, Remus limping slightly, Sirius and Peter slowing down to match his pace.\n\u201cWhat was it?\u201d Remus whispered, \u201cThere was blood.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius replied, looking shaken, \u201cI dunno what happened but\u2026 it was his face.\u201d\nPeter looked faintly ill.\nThey reached the common room and Remus collapsed into an armchair, exhausted.\n\u201cYou ok?\u201d Sirius asked, anxiously, touching a hand to Remus\u2019s shoulder. Remus nodded, closing his eyes and breathing deeply,\n\u201cFine, fine.\u201d He shrugged Sirius off, embarrassed, wishing he could be normal for once.\n\u201cAlright lads,\u201d Mary sauntered into the room, Marlene in tow, \u201cHear what happened to that Gudgeon kid?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sirius replied, slyly, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWhacked in the face by that mental tree.\u201d She said, shaking her cloak off, \u201cThey were trying to touch the trunk.\u201d\n\u201cThe whomping willow?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Marlene piped up, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be allowed! It\u2019s so dangerous!\u201d\n\u201cDid you see it happen?!\u201d Remus asked, trying to keep the panic out of his voice.\n\u201cNope,\u201d Mary shrugged, flinging herself down on the couch next to Sirius, \u201cHeard it from one of the second-year girls.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have to get rid of it!\u201d Marlene said, shrilly. \u201cDumbledore can\u2019t leave it there now. Someone could be killed.\u201d\n\u201cHe should have stayed away from it.\u201d Sirius said, frowning, \u201cIt\u2019s a stupid game. Everyone knows what that tree\u2019s like.\u201d\n\u201cHave I gone mad?\u201d Mary laughed, \u201cSirius Black, the voice of reason?!\u201d\n\u201cPiss off,\u00a0MacDonald,\u201d Sirius scowled.\nRemus was starting to get a headache. He rubbed his temple and closed his eyes again, shrinking down into the armchair. Guilt creeped up his spine, hot and cold pinpricks. It hit him in the\nface\n?! Would this Gudgeon boy be ok? Surely Madam Pomfrey would be able to fix it, whatever it was. She could fix anything.\n* * *\nGossip about Davey Gudgeon flooded the school in a matter of hours, until no one could escape it. Sarah Saunders from Ravenclaw told everyone that she\u2019d seen his parents arrive, then march straight to Dumbledore\u2019s office, looking furious. Gudgeon\u2019s friends in Hufflepuff relayed the story over and over for anyone who\u2019d listened \u2013 that it had seemed as though Davey would actually reach the trunk this time, but then the willow lashed out at the very last minute. They heard varying accounts of the damage \u2013 that the tree had cracked his skull in two, that he had lost both his eyes, or even that he had\nactually died\nand the school was covering it up.\nMarlene, who seemed more distressed than anyone else about the whole thing, enlisted Lily and Mary\u2019s help in drawing up a petition to have the whomping willow removed from the school premises. Remus signed it \u2013 he couldn\u2019t think of a good enough reason not to.\nSirius refused.\n\u201cThat tree has just as much right to be here as anybody.\u201d He said, firmly, as Marlene chased him with a quill.\n\u201cBut Sirius,\u201d she pleaded, \u201cIt\u2019s\ndangerous\n.\u201d\n\u201cSo are bludgers!\u201d He returned, dodging her, \u201cYou going to leave the quidditch team?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s hardly the same thing!\u201d\n\u201cUgh, just sign it, Black,\u201d Lily groaned, trying to finish her Runes homework, \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the principle!\u201d He crossed his arms, firmly. Lily rolled her huge green eyes.\n\u201cTosser.\u201d She muttered under her breath, \u201cCan\u2019t he see how upset Marls is?\u201d\n\u201cWhy\nis\nshe so upset?\u201d Remus asked, in a whisper, when Marlene was out of earshot. \u201cDid she know Davey?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t think so,\u201d Lily sighed, \u201cI think she just wants a project to take her mind off stuff at home. Family, you know.\u201d\nRemus thought about this. He didn\u2019t know Marlene as well as he\u2019d got to know Lily and Mary. Mary was so outgoing, and would chat to anyone. (In fact, if anything she was a bit of an oversharer. Remus knew far too much about her snogging preferences for his liking.) Marlene had always been the quieter, shyer one \u2013 less sure of herself, even in the areas she excelled. He didn\u2019t know very much about her family simply because it never occurred to him to ask about people\u2019s families.\nHe didn\u2019t think the petition would really go anywhere. Dumbledore had given a speech prohibiting anyone from going near the whomping willow again, and that was all that had been said on the matter. The staff were clearly uneasy, and Remus had just been trying to keep his head down.\nThe other marauders hadn\u2019t said anything to him about it, and changed the subject whenever it came up. Usually Remus preferred not to discuss anything related to his \u2018furry little problem\u2019, but now he was beginning to wonder whether they secretly blamed him after all. James would never say it out loud, of course \u2013 Peter might. Sirius might say so and then instantly take it back. Either way, none of them said a word, leaving Remus\u2019s imagination to run wild.\nA week after the incident, Professor Sprout confirmed the rumour; Davey Gudgeon was now blind, and would not be returning to Hogwarts for quite some time. Remus had been trying to avoid Sprout since it had happened \u2013 as Herbology teacher, he was sure that she knew exactly what the whomping willow was doing on the grounds in the first place.\n\u201cHis parents are taking him to America, where there are advances being made in ocular healing potions.\u201d The dumpy professor explained at breakfast. \u201cI am sure Davy and his family are very grateful for all of your well wishes.\u201d\nRemus felt a horrible sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. When Marlene, Lily, Mary, and a few other students got up to present their petition \u2013 which had over four hundred signatures, now, - Remus went with them.\nProfessor Sprout accepted the petition and promised to discuss the matter with Dumbledore. She even awarded Marlene ten house points for her efforts.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to get rid of it, though,\u201d Sirius said, later that evening when the marauders were all alone in their room.\n\u201cNo, I doubt it,\u201d Remus kicked a stray sock under his bed, hands in his pockets.\n\u201cSo why did you go up?\u201d\nRemus shrugged,\n\u201cFelt like the right thing to do. I mean. Marlene\u2019s right \u2013 the tree\u2019s dangerous. Shouldn\u2019t be at a school.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Peter started.\n\u201cI know.\u201d Remus snapped. \u201cI know, ok?\u201d\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t feel guilty, mate,\u201d James said, kindly, \u201cGudgeon shouldn\u2019t have been mucking around like that\u2026 it\u2019s not your fault\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s anyone\u2019s fault,\u201d Remus said darkly, \u201cThen it\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s stupid.\u201d Sirius said, bluntly, shaking his head, \u201cYou didn\u2019t plant it, did you? I dunno if it\u2019s escaped everyone else\u2019s attention, but this school is not exactly safety conscious. It\u2019s built next to a bloody forest full of creatures more dangerous than a flipping\ntree\n, there\u2019s supposed to be a\nliteral monster\nlying dormant somewhere directly below us, and \u2013 not being funny \u2013 but have you\nseen\nHagrid?!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your point, Black?\u201d Remus sighed, heavily, sitting down. His hip hurt if he stood up for too long. He was getting to be like an old woman.\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Sirius shrugged, \u201cShit happens? Don\u2019t blame yourself? Stop moping?\u201d\n\u201cMoping?!\u201d Remus growled, his temperature rising, \u201cFuck off. There\u2019s a kid who\ncan\u2019t see\nbecause I\u2019m too dangerous to be at school! Try telling Marlene what I am, I bet she\u2019d get a lot more signatures on THAT petition.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not dangerous!\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I am.\u201d Remus hissed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re our friend.\u201d James said, suddenly. Remus stared at him. It was a stupid, soppy, dramatic thing to say. But that was half of the problem with James \u2013 he so embodied those unrealistic values of loyalty, justice, and honour, that he forced you to believe in them too. He sat next to Remus on the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re our friend, and that\u2019s the most important thing, ok?\u201d\nHe met Remus\u2019s glare and stared back, smiling. \u201cOk?\u201d He said.\nRemus continued to glare, and James inched closer, so that their knees knocked together, \u201cOk?!\u201d He said, leaning forward now, his nose centimetres from Remus\u2019s. Remus knew this tactic \u2013 James did the same thing sometimes to cheer Sirius up. He never blinked \u2013 it was highly unnerving, and finally Remus laughed, ducking away,\n\u201cOk! Ok!\u201d\nJames laughed too and threw his arms around Remus,\n\u201cThank goodness! We couldn\u2019t lose you, Moony!\u201d He cried. Suddenly, Sirius and Peter followed suit, piling onto Remus, who found himself at the bottom of a very giggly scrum.\nLaughing, despite himself, Remus tried to squirm out from under them,\n\u201cGet off me you bunch of poofs!\u201d\n\u201cAhh, you love us really,\u201d Sirius patted his head."

            "content": "\u201cSo, summer?\u201d James asked, over butterbeers in the Three Broomsticks on their last Hogsmeade weekend before exams.\nSirius and Remus groaned in unison.\n\u201cYou\nknow\nI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Remus started,\n\u201cThey\u2019ll\nnever\nlet me.\u201d Sirius finished.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why, though,\u201d James replied, innocently. \u201cYou both came for Christmas.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but there\u2019s some rule about me staying at St Edmund\u2019s for the whole summer,\u201d Remus shrugged. \u201cWhile I\u2019m there, I have to follow muggle law. You don\u2019t get to visit anyone when you\u2019re in care, unless they\u2019re related.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you know what my lot are like.\u201d Sirius sighed, heavily. \u201cEven after Christmas \u2013 and I think that was just to keep me out of the way, to be honest. Reg already told me I\u2019m expected.\u201d\n\u201cWhen did you speak to Regulus?\u201d James looked up, surprised. Sirius shifted slightly on his stool, looking awkward,\n\u201cEr\u2026 the other day. Wasn\u2019t worth mentioning, only saw him for a minute.\u201d\n\u201c\nI\u2019ll\nbe there all summer, James,\u201d Peter said, loudly.\nSirius rolled his eyes rather obviously, but James smiled and patted Peter\u2019s knee,\n\u201cYeah, great, mate \u2013 least I\u2019ll have you, eh?\u201d\n\u201cI might be able to swing a Diagon Alley trip,\u201d Sirius said, perking up slightly, \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it, and if you brought the invisibility cloak then we\nmight\nbe able to work something out\u2026\u201d\nThe three of them began to chat excitedly about this plan \u2013 Remus let them. Ever since he\u2019d put a stop to the animagus initiative the marauders had been at a bit of a loose end. They needed something to use their creative energy on, and it generally had to be at least mildly illegal.\n\u201cMoony,\u201d James said suddenly, \u201cWhere is St. Edmund\u2019s, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cEpping Forest,\u201d Remus supplied, promptly, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cWe could always come and visit you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus said this with such forcefulness that Sirius and Peter\u2019s heads snapped up, alarmed. Remus swallowed dryly, \u201cJust don\u2019t, ok? It\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d\nHis insides churned \u2013 the humiliation he would feel when his friends saw how he lived; where he came from. It would be too much to bear. \u00a0What would they say when they saw his dull grey muggle clothes, or the other boys\u2019 rough faces and hard knuckles? The concrete blocks and the splintering portakabins and the scrubby patch of grass out front. They would pity him.\n\u201cI\u2019ll write,\u201d he said, hurriedly, hoping to allay them, \u201cAnd you lot can tell me everything you get up to. Hopefully I can come to yours again at Christmas, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cYou might not,\u201d Sirius said, suddenly, \u201cFull moon\u2019s on the twenty-ninth this December.\u201d\nRemus looked at him, oddly. He prided himself in having an excellent memory, but Sirius took the cake when it came to the moon cycles.\nJames laughed,\n\u201cHow come you\u2019ve memorised every bloody full moon until we\u2019re fifty, but you can\u2019t get above an \u2018Acceptable\u2019 in Astronomy?!\u201d\n\u201cSome things are important to remember, some things aren\u2019t,\u201d Sirius shrugged, draining his tankard, \u201cAnd messing up the constellations really annoys my parents. So.\u201d\n* * *\nMid-May, 1974\nRemus yawned and closed his book. He\u2019d done plenty. More than enough. Too much, if you were to ask Sirius. But then, it was all very well if you were lucky enough to have wealthy dead relatives. Someone with Remus\u2019s prospects couldn\u2019t afford to slack off.\nThe library was open for extended hours during the exam period, but even so, it was almost closing time, with only a few much older students left behind, blinking sleepily at their texts. Lily, Mary and Marlene had gone to bed at least an hour ago \u2013 or Remus thought so, anyway. The days had become very repetitive in the lead up to the end of term, and time no longer felt truly linear \u2013 he hadn\u2019t even been outside in days.\nWearily, he stood up, rubbing his eyes, and carried a pile of books back towards the Study of Magical Creatures shelves. He\u2019d found that he could stay on Pince\u2019s good side if he tidied up after himself, and it wasn\u2019t much effort.\nHe liked being in the library late \u2013 it was nice and quiet. Growing up in a boy\u2019s home and sharing a bedroom with the marauders had given Remus precious few opportunities for peace and quiet.\nAs he turned around the final row of stacks, he caught sight of a small figure slumped at the end, fast asleep over a little single desk. Tip-toeing forward, he recognised the fan of blonde hair splayed over the pages of an open book.\n\u201cMarlene,\u201d he whispered, as he got closer. \u201cMarlene!\u201d He tapped her shoulder gently.\nShe jumped violently, fast enough to give Remus whiplash, then stared about with confused, bleary eyes.\n\u201cRemus?\u201d\n\u201cYou fell asleep,\u201d he explained, keeping his voice low, \u201cLibrary\u2019s closing soon.\u201d\n\u201cOh no!\u201d She looked distraught, gazing down at her parchment, which was blank. She\u2019d smeared a bit of ink at the top, but nothing more. \u201cOh no.\u201d she said again, forlorn.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d Remus tried to cheer her up, \u201cYou obviously needed the rest, eh? Still some time before exams start.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got so much revision to do! I can\u2019t remember anything about crups, can you?\u201d\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Remus dodged the question, \u201cWe\u2019d better go, or Pince\u2019ll be after us.\u201d\nMarlene nodded dazedly and got up, letting him lead her out through the maze of bookshelves. As they left, she began muttering to herself,\n\u201cCrups have forked tails, are wary of muggles, and somewhat resemble cocker spaniels.\u201d\n\u201cJack Russell\u2019s.\u201d Remus corrected, without thinking.\n\u201cWhat? Really?! Are you sure??\u201d The girl grabbed his arm, unreasonably panicked by this information.\n\u201cEr\u2026 yeah,\u201d Remus said, reeling back, unable to get away from Marlene\u2019s vice-like grip.\n\u201cOf course you\u2019re sure!\u201d She said, woefully, finally letting him go, \u201cYou\u2019re the best in the class.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re very good too\u2026\u201d Remus began, but stopped. Marlene\u2019s face crumpled and she burst into tears.\n\u201cI can\u2019t do it! I\u2019m going to fail everything!\u201d She wailed, loudly.\nA group of Slytherin\u2019s passing by snickered at her, before Remus pointed his wand menacingly at them. Marlene, still weeping, threw herself at Remus, arms around his neck as she sobbed onto his shoulder. Taken aback, Remus tried to pat her, gently, as her tiny body shook against him. He\u2019d never been hugged by a girl before \u2013 except James\u2019s mum, and that was hardly the same thing. He didn\u2019t like it. His shoulder was getting wet.\nMarlene was completely oblivious to his awkwardness, however, \u201cI\u2019m so rubbish!\u201d She sniffed, \u201cI mess up everything, I\u2019m never going to be as good as Danny, or mum, or you, or Lily\u2026\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 you\u2019re better than Mary at\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut Mary\u2019s got a boyfriend and everyone fancies her and no one likes me!\u201d She cried even harder.\nAt this point, Remus decided that he was definitely in over his head. He patted her, awkwardly once more, and said,\n\u201cI\u2019ll um\u2026 go and get Lily, shall I?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no it\u2019s ok\u2026\u201d Marlene pulled away, still sniffling. Her usually pale face was now red and blotchy, her grey eyes still glistening. \u201cI\u2019ll just go and wash my face,\u201d she gestured towards the nearest girl\u2019s loos, \u201cWill you wait for me?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 ok.\u201d\nShe disappeared and Remus slumped heavily against the wall. He now found himself carrying both of their book bags, and his shoulders ached under the weight. What might the others do, in this situation? James would be chivalrous, obviously. He probably would have known exactly what to say to stop her from crying. Peter would never get himself in the situation in the first place. Sirius\u2026 well Remus thought Sirius was probably as bad as he was, actually. He wasn\u2019t good with emotions; he could barely manage his own.\nStill, Remus knew that the right thing was to wait and walk her back to the common room, so he did. It wasn\u2019t that Remus didn\u2019t feel sympathetic towards Marlene \u2013 the pressure on everyone felt enormous, you could hardly ignore it. It was more Remus\u2019s general distaste for whinging. And of course he\u2019d never liked being around people who cried; it made him nervous.\nMarlene looked much better when she came out of the bathroom. A bit flushed, but at least she was calm.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d she smiled at him, shyly, \u201cI feel silly.\u201d\n\u201cS\u2019ok.\u201d Remus shrugged. He wondered if he could give her back her bag now. His arms really hurt and his dodgy knee was playing up \u2013 never mind his hip. No, probably not. Not a very James thing to do, make a girl carry her own stuff. She didn\u2019t offer to take it back, either. Luckily, they weren\u2019t too far from Gryffindor tower.\n\u201cI am being silly,\u201d she said, as they walked, \u201cI know I am \u2013 my stepdad hates it when I get wound up. Says it winds him up. Then mum gets the worst of it. Danny says I need to toughen up and stop acting like a baby, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s Danny?\u201d Remus asked, a bit lost.\n\u201cMy brother,\u201d she sounded surprised, \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve mentioned him. He\u2019s a beater for the Chudley Cannons.\u201d\n\u201cOh right, yeah I did know that.\u201d Remus nodded, \u201cMust be why you\u2019re so good.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not as good as Danny.\u201d\n\u201cWell.\u201d Remus tried to shrug under the weight of the books, \u201cYou\u2019re only fourteen. Bet your brother wasn\u2019t as good at fourteen. You beat Sirius, and he\u2019s really good.\u201d\n\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus replied, casually. \u201cObviously. Gryffindor won the cup again this year, didn\u2019t they?\u201d\n\u201cBecause of\nJames\n.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well James is mental, you don\u2019t want to be like James.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t tell Mary what I said, will you?\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d He had already forgotten what she\u2019d said about Mary, to be honest.\n\u201cShe\u2019s my best friend,\u201d Marlene sniffed, \u201cAnd I\u2019m not jealous of her or anything, she\u2019s just\u2026 well she likes to show off, you know. She\u2019s so funny and chatty and everything, sometimes I feel a bit\u2026 I mean, she\u2019s already been out with Sirius and now she\u2019s got that muggle boyfriend,\nand\nI think Professor Ferox likes her more than me.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a\nteacher\n.\u201d Remus said, \u201cHe likes everyone the same. Anyway, you\u2019re funny. James is always going on about how you get everyone laughing at quidditch practice.\u201d\n\u201cReally?!\u201d She seemed to flush again at this news. \u201cWhat about\u2026 um\u2026 what about Sirius, does he think I\u2019m funny?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, obviously,\u201d Remus nodded, pleased that she was finally smiling again, \u201cWe all do. Your impression of McGonagall is the best.\u201d\nThis seemed to satisfy her, and by the time they\u2019d reached the common room Marlene looked positively cheerful. \u201cI\u2019ll help you with crups if you want.\u201d Remus said, as they climbed through the portrait hole. \u201cWe can do it tomorrow at lunch.\u201d\n\u201cThanks Remus.\u201d Marlene wrapped her arms around him again in a quick hug. She took her books and headed upstairs to her dorm room. Remus let out another sigh, sagging slightly with relief. Why did this always happen to him? Maybe he needed to start being meaner.\nBehind him, someone wolf-whistled, loudly. He didn\u2019t need to turn around to know who it was.\n\u201cHere he comes! Look out, ladies, Gryffindor\u2019s number one heartthrob, coming through!\u201d Sirius crowed as Remus went over to join his friends by the fire. James was immersed in a book, but looked up and winked at Remus. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to tell us your secret, Moony,\u201d Sirius continued, \u201cYou seem to get all the girls.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s just a friend and you know it. Where\u2019s Pete?\u201d\n\u201cShowering,\u201d James replied, \u201cPeeves attacked him with a jug of yesterday\u2019s custard.\u201d\n\u201cEurgh.\u201d\n\u201cYep, that\u2019s the sound he made,\u201d James smirked, returning to his book.\n\u201cThank merlin you\u2019re back,\u201d Sirius addressed Remus, \u201cJames has been so boring today.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m revising.\u201d James said, calmly, turning a page, \u201cYou should be too.\u201d\n\u201cPfft.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m done revising for today,\u201d Remus grinned, \u201cWant a game of snap?\u201d\n\u201cHave I told you lately how much I love you?\u201d\n\u201cShut up and get the cards.\u201d"

            "content": "You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it\n\nAnd the clock waits so patiently on your song\n\nYou walk past a caf\u00e9, but you don't eat when you've lived too long\n\nOh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide.\nFriday 28\nth\nJune, 1974\nUnsurprisingly, Sirius achieved obscenely high marks in everything except Astronomy without lifting so much as a finger to study. By this point, Remus wasn\u2019t sure if Sirius genuinely did have some strange pureblood gift, or if he was just an unrecognised genius. Remus didn\u2019t mind either way \u2013 he himself came top in Care of Magical Creatures, Runes and History of Magic \u2013 second highest in Arithmancy, after Sirius.\n\u201cNicely done, kid!\u201d Ferox slapped him on the back at breakfast, the morning after results came out. \u201cMy best student.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, professor,\u201d Remus grinned, feeling dizzy with pleasure.\n\u201cI\u2019ve a few books you might like to borrow over the summer \u2013 pop up to my office before you leave, eh?\u201d\n\u201cTeacher\u2019s pet!\u201d Sirius teased, as the tall, jovial man walked away, whistling a jaunty tune. Remus didn\u2019t respond \u2013 he was too pleased with himself.\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe that\u2019s it \u2018til fourth year now.\u201d James said, cleaning his glasses on his robes.\n\u201cDo you have to keep reminding me?\u201d Sirius moaned, setting down his knife and fork.\n\u201cPlenty to do over the summer,\u201d James replied, \u201cIt\u2019ll fly by.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing over the summer?\u201d Remus asked, suspiciously.\n\u201cPlanning next year\u2019s pranks, obviously,\u201d Sirius said, a little bit too quickly. \u201cGot to keep ahead of the curve, Remu my boy, we\u2019ve a reputation to maintain.\u201d\nIt was the last official day of term, so Remus decided ignore the fact that this was clearly a lie. He had all summer to be paranoid about the other three leaving him out; there was no need to worry yet.\nAfter breakfast, he wanted to go straight to see Professor Ferox, but thought that might come across a bit too eager \u2013 plus, the other three would surely want to come with him, and Remus couldn\u2019t stand the thought of Ferox meeting Sirius and James. He would no doubt be charmed by their natural born charisma, and wonder why he\u2019d ever thought Remus was special at all.\nThe foursome went upstairs and packed \u2013 that is, James, Remus and Peter packed. Sirius bounced around the room trying to distract them, sending books and clothes flying, flicking his record player on and off.\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting done whether you like it or not,\u201d James chastised, hands on his hips in a very good imitation of his mother.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do it for me, like last year,\u201d Sirius replied, standing on his bed and attempting to do pull-ups hanging off the bed frame. The ancient wooden beams creaked.\nRemus closed his own trunk. His corner of the room looked very bare without the usual chaos of books, papers, quills and clothes strewn about it. He went over to the record player to have one last fond caress of his favourite album covers. Summers were so quiet, without Sirius\u2019s music. Matron only ever liked to have the radio on once a week \u2013 for the Radio 3 Choral Evensong.\n\u201cMoony,\u201d James said, suddenly, \u201cDon\u2019t you have to go and see Madam Pomfrey?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 yeah, but not right now\u2026\u201d Remus looked up, surprised.\n\u201cWell, I mean if you\u2019ve finished packing, you may as well, right? When I\u2019ve done Sirius\u2019s stuff I was going to suggest we all go out for a go on our brooms, and you hate flying, so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, really? Ok then.\u201d Remus nodded, feeling unaccountably hurt. It wasn\u2019t at all like James to chase you out of the room.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see you at dinner, right Moony?\u201d Sirius asked, swinging forward and landing on his feet with the agility of a gymnast.\n\u201cYeah, I s\u2019pose\u2026\u201d Remus left the room, feeling as if he was being escorted from a party to which he was not invited. Fair enough, he didn\u2019t like flying much. But that didn\u2019t usually matter \u2013 often he\u2019d sit in the stands and read his book while the others mucked about in the air. He wouldn\u2019t have minded doing that this time.\nHe\ndid\nhave to see Madam Pomfrey, anyway, so he went to the hospital wing, struggling to shake off the nasty feeling of exile.\n* * *\n\u201cYou\u2019re very quiet, dear,\u201d the medi-witch commented as she completed his end of year checks. \u201cNot looking forward to your holidays?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not really,\u201d he replied.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll miss your friends,\u201d she clucked her tongue sympathetically. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, I know. Still, I expect you\u2019ve got lots of muggle pals to play with.\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t bother answering. Madam Pomfrey was very kind, and hadn\u2019t a bad bone in her body, but she \u2013 like most adults \u2013 could be incredibly dense. He was privately hoping that the coming summer would be just as lucrative as the last \u2013 if Craig was still about then perhaps he could make a bit of cash. He\u2019d proved himself capable, he might even ask for more than just cigarettes.\nShe gave him the same instructions as the year before \u2013 eat well, exercise and rest.\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you in early July,\u201d she smiled serenely, and he was comforted with the thought that at least he wouldn\u2019t be completely isolated from the wizarding community.\nThat being dealt with, Remus considered returning to the dormitory. Perhaps they were all finished talking about him, or whatever it was they needed him out of the way for. Perhaps they\u2019d gone flying already. He didn\u2019t begrudge them that; James was of the opinion that if Sirius was in a temper, or too wound up, then a good hour\u2019s exercise was the best thing (and it generally was). Plus, it was one of the few times Peter did not get left out. Despite his clumsiness on land, Pettigrew was a surprisingly good flyer. No doubt a result of James\u2019s relentless drilling.\nIt was really the perfect time to go and see Professor Ferox, of course, but Remus dawdled. He felt suddenly quite shy, never having been to see a teacher alone before \u2013 unless he was in trouble, of course. Walking slowly, he eventually had to make a directional choice at a particular corridor, and decided he may as well get it over with.\nHe knocked tentatively on Ferox\u2019s office door, even though it was slightly ajar. His heart hammered in his chest and he found himself half hoping that his teacher wasn\u2019t there after all. Remus couldn\u2019t help but recall with some embarrassment how only a few weeks ago he had almost come running to Ferox in a moment of panic, only to recognise that it was a terrible idea at the very last minute.\n\u201cCome in!\u201d Ferox\u2019s cheery voice echoed from inside the room. Remus squared his shoulders and entered. \u201cMr Lupin!\u201d Ferox boomed.\nHe was not sitting at his desk \u2013 Remus didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever seen Ferox seated, except at mealtimes, he was always moving. Just now, he was packing a small trunk, Achilles the kneazle watching quietly from the windowsill. Even after a year of lessons with Ferox, Remus was still somewhat in awe of his teacher. His gigantic presence had not diminished, his mane of sandy curls was still as glorious, his face still heroic with decisively carved features.\n\u201cHello, sir,\u201d Remus smiled as he entered, closing the door behind himself. \u201cYou asked to see me?\u201d\n\u201cIndeed I did,\u201d Ferox smiled broadly, nodding to a pile of five books on his desk, \u201cThose are for you, if you\u2019ve room in your trunk. Next year\u2019s set text and a few other things I thought might interest you.\u201d\nRemus approached the desk and fingered the leather-bound tomes carefully,\n\u201cThank you, professor,\u201d he said, quietly. He\u2019d never received such an enormous gift before. Ferox nodded, sitting down, finally, gesturing that Remus do the same.\n\u201cButterbeer?\u201d He withdrew some bottles from the bottom draw of his desk.\n\u201cThank you, professor,\u201d Remus repeated, accepting the bottle and sitting down.\nAchilles, on the window ledge, stretched, yawned, then curled up to sleep, peacefully. Remus felt he ought to say something else. \u201cDumbledore normally sends me my books and stuff.\u201d He offered, \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know you\u2019re a bit out of the loop during the holidays, so I thought you might appreciate a head start.\u201d Ferox continued to smile his big easy smile.\nRemus felt a strange kind of warmth fizzing in his abdomen. Which was odd, because he hadn\u2019t so much as sipped his butterbeer yet.\n\u201cKind of you.\u201d He said, looking down at the books again, uncomfortable with too much eye contact.\n\u201cI\u2019m not being charitable, Remus, I promise,\u201d Ferox said, reassuringly, \u201cI know what it\u2019s like, y\u2019see. I came to Hogwarts with almost as little as you did. Muggleborn \u2013 raised by my Nan. \u2018Course, she never understood anything I did here. Bless her heart.\u201d\nRemus blinked. This was interesting news \u2013 he had assumed that most of the teachers at Hogwarts \u2013 in fact, most of the adults he respected \u2013 were all purebloods. It was an immense relief to learn that this wasn\u2019t the case.\n\u201cUs rough kids have to stick together, eh?\u201d Ferox winked at him.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus continued to nod, emphatically. \u201cSo, you never had a problem getting a job or stuff like that? After school?\u201d\n\u201cWell, there are always going to be folks who can\u2019t see past your blood status, no matter who you are,\u201d Ferox said, a wry smirk in his voice, \u201cBut you learn pretty quick how to prove \u2018em wrong. Well; I don\u2019t need to tell you.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus agreed. He took a swig of his butterbeer. \u201cSo\u2026 are you an orphan too, professor?\u201d\n\u201cI am. Common as muck, too, you wouldn\u2019t believe the flack I got for this accent back then.\u201d\n\u201cMary and Marlene think you sound like Paul McCartney.\u201d Remus said. Ferox laughed, a great, joyful, wheezing laugh,\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to remember that one next time I\u2019m on the pull.\u201d\nRemus felt himself blushing, hearing Ferox talk like that.\n\u201cJust goes to show,\u201d Ferox said, \u201cYou never know how other people are going to see you. So never assume, eh?\u201d\nRemus looked up at him, curiously, but gave a smll nod of understanding. The professor\u2019s expression softened. \u201cRemus,\u201d Ferox said, so gently that it was unnerving, \u201cI\u2026 there\u2019s something else I wanted to talk to you about.\u201d\nRemus winced \u2013 he thought he knew what was coming. He\u2019d been waiting for it since before Christmas. \u201cPerfectly fine if you don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d the teacher said.\n\u201cIs it about\u2026 my problem?\u201d\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\u201d Ferox said, in a measured tone. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know this, but I knew your father, Lyall, quite well.\u201d\nRemus almost choked on his butterbeer. He hadn\u2019t quite expected that. Ferox continued, \u201cOur work often overlapped, you see \u2013 I was young, hadn\u2019t long started in the Control of Magical Creatures department. I knew him by reputation, of course, so I tried to learn what I could, though I never did master boggarts quite like he did.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d Remus didn\u2019t know what else to say.\n\u201cDo you know much about him?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Remus looked away, out of the window. He didn\u2019t think he could talk and look at Ferox at the same time. \u201cHe was a Ravenclaw,\u201d he started, as if ticking off items on a list, \u201cHe was good at duelling. He was good at boggarts and dementors and poltergeists, and he hated werewolves, he wanted them all dead and he\u2026\u201d Remus choked, wanting to stand up and leave the room.\n\u201cWhere did you hear all of that?\u201d Ferox looked shocked. Remus looked at him, though everything was swimming in tears now. It felt as though all of the nasty, spiteful thoughts he\u2019d been having since December had come pouring out like poison.\n\u201cDarius Barebones.\u201d He said, rubbing his eyes roughly on the sleeves of his robes, forcing himself under control. \u201cMet him at the Potter\u2019s Christmas party.\u201d\n\u201cThat old pisshead.\u201d Ferox snapped, gruffly. He looked annoyed, but not at Remus. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Lupin, what a thing to hear. It\u2019s not true, you know.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t hate\u2026 them?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Ferox tilted his head, as if trying to be diplomatic, \u201cHe was concerned about the danger werewolves pose to society. But he was a sensible man, too sensible for hatred. You\u2019re a lot like him.\u201d\nRemus snorted bitterly at that.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d Ferox said, firmly. \u201cHe was a good man. He\u2019d do anything for anyone.\u201d\n\u201cDarius said he thought Lyall was bitten by Greyback, that\u2019s why he killed himself.\u201d\n\u201cYou know about Greyback, then?\u201d\nRemus nodded. Ferox looked very serious indeed. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that rumour. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Dumbledore started it to protect you, to be honest. Personally, I never believed it. Then I met you of course, and it all became clear.\u201d\n\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d Remus asked, raising his fingers to the scar on his face, over a year old now, but still stark and red.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ferox shook his head, \u201cMost wizards wouldn\u2019t know a werewolf if it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJumped up and bit them?\u201d\nFerox laughed, lifting the dark mood that had settled over the bright little office.\n\u201cYour father\u2019s sense of humour, too.\u201d\nRemus smiled, weakly.\n\u201cProfessor?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened to Greyback?\u201d\nFerox instantly turned serious again.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t know for certain. He\u2019s still alive, as far as the ministry is concerned, and still wanted for his crimes. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll ever catch him, to be honest, the man\u2019s a maniac, by all accounts.\u201d\n\u201cCould he\u2026 find me?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\nRemus was startled by Ferox\u2019s honesty. He didn\u2019t seem as concerned as most adults about protecting him from the harsher truths. \u201cDoes that frighten you?\u201d The teacher asked.\nRemus shrugged.\n\u201cI think\u2026 I think maybe I\u2019ve always known that. That I\u2019m going to meet him again.\u201d\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t go looking\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Remus knew that was a lie, but he also knew that there was nothing Ferox could do to stop him.\n\u201cIf you have more questions, I want you to feel comfortable asking me.\u201d Ferox said, \u201cThere are some old newspaper clippings inside that top book,\u201d he nodded at the pile he\u2019d gifted Remus, \u201cI thought you ought to have them. Things like that oughtn\u2019t to be kept from people, and you\u2019re old enough.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, professor.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t upset you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, professor.\u201d\n\u201cGood lad.\u201d Ferox stood up, leaned over the desk and squeezed Remus\u2019s shoulder in a friendly sort of way. \u201cTry and have a good summer, eh? I\u2019ll see you in September.\u201d\nRemus nodded, feeling a bit dazed by the events of the past half an hour. Nonetheless, he was quite grateful to be dismissed, and quietly left, carrying the heavy pile of books back upstairs to the common room.\nIt was very quiet in Gryffindor tower now. Most of the students had finished their packing and were no doubt outside enjoying the grounds. Remus\u2019s thoughts turned to Davy Gudgeon, and he squashed that down. One emotional crisis at a time.\nThe marauders were gone too, Sirius\u2019s things now neatly packed away in his serpent chest. The room was stuffy and hot, Remus flicked his wand to swing the windows open, then went to sit on his bed and open the first book.\nSure enough, pressed like dead leaves between the inside cover and the front page, three yellowing newspaper clippings:\n\nThe Daily Prophet\n, April 1964\nWEREWOLF ATTACKS ON THE RISE \u2013 could your children be next?\nThe Ministry of Magic has today confirmed that the recent spate of murders both in the muggle and wizarding communities is the work of dark creatures \u2013 namely werewolves. Ministry officials are particularly concerned that in many cases the victims of the attacks have been children under the age of ten.\nOne official, respected dark creatures expert Lyall Lupin, has spoken out and criticised the ministry for \u201cLax and wilfully neglectful safety measures\u201d. Lupin claims that the ministry\u2019s current werewolf registry is poorly managed and maintained, enabling certain anti-ministry factions to use these loopholes to their advantage.\nThe current number of victims is suspected to be seventeen, but set to rise as the investigation continues, and the perpetrators continue to allude capture. A statement from the Auror\u2019s office is expected later today.\n\nThe Daily Prophet, Obituaries\n, January 1965\nLyall Lupin, who has died aged 36, will be remembered as a world-renowned expert on non-human spirituous apparitions, for his extensive work with boggarts and poltergeists, dementor liaisons, and, more recently, his efforts to reform the national werewolf registry.\nLupin is survived by his wife, muggle Hope Lupin, who he married in Cardiff in 1959. The couple have a young son, Remus John Lupin, born in 1960. The family has requested privacy during their time of grief.\n\nThe Daily Prophet\n, February 1965\nAURORS ON LOOKOUT FOR GREYBACK\nThe Auror\u2019s Office is appealing to the wizarding public for any information pertaining to the whereabouts of Fenrir Greyback, werewolf and suspected child murderer.\nGreyback is described as 6\u20193, very strong, and unclean, with the appearance of a vagrant. Wizards and witches are warned not to approach him, and to consider Greyback extremely dangerous, even in human form. Auror Alastor Moody today made a statement indicating that the ministry believe Greyback to be travelling with a pack of werewolves, making him all the more dangerous. Greyback is known to have a preference for small children, but Moody declined to comment on speculation that the werewolves plan to raise an army.\nThe ministry also declined to respond to allegations that they had Greyback in their custody last spring, and failed to recognise the threat.\nSince the death of Lyall Lupin, an outspoken advocate for harsher sanctions on werewolves, there have been numerous efforts to improve recognition and registration of dark creatures.\n\nThe first time he read them, Remus didn\u2019t even use his reading aid. The second, third and fourth times, he did. And over and over, as if there was something more in them, as if he could suck the truth right out. He had no more answers than before, and a hot, angry ball of rage had begun growing inside his chest, burning brighter as he re-read and re-read.\nHours passed, the room grew dark, and in the end he never went down to the feast."

Regulus won\u2019t tell me what goes on \u2013 I think they\u2019ve probably put a\nlips locked\nspell on him or something, because normally he couldn\u2019t resist lording something like that over me.\nI feel like something bad is going to happen. I know that sounds stupid, but something\u2019s definitely not right in this house. Sometimes I\u2019m glad you and James and Peter are all such a long way away.\nI\u2019m going to try and ask to stay with James again. I know it\u2019s mental, but honestly, if they\u2019re just going to ignore me anyway, what\u2019s the point? I haven\u2019t even been asked to be an usher at Cissy\u2019s wedding (all the better, to be honest) so there\u2019s always the possibility that they\u2019ve disinherited me and just forgotten to mention it.\nI can\u2019t wait until we\u2019re all seventeen, then we can just live together all the time, like at Hogwarts. I want to live on Carnaby Street, like in\nMelody Maker\n. You\u2019ll have to show me around \u2013 I know how the money works now, thanks to Muggle Studies.\nBest,\nSirius O. Black.\n* * *\nSirius,\nEverything\u2019s ok here, don\u2019t worry about me.\nI don\u2019t really know what you mean by \u2018something bad\u2019. Do you think they\u2019re going to try to hurt you again? If you do, then definitely try and go to the Potters. Maybe they can tell Dumbledore or someone.\nSorry to disappoint you, but I\u2019ve never been to Carnaby Street. St Edmund\u2019s is in Essex, and we only go into London once a year, usually to the museums. You\u2019d probably like the Science Museum, full of muggle inventions.\nBe careful, ok?\nRemus.\n* * *\nDear Moony,\nJust so you know, Sirius is coming to stay with us this summer. He should be arriving this afternoon, so send his post here. Hope your summer is going well? You seemed a bit off at the end of term.\nI know you\u2019re going to say no, but Mum and Dad still say you\u2019re invited to stay whenever you like. And we could always come to you, just to visit. Don\u2019t want you to be alone out there, mate, especially these days.\nJames.\n* * *\nJames,\nWhat do you mean \u2018these days\u2019? Is this what Sirius was on about with his family meetings? You know what the Blacks are like, they just love secrets. It\u2019s probably nothing. They\u2019re probably planning Regulus\u2019s betrothal or something like that and want Sirius out of the way.\nAnyway, like I told Sirius, don\u2019t worry about me. Dumbledore and Madam Pomfrey reckon this is where I\u2019m safest, and they\u2019re the ones in charge of me, right? Obviously I would rather spend the summer at yours, but it\u2019s not happening, so can you please drop it?\nDon\u2019t come here, either, just trust me.\nR.\n* * *\nDear Remus,\nSorry if I upset you, mate, I didn\u2019t mean to. I\u2019ll stop asking about it, if you want me to.\nHope you\u2019re having a good summer anyway, we all wish you were here. You\u2019re right, if Dumbledore says you\u2019re safe there, you\u2019re safe there. Dad says Dumbledore might be the only one we can trust, soon enough.\nTake care of yourself,\nJames.\n* * *\nHi Moony,\nFour marauders are definitely better than three. It\u2019s great having Sirius here and all, but it\u2019s like we always have to do whatever he wants.\nI\u2019m mostly just lucky that mum lets me see them at all, after Phil left home. I got a post card from her the other day, she\u2019s in America, can you believe that? She said to say hello to you, so \u2018hello\u2019 from Phil.\nPeter.\n* * *\nMoony,\nWhy did you have a go at James? He thinks you didn\u2019t mean to come off like that, but I know what you\u2019re like, you moody git. What\u2019s up?\nSirius O. Black\nP.S. How come Philomena said \u2018hello\u2019 to you, and not to any of us? You\u2019re such a bloody ladies man.\n* * *\nRemus,\nI know you got my last letter, the owl came back, and the Potter\u2019s owls are even more reliable than my family\u2019s.\nWhy aren\u2019t you replying?\nSirius O. Black\n* * *\nRemus? Please let us know you\u2019re ok?\nJames.\n* * *\nMoony?\n* * *\nCraig had been nicked at some point over the school year, and Remus returned to find that Craig\u2019s mate, Ste, was now in charge of the criminal element at St Edmund\u2019s. He was a good deal uglier and stupider than Craig.\n\u201cBit tall for robbin\u2019 now, in\u2019t cha?\u201d Ste squinted at Remus.\n\u201cStill skinny.\u201d Remus replied, holding his nerve.\n\u201c\u2019ow\u2019d you get all them scars?\u201d\n\u201cFighting.\u201d\nSte laughed meanly.\n\u201cYeah, right. Weedy little toff like you.\u201d\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Remus took a step closer, \u201cI ain\u2019t no toff.\u201d He was as tall as the sixteen-year-old \u2013 maybe even a few inches taller. Yes, he was weedy, but he was holding his ground, and Ste was starting to look a lot less sure of himself.\n\u201cAlright.\u201d The bigger boy said, tilting his head back, away from Remus. \u201cCalm down mate. You\u2019re in.\u201d\nRemus sneered at him, turned and walked away, satisfied.\nNot much had given him satisfaction so far that summer. He felt more isolated than ever before \u2013 and angrier than he had been in a long time.\nRemus almost hated Ferox for giving him the information he had on the last day of term \u2013 so that he could not make sense of it, or do anything about it. There was no one to tell; he was forbidden from mentioning Hogwarts to anyone at St Edmund\u2019s, and he didn\u2019t even know where to begin with the other marauders.\nTheir letters infuriated him, and he balled every one of them up in his fist then threw them away. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to read, or watch TV, or even touch his homework. He felt as though he had boundless pent up energy, like an animal stalking the length of its cage. It built inside him, heating up until he was blazing with the desire to lash out and beat the shit out of the next person who crossed him.\nFortunately, most of the St Edmund\u2019s boys seemed to sense this. Though Remus barely spoke a word to anyone, the other kids avoided him like the plague.\nSo, he sought out Ste.\nTheir first job was an easy one; he didn\u2019t even need to be small for it. They stole a car, and all he had to do was climb in with the rest of them. They drove around for most of the night, smoking and drinking from a bottle of vodka they\u2019d pinched from the off-licence some weeks prior.\nRemus decided that he liked smoking. It made him look tougher, and kept his hands busy; he liked rolling cigarettes, and he liked the way they burned, inches from his lips. He liked breathing plumes of smoke and thought of Ferox chasing dragons in Romania.\nThe other boys warmed to him, after they got used to his quietness, and his general odd manner. He was still the youngest in the group, and they began to treat him like a little brother, plying him with fags and booze. Remus got properly drunk for the first time that summer, and they all laughed as he stumbled about in the park, and sympathised when he puked his guts out the next morning.\nWhen they got drunk they liked to fight, too, which suited Remus. In the dark up on the common they threw themselves around, belting out Who songs, or The Jam, or even football chants if they were feeling particularly mindless. None of them seemed to care if Remus was too young or too skinny, and none of them treated him like he was an invalid because of his scars. Sometimes you just needed to get bashed about a bit, and at the end of the night they all staggered home friends.\nThe hot summer weeks passed in a chaotic blur \u2013 Remus spent most of his nights out with Ste and his gang, and his days sleeping off hangovers, trying to keep out of Matron\u2019s way. He didn\u2019t think about Hogwarts. He did very little thinking at all.\n\u201cGotta get you some proper togs, Lupin,\u201d Ste slurred, one night, \u201cCan\u2019t have you looking like a ponce all summer.\u201d\nRemus looked down at his standard issue St Edmund\u2019s jeans and grey t-shirt. There was sick on his plimsoles. Had he done that? He couldn\u2019t remember,\n\u201cAin\u2019t got the cash, \u2018ave I?\u201d He responded, searching for the cigarette he\u2019d tucked behind his ear only a few minutes ago \u2013 or at least he thought he had.\n\u201cSo?\u201d Aggie, a short and chubby boy who reminded Remus of Peter shrugged, \u201cMy mate works in a warehouse down Southend, we\u2019ll get you some proper gear.\u201d\nAnd they really did. For once, Remus looked like all the other boys his age \u2013 not in second hand clothes, but brand new. Bright blue drainpipe jeans, a button-down shirt (knock-off Ben Sherman, but as good as the real thing), white braces and black bovver boots. They shaved his hair right down, even shorter than Matron did it.\n\u201cYou look the business.\u201d Ste caught him under his arm, rubbing his head with rough knuckles.\nWhen the moon came, and Madam Pomfrey saw him, she pursed her lips.\n\u201cI\u2019ll say nothing about the outfit,\u201d she said, primly, \u201cBut I don\u2019t like the look of all these bruises \u2013 you must tell me if the other boys are hurting you.\u201d\nHe just shook his head and waited for her to lock the door \u2013 he could already feel his blood boiling as the change began.\nThe next day, he was too weak to move. Madam Pomfrey insisted on staying the whole day to watch him, even arranging for a bed to be brought down to his little cell. Hangovers had nothing on transformations, Remus thought to himself. He\u2019d have killed for a fag, though.\nBored, and too tired to be angry, he finally reached for a book. The three slips of newspaper fell out again and he quickly slammed the cover shut before Madam Pomfrey could see.\nGreyback\n.\nThat\nwas why he was so angry, he realised, in the first moment of clarity he\u2019d had all summer. In fact, Greyback was pretty much the reason behind everything that had ever gone wrong in Remus\u2019s \u00a0life. Where could he be? How could you hunt a werewolf? There were plenty of books on that in the Hogwarts library, but Remus had always avoided them before, frightened of what they might say.\nWell, tough. He\u2019d have to stop being squeamish about stuff like that. He had to stop hiding from himself; stop letting everyone walk all over him, if he was ever going to\u2026 yes.\nHe was going to kill Greyback. To hunt him down, and then\nput him down\n, just like his father had wanted. Lyall Lupin would not have died in vain. A bolt of adrenalin shot through Remus as he thought about it. It was much better than rage.\nIt might take years before he was ready, he knew that. And he\u2019d need money. As soon as Remus was fit, he approached Ste once more.\n\u201cAlright Lupin, me old pal?\u201d The older boy smirked with yellow teeth through a haze of sweet, green smelling smoke. \u201cBloody hell, what happened to you?\u201d He frowned at Remus\u2019s fresh cuts.\n\u201cNever mind that.\u201d Remus growled, no longer stressing his old accent, \u201cLast summer Craig did over so many off-licences and pubs I had a trunk full of fag packets. This year I\u2019ve got bugger all. You not as hard as Craig, or something?\u201d\n\u201cOi,\u201d Ste sat up, hooking his thumbs behind his braces, \u201cWatch it.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you watch it.\u201d Remus snarled, showing teeth, \u201cI\u2019ve got two weeks left, and I need to stock up. Are you in, or not?\u201d"

            "content": "Sunday 1\nst\nSeptember 1974\nAs Remus approached King\u2019s Cross station for the fourth time in his early life, he felt utterly invincible. He had grown taller still over the summer, and his face had changed too \u2013 no longer childish and round; his jaw was set and his eyes mean. In his heavy black boots (polished to a shine that morning) and his smart new clothes, Remus felt a stronger sense of identity than he had ever had. Ste had been very keen to give him a tattoo before he returned to school, but Remus had balked at that \u2013 he had enough marks already.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll all think you\u2019ve joined a gang,\u201d Matron tutted, barely concealing her disdain as she dropped him outside the station, \u201cYou look like a delinquent.\u201d\n\u201cPiss off,\u201d he muttered, \u201cWhat do you care?\u201d\nShe gave him a sharp clip around the ear, and he winced. She had to reach up to do that these days, but she still knew exactly where it hurt most.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be at school before it gets dark, won\u2019t you?\u201d She said, business-like. He nodded, sullenly. It was a full moon that night. \u201cGood.\u201d She nodded. \u201cSee you next summer, then.\u201d\nHe entered the station alone, and walked through the crowds with a practiced masculine gait \u2013 legs apart, hands balled into fists. People moved quickly out of his way as he approached, and a station guard eyed him suspiciously. Remus ignored them all and strode forward, purposefully, directly through the ticket barrier, bursting onto Platform 9 \u00be without so much as flinching.\nHe was late, and the platform was already almost empty, with only the last few tearful parents of first years lingering to wave goodbye. A cursory glance told Remus that the other three marauders were already on the train, so he climbed aboard and headed straight for their usual compartment, pushing roughly past the other students \u2013 many of whom seemed very small to him now \u2013 as he struggled with his battered old trunk.\nThey were in there; all three sitting squashed up on the same side of the compartment, huddled behind the morning edition of\nThe Daily Prophet\n.\n\u201cAlright?\u201d Remus said, as he entered.\nJames, who was sat in the middle, holding the paper, lowered it, and three pairs of eyes stared up at Remus. Peter looked white and nervous, which was pretty normal, and began to chew his bottom lip, glancing at James for an appropriate response.\nJames smiled, trying to be friendly, but his brown eyes wandered over Remus, from his steel toed boots to his closely shaved head. Sirius was hardest to read; his eyes widened slightly, but his expression remained neutral. Remus slung himself into the seat opposite as if he had not noticed. \u201cGood summer?\u201d\n\u201cNot bad,\u201d James said, cautiously, \u201cThe usual, you know\u2026 how was yours?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, good.\u201d Remus withdrew a small tin case from his back pocket and opened it to reveal five pre-rolled cigarettes. He placed one between his lips and lit it with a match as the train began to pull away from the station.\nPeter was now staring at Remus with his mouth slightly open, as if he didn\u2019t recognise him. James looked concerned, a small crease formed between his eyebrows,\n\u201cWe were worried when we didn\u2019t hear from you.\u201d\n\u201cSorry. Busy.\u201d Remus shrugged, exhaling smoke.\n\u201cDoing what?\u201d Sirius asked, bluntly. James got up to open the window and let the smoke out, but he didn\u2019t say anything about it.\n\u201cJust busy.\u201d Remus said.\nThey\nkept secrets from him, after all. He didn\u2019t have to tell them everything.\n\u201cAre you ok, Remus?\u201d James asked finally. \u201cHas something happened?\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem different.\u201d\n\u201cYour clothes!\u201d Peter squeaked, suddenly.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen muggles dressed like it,\u201d Sirius finally spoke up, \u201cIt\u2019s\ncool\n, right, Remus?\u201d\nRemus shrugged again, feeling pleased, but hoping he looked outwardly nonchalant.\n\u201cMy mates got \u2018em for me, that\u2019s all.\u201d He said.\n\u201cOh, well, if it\u2019s a muggle thing\u2026\u201d James said, uncertainly. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re ok?\u201d\n\u201cLay off, Potter,\u201d Remus sighed, rolling his eyes. He didn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore. Though he\u2019d expected \u2013 even\nwanted\n\u2013 a reaction, he didn\u2019t like the way they were all staring at him. Typical purebloods, they could prance around in hundred-year-old robes and stupid pointed hats and nobody said a word \u2013 but jeans and doc martens were apparently a step too far.\n\u201cWhat you reading, then?\u201d He asked, nodding at the newspaper, hoping to distract them.\nJames looked gravely down at the broadsheet in his lap.\n\u201cThe war.\u201d He said, handing Remus the\nProphet\n.\n\u201cWar?!\u201d That made him sit up straight. \u201cWhat war?\u201d He looked down at the headline, which read\n\u2018Jenkins criticised as security measures on ministry tightened\u2019\n.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you know?\u201d James looked incredulous, \u201cThe wizarding world has been officially at war since 1970.\u201d\nSirius and Peter nodded, solemnly.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t even at Hogwarts in 1970,\u201d Remus said, defensively, \u201cI hardly knew\nanything\nabout wizards then. What\u2026 I mean, who are we fighting?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem,\u201d James said, brusquely, \u201cIt\u2019s too difficult to know, but this \u2018Dark Lord\u2019 person has been gathering a lot of allies \u2013 almost all purebloods.\u201d\n\u201cI reckon those are the meetings my family are going to,\u201d Sirius said, his voice low, even though they were alone. \u201cJames\u2019s dad agrees with me.\u201d\n\u201cIs that why the Slytherins were such a pleasure to be around last year?\u201d Remus asked, connecting the dots now.\n\u201cYep,\u201d Sirius said. \u201cAnd it\u2019ll be worse this year, you can bet.\u201d\n\u201cThere were some\u2026 attacks, this summer.\u201d James said, nervously. \u201cOn muggles, and a few mixed blood families.\u201d\n\u201cThey think the Dark Lord is using dangerous creatures,\u201d Peter said, his voice trembling with fear, \u201cVampires and giants and\u2026 and\u2026\u201d\nRemus shot him a look, and clenched his jaw,\n\u201cAnd werewolves?\u201d\n\u201cMoony\u2026\u201d James started.\n\u201cI need the loo.\u201d Remus stood up, quickly, exiting the compartment.\nHe stormed through the train, younger students leaping out of his way as he passed them, terrified. He didn\u2019t need the loo, obviously, but he there wasn\u2019t exactly anywhere else to go, so he locked himself inside a cubical at the far end of the carriage. It was much posher than the loos on muggle trains \u2013 with actual red velvet curtains in the windows and glimmering gold fixtures. The mirror even had a gilt frame. He stared at himself for a few minutes, glaring into his own eyes, clenching the sides of the sink until his knuckles turned white.\nHe\u2019d thought he would be so tough after this summer \u2013 thought that nothing could touch him now. But everything was already unravelling, faster than he had expected, and he\u2019d lost it at the very first mention of werewolves. How would he ever do what needed to be done if he couldn\u2019t stay calm? Greyback would eat him for breakfast.\nUnable to look at himself any longer, Remus sat on the toilet seat and considered punching the soap dispenser. That probably wouldn\u2019t provide the satisfaction he needed, and he\u2019d only end up covered in floral scented pink slime. He kicked the basin with his boot instead, leaving a long black rubber streak on the white porcelain.\n\u201cFuck.\u201d He muttered. That felt good. \u201cFUCK.\u201d He shouted, kicking the basin again.\n\u201cWho\u2019s in there?\u201d A sharp rap came at the door.\n\u201cBugger off, it\u2019s occupied.\u201d He shouted back fiercely.\n\u201cThis is a\nSlytherin\ncarriage, you know.\u201d The voice said coldly.\n\u201cOh fuck\noff\nyou stupid busybody.\u201d Remus replied, slamming the door with his elbow.\nIf he had been in a more reasonable state, he might have calmly explained that the carriages were not divided into houses, and actually, anyone could sit anywhere they wanted, even if it was on a closed toilet seat.\n\u201cI shall call for a prefect!\u201d\n\u201cOh my\ngod\n,\u201d Remus stood up, withdrawing his wand, \u201cAre you\nlooking\nfor a fight or something?!\u201d He flung the door open, finding himself face to face with a very shocked looking Severus Snape.\nSeverus might have frightened him when they were both eleven, but at fourteen Remus towered over Snape now, and with his wand raised and his face screwed up in annoyance, he must have been a terrifying sight.\n\u201cYou.\u201d They both hissed. Snape tossed his black greasy hair and sneered,\n\u201cWhat were you doing in there?\u201d\n\u201cNone of your business. Out of my way.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d Snape pulled a face, looking him up and down with disgust. \u201cAre those\nmuggle\nclothes?\u201d\n\u201cSo what if they are?\u201d Remus took a step forward, now so close to the Slytherin boy that he was practically breathing on him. \u201cGot something to say? Not so big without your creepy mates around, are you, Snivellus?\u201d He gave him a hard shove, knocking Snape to the floor.\nSnape glared up at him, scrambling to his feet quickly and dusting off his shabby black robes. He narrowed his eyes,\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find out all about my \u2018mates\u2019 this year,\nLoony Lupin\n, I promise you that.\u201d He said, very coldly.\n\u201cNot exactly in a position to be giving out threats though, are you?\u201d Remus replied, almost conversationally. \u201cI\u2019ve heard\nthat\nlot prefer purebloods\u2026 and Lily\u2019s told me all about\nyou\n, Snape\u2026\u201d\nSnape\u2019s eyes flashed, and a look of pure hatred crossed his face. He reached for his wand but \u2013 whether it was thanks to the closeness of the full moon, or just pure adrenaline \u2013 Remus was too quick for him. He grabbed Severus\u2019s wrist and slammed it against the wall of the carriage, causing the Slytherin to cry out and drop his wand. Then, thinking of nothing but causing the most pain possible, Remus snapped his head forward and butted Serverus, knocking him down a second time.\nSnape was staring up at him, his black eyes shining with fear and rage, he clutched his robes against his nose, which was now gushing blood. Remus, feeling no better about any of it, spat on the floor and stepped over Snape.\n\u201cThere\u2019s your warning for the rest of the year,\u201d he growled, \u201cStay out of my way.\u201d\nSnape said nothing, but didn\u2019t try to get up. Remus walked away, confident the other boy wouldn\u2019t try anything now. He stalked back the way he\u2019d came, trying to get away from the rich, intoxicating smell of blood, and shut himself in the first empty compartment he came across.\nThere he sat, breathing deeply for a few minutes, trying to bring his heartbeat back under control, and to ignore the craving that was echoing somewhere deep inside him, where human reason could not touch it. Eventually, with shaking hands, he pulled out another cigarette, and smoked it broodily, staring out of the window.\nHe was not alone for long.\n\u201cMoony?\u201d The door slid open, and Sirius\u2019s head poked around the door. Remus glared at him, but Sirius came in anyway, and sat opposite. \u201cAll right, what\u2019s up?\u201d\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Remus crossed his arms and slid down in his seat, staring at his boots. The laces didn\u2019t match, red on the left, yellow on the right. He\u2019d thought that looked really cool back in July, but now it looked a bit silly.\n\u201cSomething\u2019s up. You\u2019re not yourself.\u201d\n\u201cHow would you know.\u201d Remus spat in reply. \u201cMaybe this is who I really am.\u201d\n\u201cI just know,\u201d Sirius replied, uncharacteristically calm. Apparently spending so much time at the Potter\u2019s had done wonders for his patience. \u201cIt\u2019s ok to be angry sometimes, Remus. It doesn\u2019t mean anything, except that you\u2019re normal.\u201d\nRemus looked up at him, surprised. Sirius smiled, understandingly, then smirked, \u201cAnd for what it\u2019s worth, I really do think you look\nso\nbloody cool.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Kind of dangerous.\u201d\nRemus snorted at the irony.\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026 bad summer, was it?\u201d\nRemus shrugged,\n\u201cIt was ok. I was\u2026 I did a lot of stuff. I don\u2019t want James to know about it.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d Sirius agreed, then cocked his head, brightly, \u201cCan I try a cigarette?\u201d\nHe pronounced the word as if it was new to him, with a slightly French accent, which was oddly endearing. Remus felt a surge of affection for his friend, which sent his heart pounding again. He fished a fag from his case and tossed it over with the matches. He watched Sirius carefully purse his lips around the white paper cylinder, strike a match and cup his hands close to his face. He didn\u2019t cough, which was bloody impressive in itself, but only took a shallow breath before exhaling, and making a sour face.\n\u201cYou get used to it.\u201d Remus smirked.\n\u201cOk.\u201d Sirius tried again, inhaling more this time.\nIt was weirdly hypnotic, watching Sirius smoke. The haze of bluish grey made the carriage feel more intimate and private. Remus began to relax for the first time in months, as if something inside of him was unclenching, slowly. He looked at Sirius, and thought \u2013\nwhy not?\n\u201cI found out some things, end of last term.\u201d He said, quietly, looking at his boots again.\nHe reached into his shirt pocket and withdrew the three newspaper clippings Ferox had given him last year. He handed them to Sirius, who reached through the smoke with long white fingers to receive them. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it yet.\u201d Remus said, quickly, \u201cBut read them if you like.\u201d\n\u201cOk,\u201d Sirius nodded, gently, \u201cThank you, Remus.\u201d"

            "content": "Remus\u2019s bad start to the year did not improve when the train drew into the station. They arrived in Hogsmeade with only twenty minutes or so until sunset, and Remus found Madam Pomfrey waiting for him, looking anxious.\n\u201cGood luck, Moony,\u201d Sirius said under his breath as they parted ways amidst the throng of excited black-robed students. Remus nodded grimly, and Sirius gave his shoulder a nudge with his own; a show of adolescent solidarity.\nRemus only had time to glance wistfully back as the three marauders climbed into one of the horseless carriages, one blond head, two dark \u2013 before Madam Pomfrey seized Remus by the elbow, and without warning apparated to the shrieking shack.\nThere was a blue and white plate sitting on the dusty mantelpiece with a thick chicken sandwich on top.\n\u201cIn case you\u2019re peckish,\u201d the nurse explained, \u201cYou\u2019ve still a bit of time.\u201d\nHe was starving hungry, but couldn\u2019t bring himself to eat it. Instead, he just sat down on his cot and waited to be locked in, wishing there was at least a bit of light in the dingy room. Remus thought about the feast \u2013 arguably his favourite part of the first night, other than sleeping in his big, comfortable bed. Neither would be happening tonight.\nHe could smell a rabbit outside, snuffing the grass, and his stomach gave a fierce growl. He looked at the sandwich again and considered it, but as pain shot through his shoulder blades he realised he had waited too long; the wolf was on its way.\n* * *\nMonday 2\nnd\nSeptember 1974\nOne might assume that a hungry werewolf would quite fancy a chicken sandwich, but apparently only raw meat would do, and Remus awoke to find that the little meal remained intact, while his arms and legs were ripped to shreds. He sighed heavily, hauled himself to his feet, and went to sit on the bunk again. His hip had gone funny for the third time, and his limp was exaggerated as he staggered across the room. His left shoulder felt dislocated \u2013 thank god it wasn\u2019t his right, because he had a lot of homework to catch up on.\nClosing his eyes, Remus slouched back against the wall to wait for Madam Pomfrey. It was dawn, and the marauders probably wouldn\u2019t be up for a few more hours, unless James decided he needed to squeeze some flying in before lessons. Remus knew that it was Harpreet Singh\u2019s final year at Hogwarts, which meant that the position of Quidditch Captain would be open next year, and James was not messing about.\n\u201c\nAccio sandwich\n,\u201d Remus rasped, finding his wand under the bed. The entire plate came flying towards him at such a speed that it hit the wall and shattered only inches away from his head. Groaning, Remus brushed away the shards of porcelain and began to pick hungrily at the stale bread.\nMadam Pomfrey soon arrived and set to work patching him up before accompanying him back to the castle. He insisted on walking, rather than having her conjure a stretcher.\n\u201cI\u2019m really not\nthat\nbad,\u201d he cajoled, \u201cYou\u2019ve done a great job on my shoulder\u2026 I reckon I\u2019m fine to go to lessons.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the look of that limp,\u201d she replied, \u201cHospital wing first, we\u2019ll see how you are at lunchtime.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s my first day\u2026\u201d he knew he was whinging, but he had to try.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Remus. Anyway, look at you, you\u2019re dead on your feet. A few hours\u2019 sleep and you\u2019ll feel much better.\u201d\nMuch to Madam Pomfrey\u2019s dismay, James, Peter and Sirius were waiting outside the hospital doors for Remus \u2013 meaning that sleep would have to be put off a little bit longer.\n\u201cHow\u2019d James get you two up this early?\u201d Remus grinned at them.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d James grinned back, Sirius stifling a yawn behind him. \u201cI had to resort to threats of violence.\u201d\n\u201cAnd actual violence,\u201d Peter said, rubbing his arm, which looked very red.\n\u201cYou ok, Moony?\u201d Sirius asked, blinking a lot as if to look more alert.\n\u201cFine, cheers,\u201d Remus nodded, as Pomfrey ushered him into the room.\nThe marauders waited patiently while Remus undressed behind a screen and climbed into his usual bed at the far end of the ward.\n\u201cFive minutes!\u201d Madam Pomfrey snapped, carrying over a sleeping draught, \u201cHe needs his rest, boys.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stay long anyway,\u201d James said, \u201cLessons and everything. We brought you your new timetable, Moony.\u201d He handed over the sheet.\nRemus studied it carefully. Ferox\u2019s lessons were at the end of the week, so at least he wasn\u2019t missing those. But he had McGonagall and Runes,\nand\nHistory today,\n\u201cCould you\u2014\u201d he started,\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get your homework, Moony, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Sirius said, amused. \u201cNice to see you back to normal.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus raised an eyebrow, stretching out a bare arm to display his fresh claw marks, \u201cCan\u2019t get much more normal than me.\u201d\n* * *\nHe did feel much better once he\u2019d slept the morning away. The anger which had torn him up for the past few months was still very present \u2013 but in some small way it had shifted, and he was able to think about other things. At Hogwarts, he felt better equipped to control his temper, he felt grounded and somewhat saner. As much as he didn\u2019t like to admit it to himself, Remus was beginning to feel more at home in the wizarding world than the muggle one.\nIn addition, he felt surprisingly positive about having given Sirius the newspaper clippings. They had been burning a hole in his pocket all summer, and he was glad to be rid of them; to let someone else in on the secret.\nPomfrey allowed him to leave for dinner, and he tried to slip into the Great Hall without too much fuss. This plan was scuppered, however, as he was rugby tackled by three very excitable girls,\n\u201cReeee-mus!\u201d They all shrieked, capturing him in a tight hug.\n\u201cHi!\u201d He gasped, trying not to wince as Marlene squeezed his freshly mended ribs.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t see you on the train!\u201d Mary said,\n\u201cAnd you weren\u2019t in Runes!\u201d Lily added,\n\u201cDid you have a good summer?\u201d Marlene asked, her voice slightly muffled under Mary\u2019s arm.\n\u201cYeah, great, thanks!\u201d Remus straightened his clothes as they finally released him, standing back and grinning at him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t feeling well, but I\u2019m ok now. How were your summers?\u201d\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Mary pulled him towards the Gryffindor table, where the marauders were watching on with a mix of amusement and envy. He shrugged at them, helplessly, as he was manhandled into a seat. \u201cWait til you hear what me and Darren did\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\nNot\nat dinner!\u201d Lily said, sounding exasperated, \u201cRemus doesn\u2019t want to hear what you got up to with your boyfriend!\u201d\nRemus\u2019s eyes widened \u2013 her certainly did\nnot\nwant to hear \u2013 and he flashed a grateful look at Lily, who smiled back.\nThe girls all looked a little bit different. Remus was so tall now that he hardly noticed other people growing, but Mary, Marlene and Lily definitely had. They looked less like the kids he remembered from first year, and now reminded him of the girls that Ste and his gang whistled at when they were out in town. Mary, particularly, had developed noticeable curves at some point, and Remus couldn\u2019t ignore the fact that half the boys on the Gryffindor table were staring at the way her white school shirt pulled across her chest.\n\u201cOi, ladies,\u201d Sirius called from further up the table, \u201cCan we have Moony back, please?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Mary replied, sticking out a pink tongue. She turned back to Remus, \u201cI really like your hair! Avni said she saw you on the train and you were dressed like a skinhead \u2013 you haven\u2019t actually joined a gang now, have you?\u201d\nRemus shrugged. Fortunately, the food appeared at that moment, providing a decent enough distraction. Unfortunately, girls were not like boys when it came to eating \u2013 while the marauders would have simply tucked in, heads down until they\u2019d finished, Lily and Marlene picked at their food slowly, chatting about school and who was going out with who, and their new favourite actors.\n\u201cMarlene fancies a Slytherin,\u201d Mary said, slyly.\n\u201cI do\nnot\n.\u201d Marlene turned bright red.\n\u201cYou do so, I saw you watching him in Potions!\u201d\n\u201cAre we doing Potions with Slytherin again, then?\u201d Remus asked, his stomach sinking.\n\u201cYep,\u201d Lily said, brightly. \u201cI think it\u2019s better, don\u2019t you? Slughorn always gives much more detail when his own house is in the classroom.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, I forgot,\u201d Mary cocked an eyebrow, \u201cLily has had a crush on a Slytherin for\nyears\n.\u201d\n\u201cSeverus is my friend.\u201d Lily replied, witheringly. \u201cYou\u2019re boy-mad, you.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it if I\u2019m more experienced than you lot,\u201d Mary raised her chin in a very dignified, mature sort of way. Marlene covered her ears dramatically,\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to start talking about Darren doing\u2026\nthat\nagain, then I\u2019m leaving!\u201d\n\u201cFine, fine,\u201d Mary laughed, lightly. \u201cI\u2019ll shut up.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t, though. She and Marlene ended up in a very intense debate over who was more attractive \u2013 David Essex or Donny Osmond. Remus took the opportunity to whisper to Lily,\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen Sniv\u2014Severus today, then?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, why?\u201d\n\u201cErm\u2026 did he say anything about\u2026 seeing me on the train?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lily sounded surprised, \u201cWhy? What happened?\u201d\n\u201cNothing!\u201d Remus said quickly, \u201cJust the usual, you know. Him being a prat.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d Lily replied, looking down at her food and playing with her fork. She seemed uncharacteristically nervous. \u201cHe can be a bit of a prat, I s\u2019pose.\u201d She looked up again, at Remus, and lowered her voice even further, so that he had to lean closer to hear her at all over the din of the dining hall,\n\u201cIt was just a theory lesson today, Potions,\u201d she whispered, \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to partner up. So\u2026 if you wanted to work together again this year?\u201d\n\u201cOh, you don\u2019t want to do it with Snape?\u201d\nLily looked very pink indeed and shook her head,\n\u201cNo, I think\u2026 well, you\u2019re a lot less bossy, and we study together so much anyway, I just thought.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sounds ok to me,\u201d Remus shrugged, returning to his food. He really was starving hungry. That pleased him, too \u2013 James and Sirius always paired up, so did Marlene and Mary.\nThere was Peter, of course, but he had lots of friends in Slytherin, and tended to make mistakes when he was anxious, which annoyed Remus, who was a perfectionist. Lily was a nice, sensible sort of girl with a sense of humour, and she could always explain things to him so that they sounded easy. Plus, it would drive James bonkers.\nThe Snape incident still bothered him, slightly. He had half expected McGonagall to be waiting to pounce as soon as he was discharged from the hospital wing \u2013 Severus almost always went running to a teacher, if he could get away with it. And Remus had been absolutely, 100% in the wrong this time, he knew that much \u2013 Snape hadn\u2019t so much as laid a hand on him, Remus had just humiliated him because he felt like it.\nAnd Snape did not like being humiliated. Remus didn\u2019t know much about the troubled Slytherin boy other than bits and pieces Lily had confided, but he\ndid\nknow that Severus Snape could hold a grudge like no one else. He would have his revenge, and if it wasn\u2019t by getting Remus into trouble with the teachers, then it was going to be something far more unpleasant.\n* * *\n\u201cSo, what were the girls talking about?\u201d James asked, once they were all in their dorm room for the evening. He was trying to sound casual, but Remus saw through it.\n\u201cOh, nothing interesting,\u201d he replied, unpacking his trunk, \u201cBoys, mostly, and snogging.\u201d\n\u201cSnogging?!\u201d Sirius sat up on his bed.\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Remus scrunched his face up to show his distaste for the topic, \u201cIt\u2019s all they\u2019re interested in, these days. Mary and her muggle boyfriend did something over the summer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did they do??\u201d Sirius looked very interested now \u2013 not disgusted at all, Remus realised.\n\u201cEr\u2026\u201d he faltered, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really know. Lily wouldn\u2019t let her talk about it while we were eating.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d James nodded, proudly, \u201cToo clever for all that nonsense, Lily.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know it\u2019s nonsense?\u201d Sirius asked. \u201cS\u2019not like you do any snogging.\u201d\n\u201cOh, and\nyou\ndo?!\u201d James frowned.\n\u201cCould if I wanted,\u201d Sirius said, lying down again, arms behind his head, \u201cPlenty of girls fancy me.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\nwanted\n,\u201d James smirked, \u201cSo, what, you\u2019ve got girls lining up for a cheeky snog and you\u2019re just\u2026 not interested?\u201d\nAn almost imperceptible look of panic crossed Sirius\u2019s face, only for the most fleeting of moments, before it returned to its usual impish cheek.\n\u201cJealous, are you, Potter?\u201d\n\u201cEugh, of you?!\u201d James teased back,\n\u201cBet\nLily\nfancies me\u2026\u201d Sirius said.\n\u201cTake that back!\u201d James roared, launching himself at his friend, wrestling him into a headlock.\nPeter sighed, heavily and looked at Remus,\n\u201cThey were like this all summer.\u201d He said, glumly, \u201cEverything\u2019s a competition.\u201d\n* * *\nSome hours later, Remus was just drifting off to sleep when his ears pricked, and he heard those familiar footsteps crossing the room. Shortly, his bed curtain twitched aside and Sirius whispered,\n\u201cMoony? You awake?\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\nSirius crawled inside. Remus sat up, nervously. Sirius had only ever paid him a visit once before \u2013 usually he went to James if he wanted to talk about\u2026 well, Remus didn\u2019t know what they talked about, but he assumed Black family drama. The only time Sirius had sought out Remus was early in their second year, just after the marauders had discovered he was a werewolf. Remus thought back to that night, occasionally, and the memory was tucked away in a safe, calm part of his mind. He remembered lifting his shirt so that Sirius could inspect his scars \u2013 long dark hair brushing his skin.\n\u201c\nMuffliato\n,\u201d Sirius whispered, casting the silencing spell.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Remus asked, rubbing his eyes as Sirius lit his wand.\n\u201cThe articles,\u201d Sirius said, pulling the clippings from his pyjama pocket. \u201cI read them.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Remus felt a trickle of shame run down his spine. \u201cRight.\u201d\n\u201cI know you said you didn\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d Sirius said, quickly, \u201cBut I just\u2026 well, I wanted you to know I\u2019ve read them, I s\u2019pose.\u201d\n\u201cOk, thanks.\u201d Remus nodded.\n\u201cAnd\u2026 I understand why you\u2019re angry.\u201d\n\u201cMm?\u201d\n\u201cAnyone would be,\u201d Sirius said, fervently, his eyes huge in the darkness, twin blue flames, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s just such a shitty hand to be dealt, Moony.\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t know what to say to that. He could hardly disagree.\n\u201cI won\u2019t tell James, or Pete,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cNot unless you want me to.\u201d\n\u201cNo, please don\u2019t.\u201d Remus said, \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 I\u2019m not ashamed, it\u2019s just\u2026 private, you know?\u201d\nSirius nodded, pursing his lips.\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe with me.\u201d\nRemus, still feeling a bit shaky, gave a weak smile,\n\u201cGod, you\u2019re so dramatic.\u201d\nSirius laughed too,\n\u201cJames\u2019s mum says I wear my heart on my sleeve.\u201d He nudged Remus with his toe, \u201cWe can\u2019t all be master secret-keepers like you, Moony.\u201d\n\u201cI thought I wasn\u2019t \u2018me\u2019 without secrets?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but if you\nhave\nto have them, I\u2019d rather\nI\nknew.\u201d\nRemus snorted,\n\u201c\u2019Cos you\u2019re so special, Black.\u201d\n\u201c\u2019Cos if I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll just try to figure it out anyway. Like you and your little cigarette selling enterprise.\u201d\nRemus\u2019s mouth dropped open,\n\u201cYou looked in my trunk! You wanker!\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you!\u201d Sirius replied, haughtily, \u201cI would never stoop so low. One of the sixth-year lads came \u2018round asking for you. See if you were still selling this year.\u201d\nRemus groaned, slapping his forehead,\n\u201cWas it Dirk Creswell? Bloody moron.\u201d\n\u201cHow much did you make?\u201d\n\u201cEnough. Please, don\u2019t tell James, you know what he\u2019s like about stealing\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou stole them?!\u201d\n\u201cBollocks.\u201d Remus groaned again at his own stupidity.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it, Moony,\u201d Sirius said, awed, \u201cBut you surprise me every time.\u201d"

            "content": "Remus never did find out exactly what is was Mary had done, or had had done to her over the summer holidays. Whatever it was though, it had given her a certain amount of status amongst the other girls in their year group which was hard to ignore.\nOn Thursday, their first lesson of the new term with Professor Ferox, Remus arrived at the classroom to find a cluster of girls whispering near his desk. He elbowed his way through, grumpily, reclaiming his work space next to Mary. The girls tittered and resumed whispering. Mary, of course, was at the centre of the group, holding court and \u2013 by the looks of it \u2013 having a thoroughly marvellous time. Marlene, sitting by, was watching on with a look of envy and respect.\n\u201cAnd it didn\u2019t hurt..?\u201d A Ravenclaw girl asked, in a hushed tone,\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s fine if you relax,\u201d Mary replied, with a bravado that reminded Remus of James.\n\u201cDo you think you\u2019re going to\u2026 you know\u2026 with Darren..?\u201d Another girl asked, her voice practically trembling with excitement,\n\u201cWell, I\u2026\u201d Mary started, but at that moment Professor Ferox emerged from his office, announcing his presence with a cheerful salutation,\n\u201cWelcome back, class! Seats, please!\u201d\nThe girls all hurried into place, some looking very red faced and others unable to stop giggling. Remus frowned, trying to ignore them, and sat facing the front, back straight. Ferox gave him a friendly smile and nod, and Remus nodded back, smiling uncontrollably.\nFerox had clearly had a fantastic summer \u2013 his fair hair was a shade brighter, no doubt bleached by the sun. It was longer, and he now wore it twisted back in a long, knotted tail. His face was even more weather-beaten, and his nose rather red and peeling slightly from sunburn. He\u2019d rolled up his sleeves, as usual, revealing sun browned arms and the odd burn mark.\n\u201cGood summer?\u201d He asked the class, who all nodded and murmured in the affirmative. He grinned and clapped his hands together, \u201cExcellent! I hope you all had a nice long rest, and you\u2019re ready to begin work on XXXX rated creatures this term! First, let\u2019s do a quick recap of last terms work, then see who\u2019s done their summer reading\u2026\u201d\nRemus himself had only just finished the reading that morning \u2013 and hadn\u2019t even started on the extra texts Ferox had lent him. He sorely regretted wasting the whole summer being reckless now, and had already had to plead with professor McGonagall to let him have an extra week on his Transfiguration notes. He suspected that she had only relented after a conversation with Madam Pomfrey, which made him feel guiltier still, as he knew he was capable of beating most of the class even after his very worst transformations.\n\u201cYou\u2019re being too tough on yourself,\u201d Sirius told him, as they were chased out of the common room the night before by prefects telling them to go to bed. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of the year \u2013 if you\u2019re going to fuck up, you may as well fuck up now.\u201d\nRemus had just glared at him,\n\u201cEasy for you to say! Some of us actually have to work for our grades! Plus it\u2019s OWLs next year! I can\u2019t drop my standards now!\u201d\n\u201cArgh, please don\u2019t mention OWLs,\u201d James said, coming between them quickly in a less than subtle attempt to prevent an argument, \u201cMcGonagall and Flitwick have already put the fear in me. And\nwhy\ndid we decide to do Divination?!\u201d\n\u201cI quite like Divination,\u201d Peter said, thoughtfully, dumping his pile of books, \u201cProphecies and that. It\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nonsense.\u201d Sirius gave the smallest marauder a withering look. \u201cYou only like it because you\u2019re good at Astronomy.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that,\u201d James said, slyly, changing into his pyjamas, \u201cNoticed that Pete\u2019s got a new partner this year?\u201d\n\u201cOhhh yes!\u201d Sirius smirked, \u201cThe divine Desdemona Lewis, of Ravenclaw!\u201d\nRemus glanced up at Peter in surprised and watched him turn a shocking shade of scarlet from his blue pyjama collar to the roots of his yellow hair.\n\u201cShut up.\u201d He mumbled, climbing into bed, \u201cShe\u2019s just a friend.\u201d\n\u201cJames,\u201d Sirius said, in a very solemn voice, \u201cWhat on earth are we going to do if Petey-boy here gets a proper snog before any of us?\u201d\n\u201cWell, your reputation would be in tatters, for one thing.\u201d James replied, in the same serious manner.\n\u201cWhat do I have, if not my reputation?\u201d Sirius grinned back, getting into bed himself.\nRemus huffed with disapproval, and pulled hard on his bedcurtains, returning to his book and hoping they all got the message. If they did, it didn\u2019t matter.\n\u201cOf course, if\nI\ngot a snog before you, that wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d James said, \u201c\nI\u2019m\non the quidditch team.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have my animal magnetism.\u201d Sirius replied.\nThere was a loud *fump* and an \u2018oi!\u2019, and Remus assumed that James\u2019s pillow had crossed the room and made contact with Sirius\u2019s head.\n\u201cI bet you\u2014\u201c James started,\n\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d Peter groaned, \u201cPlease don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 I bet you TEN GALLEONS that I can get a girl to snog me within a month.\u201d\n\u201cTen?!\u201d Peter gasped.\n\u201cDone!\u201d Sirius called back. \u201cJust you wait, Potter.\u201d\nRemus, who had lost all ability to concentrate on his book, huffed loudly again and decided to sleep. Pathetic. It wasn\u2019t just the girls any more, now even the marauders were obsessed with snogging. It probably would be Sirius who won the bet \u2013 though James had a fair point about the quidditch team.\nHe felt sorry for Peter, who had gone very quiet. Remus tried not to think about the fact that none of his friends had made any comment on\nhis\nlikeliness to get a snog. He must rank even lower than he thought.\nRemus was troubled by this all week, right up to his Care of Magical Creatures lesson, which he now found himself daydreaming through.\nAs Ferox\u2019s lecture drew to a close, Remus realised he had made no notes at all. He looked down, panicked, and saw a neatly folded piece of parchment. Who had put that there? He glanced around, furtively, then opened it.\n\nPlease tell Sirius I think he\u2019s gorgeous. Effie Scunthorpe x\n\nHeat flared up his neck as Remus screwed the note up into a ball and shoved it in his pocket. That settled it. Everyone had lost their minds.\n* * *\nAs well as contending with the raging hormones which now seemed to infect every one of Remus\u2019s social circles, there was another noticeable change in the atmosphere at Hogwarts. Even if James had not explained to him that the wizarding world was at war, Remus thought he would have worked it out for himself this year.\nThe Slytherins \u2013 who had always considered themselves a cut above the other houses, and had therefore maintained a certain distance \u2013 had retreated even further into themselves now. They gathered in huddles in the classrooms, kept to their common room and moved through the corridors in ominous groups. Muggleborn students were also travelling in packs, Remus had noticed, and the teachers seemed to be making their presence known more than they had in previous years.\nThis did not stop certain incidents from taking place, however. Anyone who was not a pureblood quickly became adept at defensive spells, and even the marauders had swapped pranks for protection.\n\u201cWhere are the bloody prefects when you need them?!\u201d James complained, having just fired off a few well-placed\nengorgio\ncharms at a group of sixth year Slytherins who were tormenting a first year Hufflepuff. The green robed teens were running away, now, clutching their various rapidly swelling extremities.\n\u201cI think even the prefects are scared,\u201d Sirius replied, leaning against the wall, looking bored as James helped the Hufflepuff to his feet. \u201cCowards.\u201d\n\u201cAll they can do is hand out detentions and take house points,\u201d Remus added, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think the Slytherins even care about those any more. I heard Mulciber last week saying that they should all put up with \u2018trivial punishments for the promise of a greater reward.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cMulciber said that?\u201d Sirius arched an eyebrow, \u201cBloody hell, he\u2019s more eloquent than I gave him credit for.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, or he\u2019s parroting back something someone else has told him,\u201d James countered, watching the Hufflepuff scurry away down towards the kitchens.\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you think the reward is?\u201d Pete asked, scuffing his toe on the flagstones.\n\u201cMoney? Power? Life eternal?\u201d Sirius sighed, rolling away from the wall and swaggering up the corridor. \u201cGodric knows. They won\u2019t get it, though.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cBecause, Petey-boy, we\u2019re going to\nwin\n.\u201d\n* * *\nBy the end of September, Snape had still not made his move. This put Remus somewhat on edge \u2013 and he wondered whether that was the intention. Their only shared lessons this year were Potions and Arithmancy. Arithmancy was fortunately a relatively quiet class, which mainly involved taking down notes and figuring out equations. Potions, being more practical, gave Snape (and the Slytherins as a whole) scope for much greater interference.\nAs they had agreed on the first day of term, Lily and Remus became partners, sharing a cauldron and dividing up notes and directions. This clearly infuriated Snape, who barely took his eyes off them the whole time. However, Remus had to admit that this appeared to have less to do with him than it did with Lily herself.\n\u201cHave you two fallen out or something?\u201d Remus asked, one afternoon as Severus shoved his way past to leave the dungeons. Lily sighed, wearily,\n\u201cNo, not exactly.\u201d She said. \u201cHe got annoyed when I had Mary and Marlene to visit over the summer, that\u2019s all. Thinks they\u2019re not the right \u2018sort\u2019. I have to keep reminding him that\nI\u2019m\nmuggleborn too.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you put up with it?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t, really,\u201d She replied, sounding sad, \u201cI always have a go at him when he spouts that pureblood nonsense, and sometimes I think he listens to me. But\u2026 well it\u2019s not easy for him, you know.\u201d\nJames was not making things easier; anyone could see that. He and Sirius had conveniently set up their own cauldron next to Remus and Lily\u2019s, and ever since they\u2019d made their bet James\u2019s pursuance of Lily had dialled up a notch.\nNow, James Potter was a true star on the quidditch pitch \u2013 that much could not be denied. He was elegant and graceful; he thought tactically and moved with simple subtlety.\nWhen it came to Lily, he was none of these things.\n\u201cGive us a snog, Evans!\u201d He tried, during their first lesson.\nLily was so appalled that she swished her wand fiercely through the air, upturning the contents of Potter\u2019s cauldron. He and Sirius were stained bright blue for an entire week.\nThe following week, undaunted, James tried again. This time he had consulted his father, who had suggested that he try complimenting the object of his affections.\n\u201cI really like your hair,\u201d he said, confidently, as soon as she approached the work bench.\n\u201cMm.\u201d She responded, not looking up.\n\u201cYeah it\u2019s so\u2026 um\u2026 ginger.\u201d\nRemus saw Lily\u2019s jaw tighten. She\nhated\nbeing called ginger \u2013 she\u2019d told him once that she\u2019d been teased for her hair in primary school. Remus took a step back, seeing Lily reach for her wand as she turned towards James with a false smile.\n\u201cLike it that much, do you?\u201d She asked. Sirius, who had been watching Remus, took a step back as well. Poor James was too excited to finally have her attention, and nodded vigorously,\n\u201cOh yeah, I think it\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\nRufusio\n!\u201d Lily whispered, pointing her wand at him.\nSirius guffawed so loudly that half of the class turned to look, and Remus had to cover his mouth to hide his own laugher. James\u2019s confusion made it even funnier, until Marlene handed him her compact mirror so that he could see his newly bright red hair.\nIt took forty-eight hours to wear off, but it was no good. Even after two full days of being called \u2018ginger nut\u2019 and \u2018carrot top\u2019 (among some slightly ruder nicknames) wherever he went, James remained completely unshaken in his adoration.\n\u201cJust got to be patient,\u201d he said, dreamily, running a hand through his messy auburn locks, \u201cNothing worth having isn\u2019t worth waiting for.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of impressive.\u201d Sirius whispered loudly to the others, \u201cI sort of don\u2019t want to win the bet, \u2018cos he\u2019s made it too easy.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d James snorted. \u201c\nThat\u2019s\nwhy.\u201d\n\u201cOh, suck it, copper knob.\u201d"

            "content": "When Lily\u2019s kisses were not forthcoming, James demanded that they extend the bet to last the whole year. Sirius, in turn, said that in that case it ought to be worth double the galleons, which turned Peter white. Remus once again registered his disapproval of the whole thing, and demanded that they count him out.\nHe had much better things to spend his time on \u2013 and would not be spending any more money than he needed to. The others would have to be happy with a chocolate frog each for Christmas, because he simply couldn\u2019t spare the cash. Remus knew that he would need every last knut the moment he turned seventeen, in order to begin his mission to find Greyback.\nHis investigation had so far been fruitless. He had gathered up as many old editions of the\nDaily\n\nProphet\nas possible, from the library and lying about the common room. Some of the more recent editions had articles which mentioned werewolf packs \u2013 but there was hardly any detail, and no names mentioned. In the end, Remus was forced to conclude that nobody really knew anything solid. He imagined werewolves were hard to find, especially if they were ordinary wizards most of the time.\nAsking Ferox seemed like the next most sensible course of action. The Care of Magical Creatures teacher had suggested that he knew more than he\u2019d initially revealed to Remus last term \u2013 only Remus hadn\u2019t had the presence of mind to ask, still reeling from the news that Ferox had worked for Lyall. He needed to work up the nerve before going back, however, and plan his questions carefully enough so that Ferox wouldn\u2019t suspect anything.\nOctober began and ended with a full moon that year, which seemed very unfair, especially as it meant Remus would miss the Halloween feast. Still, the weather was unseasonably warm, and the marauders spent most of their free time enjoying the grounds under a fair blue sky, surrounded by the golden reds and browns of the most beautiful autumn Remus could remember.\nOn weekends he would settle down in the quidditch stands with several books, parchment and a quill, and complete his homework and advance reading, occasionally glancing up to watch one of James\u2019s drills, or cheer on poor Peter, who often got stuck as the stand-in keeper. Sometimes Marlene practiced with them, which made the afternoons even more pleasant as Lily and Mary would inevitably pop by.\nSirius was unable to sit still at all during these sessions. He alternated between trying to focus on his homework, to hopping on his broom for a race with James, to scribbling down complex tactical plays he thought the Gryffindor team ought to use in their first game, scheduled for November.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to thrash Slytherin this year.\u201d He kept muttering. \u201cGot to show \u2018em.\u201d\nSlytherin had won the quidditch cup the year before, and it was an immensely sore point with the Gryffindors \u2013 particularly Sirius, as both Narcissa and Regulus had been on the winning team. This year it was only Regulus, who had replaced his older cousin as seeker. Remus only knew this from James; Sirius had mentioned nothing.\n\u201cYou need to lean into your broom more, when you take a swing,\u201d Sirius was telling Marlene, who had just sat down for a rest. She was red in the face, fair hair plastered to her damp temples, and not in the mood for Sirius\u2019s commentary.\n\u201cI hit the bludgers nine times out of ten.\u201d She replied, panting, \u201cTen times, in my best games. Even Mulciber can\u2019t manage that.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to be better than the competition,\u201d Sirius admonished, piously, \u201cYou\u2019ve only got yourself to beat.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Black, if you think you can do better, we\u2019re trying out for beaters on Tuesday.\u201d\n\u201cNah.\u201d He waved a hand, looking away. \u201cYou beat me, fair and square.\u201d\n\u201cTwo\nyears\nago.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t respond, and Marlene just shrugged, then staggered to her feet and headed back to the pitch, where James was calling for her.\nRemus had been reading his book throughout this exchange, and hadn\u2019t wanted to interfere. He shot a glance at Sirius, who was leaning forward on the barrier, his chin resting on his arms as he watched the practice. Peter made a decent save, and Sirius\u2019s eyes lit up. Remus bit his lip, and thought hard, before saying quietly,\n\u201cThere are\ntwo\nbeaters on a quidditch team, you know.\u201d\n\u201cBloody hell, Moony,\u201d Sirius replied sarcastically, not taking his eyes off the pitch, \u201cFour years and you\u2019ve finally learnt something about the game.\u201d\nRemus ignored that, only tutting under his breath.\n\u201cYou know your problem?\u201d\n\u201cDo tell.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re proud.\u201d\nSirius laughed.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. But I\u2019d make a shit beater, wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\nSirius went quiet again. Remus sighed, heavily, closing his book, packing it into his bag, \u201cLook, you\u2019re going to hate yourself later if you don\u2019t have another crack at it. You just going to sit here cheering James on for three more years?\u201d He stood up, \u201cI\u2019m freezing, off to the library. See you at dinner?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, see you Moony.\u201d\nThat Tuesday, Remus went along to watch the Gryffindor team trials, and said nothing when he saw Sirius arrive, broom in hand. He didn\u2019t even smile smugly, though he dearly wanted to. Two hours later, Gryffindor had their new beater, and Remus realised that he now had to share his dorm with two James\u2019s.\n-- Except for one very important difference \u2013 while Sirius was undoubtedly full of passion for the sport, he appeared to lack James\u2019s discipline. Particularly in the mornings.\n\u201cWakey wakey!\u201d James chanted, brightly, as he exited the bathroom, hair shining and wet \u2013 the only time it ever lay flat on his head. He pushed on his glasses and flicked his wand at Sirius\u2019s bed, drawing back the curtains.\nIt was a week after trials, and this scene was becoming commonplace. Remus was already awake, almost dressed for breakfast, planning to get in an hour\u2019s reading before lessons started. He was tying up his shoelaces as he watched James and Sirius begin their new morning routine.\nSirius, who was little more than a shapeless lump under the duvet, groaned like a disgruntled troll.\n\u201cPiss off, Potter,\u201d he hissed, burying his head under his pillow.\n\u201cYou wanted to be on the team, Sirius me ol\u2019 chum. C\u2019mon, up you get\u2026\nLeviocorpus\n!\u201d\nWith that, Sirius\u2019s body flew into the air, seemingly yanked by some invisible force, leaving him hanging upside down in mid-air while James laughed hysterically.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that worked! Been trying to do that since last Christmas.\u201d\n\u201cLet me down you wanker!\u201d\n\u201cBe nice!\u201d\n\u201cLet me down!\u201d\n\u201c\nFinite\n.\u201d\nSirius landed on the floor with a thud, and leapt up immediately, rubbing the arm he\u2019d landed on.\n\u201cBloody hell!\u201d He grinned at James, \u201cThat was amazing! Now let me do it to you.\u201d\n\u201cOk!\u201d\n* * *\nBodily levitation did not become a regular fixture of the fourth year boys\u2019 dorm, but trying to drag Sirius out of bed did.\n\u201cJust one day off a week, Potter, I\u2019m begging you!\u201d He groaned at the breakfast table, one early Sunday morning. He barely opened his eyes, his lolling head propped up on his elbow.\n\u201c\nYou\u2019re\nthe one who wants to destroy Slytherin.\u201d James replied, cheerily, buttering some toast and sliding it over to his friend. Sirius glanced down at the offering disdainfully and looked away, closing his eyes again. James sighed, \u201cNot just you, either. The whole school wants to see them beaten. Think of it as doing your bit for the war effort.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you were doing your bit by hexing them in the corridors.\u201d Remus said, helping himself to a slice of Sirius\u2019s toast.\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Sirius grunted, eyes still closed. \u201cAnd that can be done at a reasonable hour.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the only time we can fit practices in,\u201d James said, starting to sound a bit annoyed now, \u201cThere\u2019s no point going after dark, the pitch gets booked up in the evenings and lessons start at nine.\u201d\n\u201cEven if they started at twelve you\u2019d have trouble getting Sirius up.\u201d Peter said, mouth full of porridge.\n\u201cWe should get time turners.\u201d Sirius yawned, without a trace of humour, \u201cStudents who need their beauty sleep should be issued with them.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a time turner?\u201d Remus asked, taking Sirius\u2019s second slice of toast.\n\u201cTurns back time, obviously,\u201d Sirius said, scathingly.\n\u201cThey\u2019re illegal.\u201d James said, quickly, \u201cWithout ministry permission. And really, really dangerous.\u201d\n\u201c\nI\u2019m\ndangerous if I don\u2019t get enough sleep,\u201d Sirius grumbled.\n\u201cMatron used to make us all get up at six on weekends,\u201d Remus said, thoughtfully, swallowing the last of his toast. \u201cShe thought it was healthy, or something. One of the older boys got into her room once and fiddled with her alarm clock, though, and we got away with an extra two hours in bed every day for a week before she noticed.\u201d\n\u201cMuggles are ingenious.\u201d James chuckled. \u201cBut stay away from my alarm clock.\u201d\n\u201cMmm.\u201d Remus murmured, deep in thought. He could feel the beginnings of an idea coming on.\n\u201cOh no, we\u2019ve lost him.\u201d Sirius said, watching Remus. \u201cProbably daydreaming about nogtails and nifflers again \u2013 I swear Care of Magical Creatures is the only subject he cares about any more.\u201d\n\u201cLeave Moony alone and eat your breakfast.\u201d James castigated. \u201cI want you on the pitch in five minutes.\u201d\n\u201cFine\u2026\u201d Sirius sighed heavily, and looked down at his plate, \u201cOi! Where\u2019s my breakfast??\u201d\n\u201cGot to go,\u201d Remus said, suddenly standing up, \u201cLibrary. See you in Potions.\u201d\nEarly mornings were Remus\u2019s favourite times in the library \u2013 everything was so neat and tidy, and he usually had the place to himself. Very few students were in the mood to study first thing, but Remus had found that during certain phases of the moon he barely slept five hours a night anyway, and so he was a regular visitor.\nThe idea took a while to form properly, but he wanted it to be clear and complete before bringing it before the other marauders. Then at least it would be fully\nhis\nprank. Remus felt the need to make his mark on something this year. Everyone else seemed to be focussed on other things \u2013 the war, or quidditch, or \u2018the great snogging race\u2019, as Sirius had so eloquently dubbed it. They hadn\u2019t even tried to sneak to Honeyduke\u2019s once. Remus felt very strongly that the marauders needed a prank \u2013 and a big one.\nHe wasted half an hour researching complex and convoluted time spells; incantations to stop time, speed it up, slow it down, or even bend it. (He wasn\u2019t really sure how bending time worked, but it didn\u2019t sound pleasant, or within his scope of ability). Eventually, he came to the conclusion that he was overthinking it, as usual. This was not a magical problem \u2013 it was mechanical.\nBy the time the school day was about to begin, Remus had located the passage he needed in\nHogwarts: A History\n, and was satisfied that he\u2019d have a plan by the end of the week. \u00a0He left for Potions in a pretty good mood \u2013 one which was quickly shattered when he realised he was being followed.\nThe feeling of being watched had been pricking the back of his neck while he\u2019d been in the library, but as it was generally a quiet and solitary place anyway, he\u2019d put it down to an overactive imagination. And there was always the chance that Madam Pince was lurking behind him, standing guard over her precious books. By 8.45 the hallways were crowded with students hurrying to their lessons, chattering and giggling, hurriedly eating breakfasts on the go, or scribbling down last minute homework. Although this year Remus\u2019s policy had been never to travel alone, he was satisfied that it was busy enough and there were enough Gryffindors around to be safe.\nHowever, as he began to descend the first set of stairs leading to the dungeon, the prickling feeling returned once more. As a rule, Remus tried to ignore instincts like that \u2013 they belonged to the wolf, and he resented the intrusion. But he couldn\u2019t shake it, and reached for his wand, gripping it tight.\nFinally, only a corridor away from the Potions classroom, he made a deliberate wrong turn and darted behind a tapestry. He waited. Sure enough, only a few seconds later, Severus Snape peered around the corner, looking confused. Irritation boiled up in Remus\u2019s throat, and before he could think about it reasonably, he pointed his wand at the Slytherin and chanted,\n\u201c\nPetrificus\n\nTotalus\n!\u201d\nSnape went rigid, a look of surprise on his face that would have been comical, if Remus wasn\u2019t so angry. The black-haired boy fell to the ground, arms and legs straight as a board, completely paralysed. His beady black eyes stared around, frantically, as Remus stepped out from his hiding place. He gave him a kick \u2013 not\ntoo\nhard, and only in the shin \u2013 and smirked down at Severus.\n\u201cStop following me, you creep.\u201d He said. \u201cDidn\u2019t I warn you?\u201d\nSnape stared helplessly up at him, and Remus laughed before heading for Potions with a spring in his step."

God, I hope Gryffindor win, or he\u2019ll be in a right mood.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus agreed. He hadn\u2019t thought of that. He\u2019d planned to reveal his big prank plan on Sirius\u2019s birthday, in lieu of a proper gift. Now he wondered if he ought to buy something as well \u2013 though they weren\u2019t due in Hogsmeade for a few more weeks. He could always give Sirius a pack of cigarettes, but that seemed a bit cheap, especially as Sirius knew they were stolen.\n\n\nAndromeda had already sent some presents ahead, care of the Potters, and James had them hidden under his bed. More records, of course \u2013 Remus dearly hoped that one of them was the new Bowie LP,\n\n\nDiamond Dogs\n\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m off to the Owlery, need to send something to Darren,\u201d Mary said, as they left the classroom. \u201cComing, Marls?\u201d\n\n\nMarlene looked a bit put out, so Remus said quickly,\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to the library, if you want to get those notes?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, thanks Remus!\u201d\n\n\nThey said goodbye to Mary and began walking in the opposite direction together. Remus liked Marlene a lot \u2013 she was tall for a girl, and he didn\u2019t have to crane his neck to talk to her all the time. Other than her emotional outburst at the end of their third year, she was also very much a no-nonsense person, which Remus found very calming compared to Mary, who was always a lot of fun, but sometimes very full on.\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Marlene grinned at him, \u201cI love the girl, but there\u2019s only so many times I can proofread her dirty letters to Darren.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nDirty\n\n\nletters?!\u201d Remus gaped. Marlene laughed,\n\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s pretty horrendous. Hey, Remus, can I ask you something?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUm\u2026 does Sirius like me?\u201d\n\n\nRemus fought his initial reaction, which was one of despair. It felt as though he hadn\u2019t got through a week of the new year yet without having to listen to someone\u2019s romantic problems. Why did they all think\n\n\nhe\n\n\nwas the best person to talk to? When had he ever given the impression that he was even remotely interested?\n\n\n\u201cI dunno.\u201d He said, hoping he didn\u2019t sound too annoyed. \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d give me a straight answer,\u201d Marlene chuckled. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s just that he\u2019s been acting really weird around me during quidditch practice.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWeird?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, just comments and stuff. It\u2019s a bit annoying, really, I don\u2019t really fancy him as much as I used to \u2013 you know, he\u2019s such an attention seeker, he was always much more Mary\u2019s type.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat comments?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStuff about me giving him a kiss for luck, or something\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s his idea of flirting, or maybe it\u2019s a joke \u2013 you never know with James and Sirius, do you?\u201d\n\n\nIt suddenly dawned on Remus what was going on, and he was half angry, half embarrassed for Sirius.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Marlene said, stopping just outside the library, \u201cWhat\u2019s that face for?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUgh, Marlene, look, I\u2019m really sorry about this, but\u2026\u201d and he explained to her all about the bet.\n\n\nOk, yes, she was quite likely to tell Mary, and Mary was extremely likely to tell everyone else in their year \u2013 but that would serve the boys right, in Remus\u2019s opinion. He took a distinct pleasure in ruining Sirius\u2019s chances at winning the stupid bet. Fortunately, Marlene was a very sensible girl, and by the end of Remus\u2019s explanation she was giggling.\n\n\n\u201cIt makes so much sense!\u201d She said, wheezing, \u201cJames kept trying to stop Sirius talking to me and everything. Those boys! They\u2019re completely ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus grinned, relieved that someone else shared this opinion.\n\n\n\u201cOh great, now I can have some fun with it,\u201d Marlene smirked, as they entered the library, lowering their voices. She then added, a little wistfully, \u201cShame James hasn\u2019t tried it on. He might have a chance.\u201d\n\n\nRemus raised his eyebrows.\n\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s only got eyes for Lily, so.\u201d\n\n\nMarlene sighed,\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a losing battle. Still, never mind.\u201d\n\n\nThey settled down at their favourite desk, which was near to the biggest window and provided some nice natural light. Remus pulled out his notes and showed Marlene how he\u2019d listed all of the qualities of thunderbirds, then phoenixes, then how he\u2019d begun to compare the two. Grateful for his help, Marlene offered up her Astronomy notes, and the two of them spent a companionable hour scribbling away. Eventually it was time for dinner.\n\n\n\u201cRemus,\u201d Marlene said, quietly, as they finished up, \u201cAre all of the marauders in on this bet, or just James and Sirius?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 I think Peter\u2019s doing it. He might regret it a bit now, though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d He replied, a little bit more loudly than he meant to.\n\n\n\u201cShame,\u201d she replied, her eyes twinkling, \u201cBecause I bet you could win.\u201d\n\n\nHe snorted,\n\n\n\u201cAs if.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGirls like you! You\u2019re really nice, and kind, and clever.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d snog you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh my god, Marlene\u2026\u201d Remus started walking a bit faster, his ears feeling very hot, \u201cYou\u2019re my friend!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, but just to win the bet.\u201d She grinned, matching his pace. He forgot how athletic she was, and he still had a dodgy hip. \u201cIsn\u2019t there anyone you fancy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo. C\u2019mon, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a lie, Remus thought to himself. It sort of felt like one, though.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\u201cGO GO GRYFFINDOR GO GO!\u201d Remus chanted along with everyone else. Having Peter wildly waving his scarf over his head like a lunatic with a knitted lasso helped mitigate any embarrassment Remus might have felt for himself.\n\n\nHe was nervous, though; more nervous than he had been for James and Marlene\u2019s first game; because Sirius - while of course very good at flying - did not always make the best decisions under pressure. And quidditch was a dangerous sport, if you were reckless.\n\n\nHalf of the crowd was decked out in blue, the other half in scarlet, and a deafening cacophony of boos and cheers erupted as the two teams walked onto the pitch. James was visible as ever with his wild mess of hair, and from a distance the two Gryffindor beaters were the same height, distinguishable only by their different coloured ponytails poking out under their helmets - one flaxen, one black.\n\n\nRemus felt his heart in his mouth as the players mounted their brooms, squatted slightly, then launched into the air at the blow of the whistle. It was hard to know who to follow, as James zipped up and down the pitch like a lightning bolt in pursuit of the quaffle, while Marlene and Sirius split off, covering different ends of the pitch, bats aloft.\n\n\nThe two beaters had very different styles - Marlene was focussed, and tended to tail the players rather than the bludgers in order to better protect her teammates. Sirius favoured a different tact - going directly after the offending balls no matter where they were, and knocking them as far away from the game as possible.\n\n\n\u201cThis is Black\u2019s first game and he\u2019s obviously throwing himself into it,\u201d The commentator\u2019s voice echoed over the crowds, \u201cHe\u2019s no doubt received plenty of coaching from Potter - who\u2019s just scored the first goal! That\u2019s Gryffindor in the lead with ten points!\u201d\n\n\nRemus was too anxious to cheer along with everyone else, getting dizzy trying to follow all three of his friends in the air.\n\n\n\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d the commentator, a seventh year Hufflepuff, continued, \u201cLots of talent on the Gryffindor side this year - Potter, of course, and McKinnon, who\u2019s one of the best beaters the reds have had in years, and now Sirius Black, the black sheep of a bonafide quidditch dynasty - you\u2019ll remember his cousin, Narcissa Black of Slytherin, one of the finest seekers Hogwarts has ever seen, and of course the younger Black brother, Regulus, who has taken Narcissa\u2019s place after a season as chaser. Rumour has is that there\u2019s bad blood in the Black clan, so you can bet that the Gryffindor/Slytherin match next term is going to be--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you will please focus on the game currently in progress, Miss Darcy!\u201d McGonagall snapped over the megaphone.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, professor! So that\u2019s Dunelm of Ravenclaw in possession of the quaffle, she shoots, she---oooh, and it\u2019s a bad miss\u2026\u201d\n\n\nThe game went on, and Remus hoped that Sirius hadn\u2019t been listening to the commentary - bringing up the Black family was a surefire way to break his concentration. But no, all seemed well - he was hitting the bludgers with a bit more vigour, but that could just have easily been adrenaline.\n\n\nBy the end of the game, it became evident that Remus\u2019s concerns were for nothing. Sirius may not act as though he took quidditch seriously off the pitch, but clearly having a cheering audience did wonders for his concentration.\n\n\nOnce the Gryffindor seeker caught the snitch - ending the match on 300 - 110 in Gryffindor\u2019s favour, the two beaters flew to the ground. Remus saw Sirius throw a gallant arm around Marlene\u2019s shoulders, and lean in - only to be dodged deftly as she offered her cheek for him to kiss.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThe common room was a riot of red, gold and rock music that evening. The whole house came out to celebrate both Gryffindor\u2019s victory and Sirius\u2019s birthday. Remus, for what it was worth, sold more cigarettes than he had all year so far - he had come prepared, assuming correctly that the older students would be drinking, making them more inclined to pay up for a hit of nicotine. He himself stayed away from any suspicious looking drinks, remembering his hellish hangovers from the summer.\n\n\nSirius and James were in their element, of course, roaring with laughter and soaking up the congratulations from their classmates. Peter hung about close enough to enjoy the limelight, but not so close as to get in the way.\n\n\nRemus was happy to watch at a distance, chatting with Lily and Mary and enjoying the snacks brought up from the kitchens. He knew he would not get a chance to divulge his plan until much later, now, but that was ok. Better for everyone to enjoy themselves, there was plenty of time yet.\n\n\nAt some point, Sirius finally got around to opening his presents - a broom repair kit from James, a lot of chocolate from Peter, and from Andromeda no less than three brand new albums;\n\n\nDark Side of the Moon\n\n\n,\n\n\nCountry Life\n\n\n(which had an incredibly rude cover that all of the boys smirked passed around, and made Remus want to die of embarrassment), and\n\n\nDiamond Dogs\n\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Remus said, unable to contain his excitement as he held the much awaited record in his hands, stroking the bizarre, nightmarish artwork. \u201cPut this one on first? Please?\u201d\n\n\nSirius grinned,\n\n\n\u201cAnything for you, Moony!\u201d And settled the disk into place on the turntable.\n\n\n\nOwww ooooooohhhhh\u2026\n\n\n\nThe record player howled, sending a shiver of shock down Remus\u2019s spine - the cry of a wolf. He stared up at James and Sirius in alarm. They looked just as surprised as he, though Sirius broke into a smile as David Bowie\u2019s voice filled the room, as if speaking an incantation:\n\n\n\nAnd in the death...\n\n\n\n\nAs the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy thoroughfare,\n\n\n\n\nThe shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building,\n\n\n\n\nHigh on Poacher's Hill,\n\n\n\n\nAnd red, mutant eyes gaze down on Hunger City\u2026\n\n\n\nThe whole common room was uncomfortably quiet as this grim, ugly poem was recited, not quite sure where to look as dogs howled and whined in the background. It made Remus feel dark and dirty - but he thought he liked it; as if Bowie was speaking directly to him. Especially as the final lines were yelled out:\n\n\n\n\"This ain't Rock'n'Roll!\n\n\n\n\nThis is genocide!\"\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\u201cA whole month?!\u201d Sirius whispered loudly.\n\n\n\u201cThirty days, yep.\u201d James replied, in the same stage whisper, \u201cIf we do it over the summer\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou forgot the silencing spell, idiots.\u201d Remus called out.\n\n\n\u201cBugger.\u201d Lots of rustling.\n\n\nIt was well past midnight on the day of Sirius\u2019s birthday, and the party had long since been broken up by the prefects. The marauders had climbed the stairs to bed sleepy and excitable, but apparently James and Sirius had had a second wind and were now in private conference in James\u2019s bed. Remus had a pretty good idea what they were talking about, but had decided to leave them be for now. See how far they took it. Still, he knew they\u2019d realise they\u2019d forgotten the spell eventually, and decided honesty was the best policy.\n\n\nRemus and Sirius poked their heads out from behind their respective curtains at the same time.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, Moony.\u201d Sirius grinned, \u201cDid we wake you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d Remus shrugged, \u201cI was\u2026 actually, I was thinking about this prank\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPrank?!\u201d James\u2019s head joined Sirius\u2019s in the gap between the curtains, \u201cWho said prank?!\u201d\n\n\nRemus smiled, shyly. He\u2019d thought he might have to wait until next weekend to tell them, but James magnanimously opened the bed curtains further, \u201cPlease, Mr Moony,\u201d he said, \u201cStep into our office\u2026\u201d\n\n\nEagerly, Remus scrambled out from his tangle of bedsheets and padded barefoot across the chilly bedroom floor into James\u2019s bed. He felt as though he\u2019d been waiting four years for an invite.\n\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d James asked, seriously, pointing his wand light at Remus like a microphone. \u201cTell us!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust a second,\u201d Remus rolled his eyes, withdrawing his own wand, \u201c\n\n\nMuffliato!\n\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s too clever for us.\u201d Sirius said, dryly.\n\n\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d James agreed.\n\n\nRemus ignored them; they were jumpy and silly from lack of sleep, he had to at least give them the gist of his plan before they finally crashed.\n\n\n\u201cRemember how I was telling you about Matron\u2019s alarm clock?\u201d He asked them, quickly. The boys nodded obediently like cocker spaniels. \u201cAnd how we used to fiddle with it so we didn\u2019t have to get up early anymore?\u201d More nodding, \u201cWell, I was thinking about how it could be applied to Hogwarts. I did some research, and - did you know that all of the clocks at this school are controlled by one master clock? The big one outside the Great Hall.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh MOONY!\u201d Sirius cried, suddenly throwing himself at Remus, flinging his arms around him with such force that they both toppled backwards on the bed. Startled, Remus tried to push him away, but Sirius held fast, pretending to sob onto his shoulder with joy, \u201cYou\u2019ve READ\n\n\nHogwarts: A History\n\n\n! One of you has\n\n\nfinally\n\n\nread it! You\u2019re now my favourite marauder!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGerroff, tosser!\u201d Remus growled, finally forcing him off and shuffling further away on the bed, James laughing at them both.\n\n\n\u201cNo one would ever guess you\u2019re the oldest, Black,\u201d James grinned. \u201cMoony, please continue. The big clock\u2026?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight, yeah,\u201d Remus straightened his night shirt, feeling very hot and flushed from the assault, \u201cErr\u2026 so\u2026 um\u2026 I had this idea\u2026 I\u2026\u201d It was no good, he\u2019d completely lost his train of thought, now all he could think about was what an irritating idiot Sirius was.\n\n\n\u201cThe big clock controls all the others,\u201d Sirius filled in, quickly, remarkably lucid now, \u201cIt\u2019s a spell that makes sure every clock and watch in the castle is perfectly synchronised. Even the ones we bring from home re-set - even\n\n\nmuggle\n\n\nclocks. It\u2019s a bloody good bit of magic.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus nodded, getting back into the flow, \u201cYeah, exactly. So I\u2019m thinking; if that clock goes wrong, or gets moved by five minutes - then so do all the others. And it would affect lesson times, and meals, and\u2026 well, pretty much the whole running of the castle. And if we started off\n\n\nreally\n\n\nslowly - say, moving it forward five minutes a night - no one would notice for ages, would they? I mean, how\n\n\ncould\n\n\nanyone notice, if all the clocks are the same?\u201d\n\n\nHe finished, sitting back and looking at James, because he was still annoyed with Sirius for flustering him and almost spoiling it. James\u2019s brain was working at warp speed - Remus knew this because he had pushed his glasses back on his nose. Finally, he looked at Sirius and smiled.\n\n\n\u201cOur Moony\u2019s done it again!\u201d"

            "content": "Monday 4th November 1974\n\u201cI dunno.\u201d Peter said, wringing his hands again. \u201cProfessor McGonagall says we shouldn't mess about with time.\u201d\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be,\u201d Sirius groaned, having already explained the plan twice. \u201cThis is a muggle prank, Peter, get it through your thick skull!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Remus frowned, feeling sorry for Peter, who had been sulking all day anyway because he\u2019d been left out of their night time planning. \u201cWe\u2019re not messing about with time, Pete,\u201d Remus explained kindly, \u201cWe\u2019re just messing about with clocks.\u201d\nPeter looked at Remus, then at James for confirmation.\n\u201cOk.\u201d He said, slowly. \u201cI think I get it.\u201d\nThey\u2019d agreed to do it as soon as possible, and struggled to get through their lessons that day with the mounting anticipation for their devious scheme. Remus had to shush James and Sirius more than once when their excitement got the better of them - they were hardly subtle at the best of times.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t work if anyone else knows about it.\u201d Remus hissed at lunch when Mary asked what they were whispering about. \u201cSo shut up! I\nknow\nyou lot can keep a secret if you really try.\u201d\nThey could hardly wait for night to fall and the castle to grow still and quiet. It had been a long time since they\u2019d all been out of bounds together after dark, and even though it was a very simple task, all them wanted to go.\nThere was one problem. It was much more difficult to get all four of them under the cloak than it had been three years ago.\n\u201cPeter, you stay here.\u201d Sirius said, after their third attempt.\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d Peter protested, \u201cWhy am I always the one left out?!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not leaving you out, idiot, this is purely a logistical concern.\u201d Sirius rolled his eyes.\n\u201cJames!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay,\u201d Remus offered. \u201cI\u2019m the tallest, it\u2019s my fault.\u201d\n\u201cBut it was your idea,\u201d Sirius whined, \u201cYou can\u2019t miss out!\u201d\nRemus shrugged,\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be lots of times. We\u2019re doing this more than once.\u201d\n\u201cEven with three it\u2019s a squeeze.\u201d James said. \u201cBlack, Pettigrew, sit this one out.\u201d\n\u201cWhy me?!\u201d Sirius and Peter both cried at the same time.\n\u201cBecause.\u201d James\u2019s said, lips curling, \u201cIt\u2019s Moony\u2019s idea and\nmy\ncloak.\u201d\nIt took a little more squabbling, ego massaging and many promises that every night they would take it in turns, just to be fair, before the two rejected marauders conceded. Soon afterwards, Remus and James were creeping through Gryffindor common room under the cloak, tiptoeing past a few sleeping seventh years lying unconscious on their NEWT textbooks.\n\u201cHopefully they\u2019ll stop squabbling if we give them an hour alone.\u201d James whispered, as they left the portrait hole and entered the dark empty corridor.\n\u201cWhy is Sirius being such a dickhead to Peter, anyway?\u201d Remus asked his own voice as low as possible. They didn\u2019t want to disturb Peeves - or even worse, Mrs Norris.\n\u201cAll the girls know about the Great Snogging Race,\u201d James replied, moving slowly so that Remus could keep pace, \u201cSirius thinks Pete told them.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would he think that?\u201d\n\u201cYou know Black,\u201d James said with a smile in his voice, \u201cLoves jumping to conclusions. Usually the wrong ones.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think it was Peter, then?\u201d Remus asked, innocently,\n\u201cMoony.\u201d James snorted, \u201cI know it was you.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d James laughed, quietly, \u201cIf anything it\u2019s improved my chances of winning the bet.\u201d\n\u201cMarlene offered to snog me,\u201d Remus said, suddenly, \u201cBut I told her I wasn\u2019t in the bet.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t sure why he\u2019d chosen to tell James - or why he\u2019d picked such an inopportune moment to do so. He supposed he just wanted somebody to know. Maybe it was a boasting thing - they were the ones who hadn\u2019t included him in the running in the first place.\n\u201cHa,\u201d James said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell Sirius, he\u2019ll never get over it.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019d snog you.\u201d Remus added, charitably, \u201cShe told me she would.\u201d\n\u201cAlas, it\u2019s not to be,\u201d James replied, casually. Remus was thoughtful for a little while, but they\u2019d reached the clock now, at the bottom of the grand staircase.\nIt was very big and very beautiful, with a vast mahogany frame carved with various magical creatures and plants, the face and hands cast in shimmering gold.\nRemus pulled out his wand and concentrated carefully on unbinding the protective charms placed there by a great wizard long ago. It took a long time; they were complex and intricate, braided together fine as lace. But slowly and surely, one by one, he felt the magic unfasten with a gentle pop somewhere in his midsection. He smiled at James.\n\u201cThere we go.\u201d\nJames waved his own wand at the clock, and the longer hand rolled backwards five minutes. He looked down at his own watch, and they both saw it synchronise. James chuckled under his breath.\n\u201cSee Moony, I knew it had to be you. C\u2019mon, better get back.\u201d\nThey crept back up the stairs, quicker now, giddy with triumph. At the top, Remus had to pause for breath for a moment. He rested a hand on James\u2019s shoulder to steady himself, and the other boy waited patiently.\n\u201cHey, James?\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cAre you really going to lose the bet to Sirius for Lily\u2019s sake?\u201d\nJames\u2019s back stiffened slightly, but he didn\u2019t sound annoyed.\n\u201cMight not lose.\u201d\n\u201cBut Lily\u2019s never going to--\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the one taking Divination, Lupin, not you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but she hates you.\u201d\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t hate me.\u201d James chucked. \u201cLily Evans doesn\u2019t have a hateful bone in her body.\u201d\nRemus said nothing to this, knowing it was quite true. James continued, \u201cIt\u2019s just not time yet, that\u2019s all. But I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Remus said. It struck him for the first time that James didn\u2019t simply\nfancy\nLily. It was something else altogether. Remus wanted to ask more questions, but he didn\u2019t know how - he wasn\u2019t Sirius, he couldn\u2019t be that brazen.\nWhen they got back to the bedroom, Sirius was pacing the floor, and the curtains were drawn around Peter\u2019s bed. It could be assumed that they had not used the time to settle their differences.\n\u201cWell?\u201d Sirius barked, eagerly, as James and Remus threw off the clock.\n\u201cDone.\u201d James said, simply, yawning and heading for his own bed. He patted Sirius on the shoulder as he passed him, \u201cEnjoy your five minute lie in.\u201d\n* * *\nAnd so the prank went on. Every night that week, two marauders would creep downstairs under the invisibility cloak and perform the spell to move that minute hand back by five degrees, so that by Saturday morning, every clock at Hogwarts was running twenty-five minutes late. So far, no one seemed to have noticed, and James and Sirius were getting restless.\n\u201cThe thing is,\u201d Sirius yawned over breakfast, sleepy eyed in his rumpled quidditch kit. \u201cWe\u2019re not actually getting an extra half-hour\u2019s sleep, are we? We\u2019re not going to\nbed\nany earlier.\u201d\n\u201cNo, well that wasn\u2019t actually the intention\u2026\u201d Remus said, attempting to construct a marmalade and strawberry jam toast sandwich.\n\u201cStill, I think we ought to be getting something out of it.\u201d\n\u201cThe satisfaction of a job well done?\u201d Remus responded, dryly, before biting into his creation. Sweet fruit jelly oozed from between the crusts, getting all over his fingers. Sirius grimaced - he had an aversion to sticky things.\nThe brilliance of their own genius was apparently not enough for Sirius, however. The next morning Remus woke up long before his alarm rang, and when he checked his bedside clock he saw that it was apparently still 7am. He went over and shook Sirius.\n\u201cWhat did you do last night?\u201d Remus asked, once Sirius finally woke up, \u201cYou and James did the clock, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cFancied a bit more of a lie in, that\u2019s all\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHow much did you move it by?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, hour or two?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cWhat??\u201d Sirius looked genuinely surprised. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the whole point of the prank?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Remus sighed. What was the point? It couldn\u2019t go on forever, anyway. \u201cThat\u2019s still too much. I\u2019m going to go and see if I can turn it forward a little bit tonight.\u201d\nSirius shrugged, rolled over and went back to sleep.\nA few people commented on how odd it was to wake up in broad daylight in the winter at seven o\u2019clock in the morning, but as it was a Sunday anyway Remus thought they\u2019d got away with it. That evening, Remus and Peter crept downstairs as usual, and Remus tried to correct Sirius\u2019s recklessness.\n\u201cCan we make it so that we get up earlier next Saturday?\u201d Peter asked, uncertainly - Remus still wasn\u2019t sure that Peter fully understood what they were doing.\n\u201cDon\u2019t see why not,\u201d Remus shrugged. \u201cWhy do you want to get up early though?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Hogsmeade weekend and I was going to meet\u2026 um\u2026 no, nothing.\u201d\n\u201cWho??\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell James or Sirius!\u201d\n\u201cWho, Pete?\u201d\n\u201cDesdemona Lewis.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026 No, I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\nRemus went to bed with a heavy heart that night. He felt he had lost every one of his friends now - the only one who didn\u2019t constantly want to talk about their relations with the opposite sex was Lily. And he felt a bit guilty around Lily, since inadvertently ruining their Potions project.\nTo be fair, everyone\u2019s in the class had been ruined;\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d Professor Slughorn had scratched his head, completely confounded by the useless girding potions everyone had produced. \u201cDid everybody leave them to brew for the correct amount of time? It must be precisely twenty-four hours\u2026\u201d\nEveryone had, of course. Or thought they had. It was really Sirius\u2019s fault, Remus told himself.\nSirius, of course, found the entire episode immensely amusing, and it only inspired him to take even greater risks. The problem was, Remus couldn\u2019t catch him at it. Every time it was Sirius\u2019s turn to go down and change the clocks, he made sure he was going with either Peter or James. And whenever Remus volunteered to go, Sirius took a step back.\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Remus told him, when they woke up one \u2018morning\u2019 with the sun already at its\u2019 highest point in the sky.\n\u201cAnd I know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Sirius replied with a grin, \u201cGoody two-shoes.\u201d\nIt was true - Remus was going down every second night and trying to fix whatever havoc Sirius had caused, so that by the third week of November the clocks were all swinging wildly this way and that, sometimes altered by as much as four hours. The main problem was that Sirius wouldn\u2019t tell him how much he was changing the time by, so Remus was having to guess at his corrections.\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on?!\u201d Mary said, one morning at breakfast, after perhaps only four hours sleep - Remus regretted that, but it had been the only way to reclaim ground in Sirius\u2019s ridiculous tug of war.\nBreakfast had become a very odd event - it seemed that the house elves in the kitchen were more confused than anyone else about the time of day, and were in disagreement over which meal they ought to be serving. As such, scrambled eggs were being served alongside mashed potato and gravy; legs of lamb accompanied cornflakes, and once or twice everyone had arrived for dinner and nothing at all had appeared. Sirius and James were loving every minute of this, of course.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d James asked, nonchalantly. Sirius was not speaking that morning, only yawning and occasionally scowling at Remus.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t anyone else sleeping really badly?\u201d Mary asked, desperately. She was starting to look quite frazzled - her dark hair was coming out of her braids in thick corkscrews, and her eyes were slightly bloodshot. \u201cAnd what\u2019s up with the weather?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it was really dark yesterday,\u201d Marlene yawned, \u201cBut today it started getting light at six or something.\u201d\n\u201cHogwarts is a very mysterious and magical place.\u201d James said. \u201cWho are we to question its inner workings?\u201d\nMeanwhile, Remus was very concerned about the upcoming full moon. He thought it was due soon, anyway, he couldn\u2019t really be sure. If Sirius didn\u2019t slow down, he might lose track altogether and just have to lock himself in the shrieking shack for a week. He didn\u2019t know how to explain that to Madam Pomfrey - but if he didn\u2019t do something then he ran the risk of transforming somewhere in the castle.\n* * *\nWednesday 27th November 1974\nBy the fourth week, Remus didn\u2019t think that any of the marauders knew what on earth the time was supposed to be - even in the vaguest sense. He\u2019d given up trying to correct Sirius at all, and instead thought it best to just let things play out. Things finally came to a head when, while yawning their way through a Transfiguration lesson, Peter suddenly looked out of the window with a gasp.\n\u201cWhat is it, Pettigrew?\u201d McGonagall snapped - she had been much more irritable than usual. Actually, everyone had, and Remus resolved never to muck up anyone\u2019s sleep pattern again.\n\u201cN-nothing, Professor.\u201d Peter looked down, hurriedly.\nBut it was too late; the whole class, including McGonagall, was now staring out of the window too - and watching the sun rise at eleven o\u2019clock in the morning.\n\u201cOh for goodness sake!\u201d McGonagall said. \u201cClass, I want all of you in the Great Hall at once. I\u2019m getting the Headmaster.\u201d\nLess than an hour later, Remus was feeling extremely nervous surrounded by the rest of the school as they waited for Dumbledore to address them. He hadn\u2019t seen much of the head teacher that year; the old man was often absent from meals now, and McGonagall had said he was simply out on business for the ministry. Still, he was here now, and Remus couldn\u2019t stop the sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach as the white haired wizard approached the lectern.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, d\u2019you think?\u201d Lily asked Remus. Mary was snoozing on her shoulder.\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d he replied, hoping he sounded convincing.\n\u201cIt seems,\u201d Dumbledore began. He spoke very softly for a teacher, Remus had always thought - but somehow everyone fell quiet anyway. \u201cThat we have some pranksters in our midst.\u201d\nAt once, everyone in the room turned to look at Remus, Sirius, James and Peter. Remus kept staring ahead, ignoring them; Peter began to shake his knee anxiously, glancing at James, who smiled back at his audience in an affable manner. Remus couldn\u2019t see what Sirius was doing, but it was sure to be ridiculous and highly disrespectful. Still, Dumbledore made no accusations, only smiled pleasantly and continued, \u201cRest assured that the clocks are now being corrected, and measures taken to ensure that this cannot happen again. In the meantime, I think we could all do with a bit of rest - I am cancelling the rest of today\u2019s classes, to be resumed at our usual - and correct - time tomorrow morning.\u201d\nThere was a collective murmur of appreciation at this news.\n\u201cYes!\u201d Sirius hissed, \u201cResult!\u201d\n\u201cNow,\u201d Dumbledore raised his arms, \u201cOff you go, use this time wisely!\u201d\nEveryone in the hall got to their feet and began to trudge wearily towards the doors. The marauders were just about to follow suit, when McGonagall appeared behind them, placing a hand on Sirius and James\u2019s shoulders.\n\u201cWait.\u201d She said. \u201cNot you four.\u201d\nRemus gulped, as the rest of the school vacated the room, until it was just the four of them, Dumbledore and McGonagall.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Dumbledore smiled, kindly, \u201cWhich one of you came up with the idea, eh? Or was it a collective effort?\u201d\nThe four boys looked at each other, then down at their laps. Dumbledore chuckled, \u201cAdmirable.\u201d He said, approvingly, \u201cThen we shall have to treat you all equally, hm? I think ten points each from Gryffindor, do you agree, Professor McGonagall.\u201d\n\u201cAt the very least!\u201d She nodded, \u201cAnd detentions!\u201d\n\u201cI shall leave that in your capable hands, then. Just one thing, boys.\u201d\nThey all looked up, wincing as they braced themselves for the telling off.\n\u201cYou\u2019re all clearly very gifted wizards,\u201d Dumbledore continued to smile. Peter gave an odd sort of squeak. \u201cThat much is clear. It was a simple spell, yes, but highly effective. That kind of thinking will take you far. But perhaps a little more forethought and planning next time? You might not have been discovered quite so quickly.\u201d\n\u201cThree weeks isn\u2019t bad!\u201d Sirius blurted out. James kicked him, but Dumbledore laughed. McGonagall turned red with anger,\n\u201cThen it shall be three weeks detention, Black!\u201d\nSirius quickly bowed his head, and James muttered under his breath,\n\u201cIdiot.\u201d"

Poor Miss Lewis would have to wait.\nThis also meant that Remus wouldn\u2019t be able to buy any Christmas presents for his friends, but he was grateful for that excuse. He had so far amounted a small fortune (in his eyes, anyway) of ten galleons and twelve sickles. It wasn\u2019t anywhere near James\u2019s inheritance, of course, or even Sirius\u2019s bequeathal from his uncle - but it was more than Remus had ever had, even in muggle money.\nHe\u2019d already started making plans for the moment he turned seventeen. Learning how to apparate was key - he had to be sure to get that right. Then, he would buy enough supplies and begin his search. And he thought he knew where to start.\nThis term, ever since he had been back at Hogwarts, Remus had been reading\nThe Daily Prophet\ncover to cover. He borrowed James\u2019s copy, and made notes privately - usually in the library, where the other marauders wouldn\u2019t bother him. He was looking for anything; attacks, sightings, rumours. Anything related to werewolves or \u2018unidentified dark creatures\u2019. There was very little in there - James maintained that this was because the ministry didn\u2019t want to frighten anyone.\nBut there were still clues. Sometimes there were stories about Aurors breaking up \u2018illegal gatherings\u2019 or meetings - always in distant, far flung places; the outer Hebrides, or the Brecon Beacons. And they were\nalways\nthe night before the full moon. This was solid evidence, as far as Remus was concerned - Greyback was gathering followers, and no one else seemed to care; even the Aurors were being casual about it. Just like they had been with Lyall.\nBy early December, Remus was concerned enough to consult Ferox.\nThis year\u2019s Care of Magical Creatures syllabus had proved to be just as fascinating as the year before, and Ferox\u2019s dedication to teaching had not waned. He had even hinted at bringing in a real demiguise as a Christmas treat, though Remus had no idea where he was going to get one.\nThe teacher had taken them all down to the lake for one lesson, where Ferox had held a long, high pitched conversation with one of the merpeople who lived there. No one had the foggiest clue what they were talking about, but it had been interesting nonetheless, and Remus had made some very useful diagrams.\nIt was armed with these diagrams, and the accompanying essay, that Remus approached Ferox\u2019s office one gloomy afternoon in December. Since both Sirius and James were now on the quidditch team, it was much easier for Remus to sneak away and conduct his own personal business - lately either werewolf hunting or as Hogwart\u2019s premiere tobacco supplier. Lily had asked if he wanted to go to the library with her - he thought she must be feeling a bit lonely this term, as she was often asking if he wanted to go here or there with her. He hadn\u2019t noticed that she was spending any less time with Mary and Marlene, but who knew with girls?\nAnyway, having extricated himself from all other responsibilities, Remus knocked purposefully on the door to Ferox\u2019s office.\n\u201cCome in,\u201d the familiar liverpudlian sing-song voice called out. Remus smiled and stepped inside.\n\u201cHi, professor,\u201d he said, clutching his papers.\n\u201cLupin! Sit down, sit down,\u201d Ferox beamed up at him from behind his desk. He appeared to be making repairs to a very large golden cage; his desktop covered with tools and wire and other oddments which didn\u2019t seem to belong in a teacher\u2019s office.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got my merfolk essay here,\u201d he put it down on the only free bit of surface space.\n\u201cBlimey, Remus, you\u2019re keen!\u201d Professor Ferox smiled, tidying away his tools into a leather pouch. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t due until the last day of term.\u201d\nRemus shrugged, secretly thrilled,\n\u201cI had it finished, so I thought I might as well hand it in now.\u201d\n\u201cVery good. Fancy a tea?\u201d\n\u201cYes, please.\u201d\nFerox pushed the large cage to one side and waved his wand, casually. Ferox\u2019s wand was shorter than Remus\u2019s, and thicker, made of some knobbly type of wood, as if snapped directly from a tree branch. A teapot appeared from nowhere, closely followed two cups and saucers which clattered noisily onto to the table. They were quite old and chipped in places.\n\u201cOops,\u201d Ferox grinned, bashfully, \u201cNever had much finesse with charms. That\u2019s my Nan\u2019s old set, too.\u201d\nRemus smiled politely, and used his own wand to pour the tea. He found levitation very easy, and Ferox looked impressed. \u201cNan used to drink it from the saucer and everything,\u201d He murmured, nostalgically, lifting the cup to his lips, \u201cThought it was elegant, bless \u2018er.\u201d\nRemus never knew what to say when people started talking about their relatives. It had taken him four years to learn that people who had families did not really want to hear about the experiences of people without them. It made them uncomfortable. Ferox seemed to notice Remus\u2019s polite reticence and changed tact, \u201cAt this point my Nan would offer a biscuit and a cigarette, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve run out of both.\u201d\nRemus raised and eyebrow and fished inside his pocket,\n\u201cHere, sir,\u201d he said, offering a box of marlboro\u2019s.\n\u201cAh, so the rumours are true, eh? Our resident bootlegger.\u201d\nRemus shrugged again, carefully trying to mask his excitement as Ferox actually accepted a cigarette and lit it neatly with his wand point.\n\u201cHow\u2019d you do that?!\u201d He asked, trying it with his own wand, to no avail. Ferox chuckled,\n\u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d and Remus leaned across the desk to allow Ferox to light his cigarette. \u201cI better not teach you,\u201d the teacher winked, \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible habit.\u201d\nRemus grinned through the cloud of smoke, taking a long drag.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Ferox said, leaning back in his chair, \u201cI take it this is more than just a social visit, young Lupin?\u201d\n\u201cErm\u2026 yes, sort of,\u201d Remus nodded, clearing his throat, \u201cI just had a few more questions about\u2026 well I didn\u2019t know who to ask, and you said last year I could always come to you.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. Is this about your father?\u201d\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Remus shook his head vehemently, \u201cNot him.\u201d\nHe may have sounded a bit more forceful than he meant to - but he was\nsick\nof Lyall Lupin, and the awful, hollow, guilty feeling he got when he thought about the man. He didn\u2019t want to know any more about the past - this was about the future.\nRemus took another puff, letting it steady his nerves. \u201cIt\u2019s about Greyback.\u201d\n\u201cRemus\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI deserve to know.\u201d He said, darkly, losing his smile. \u201cIt\u2019s my life.\u201d\nFerox looked at him for a long time, before sighing.\n\u201cJust like your dad. Ok, what do you want to know? Not that there\u2019s much I can tell you, mind. Far as anyone knows, he\u2019s still a wanted fugitive.\u201d\n\u201cThe articles you gave me, one of them said that the ministry thought he was trying to raise an army, that\u2019s why he likes\u2026 children.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just a rumour.\u201d Ferox said, brows knit together, \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence.\u201d\n\u201c\nI\u2019m\nevidence.\u201d Remus said, unconsciously pressing a hand to his side, where the worst scar of all was hidden under his uniform.\n\u201cIt still doesn\u2019t mean\u2026 well, if he\u2019d been trying to do that in the sixties then you\u2019d think we\u2019d know about it by now, eh?\u201d\nThat was a spurious line of reasoning, in Remus\u2019s opinion, he waved a hand,\n\u201cThere\u2019ve been attacks, if you read the papers properly. The Dark Lord, he\u2019s the perfect person to encourage Greyback, from what I\u2019ve heard. Something needs to be done to stop people joining them. To stop\u2026 people like me from joining him.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you know about the so-called \u2018Dark Lord\u2019,\u201d Ferox replied, stiffly, \u201cBut he\u2019s only interested in blood purity. He would consider someone like Greyback a half-breed. Beneath him.\u201d\nRemus thought of Snape, and the other Slytherins, and immediately dismissed this theory too.\n\u201cHe might not respect him, but as long as Greyback gets the job done - and if he gets enough followers--\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re overestimating his power - both of them. The Dark Lord is just a political upstart, feeding off some perceived oppression; no one takes him seriously. No one who\nmatters\n. And Greyback - well, he\u2019s practically a derelict, a raving lunatic. Neither of them have anything substantial to offer their followers.\u201d\nRemus snorted,\n\u201cYeah, well the ministry doesn\u2019t exactly have much to offer\nme,\nexcept for a collar and a barred cell.\u201d\n\u201cRemus, that\u2019s not true,\u201d Ferox sounded distressed. Remus didn\u2019t care.\n\u201cYes it is! I\u2019m nearly fifteen, I\u2019m not a little boy. My job prospects are only\nslightly\nless shit as a muggle than they are as a wizard. Can\u2019t help but notice I\u2019m the\nonly one\nat Hogwarts, can\u2019t help but notice I\u2019m not s\u2019posed to tell anyone - oh wait, until I\u2019m seventeen, then I have to tell EVERYONE, right? Then everyone else knows to avoid me in case I get a bit peckish. Greyback might not have much to offer us halfbreeds, but when you haven\u2019t got a lot else going for you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cRemus, you\u2019ve got--\u201d\n\u201cNo! I\u2019ve READ the laws, and the statutes, and the bullshit fucking registry!\u201d\nHe stubbed out his cigarette in the dregs of his teacup, furiously. The full moon was weeks away, but his temperature was rising, his heart pounding as he glared at Ferox, challenging him to answer. Ferox himself looked quite shaken, struck dumb. This in itself cooled Remus\u2019s temper - he had meant to have a rational discussion, he had wanted to learn things; not yell at his favourite teacher. He pulled out another cigarette and lit it with the matchbook he carried, then pushed the box across the desk to Ferox.\n\u201cKeep it.\u201d He said, quietly, inhaling, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to shout.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok to shout, Remus,\u201d Ferox smiled, weakly, \u201cEspecially when someone isn\u2019t listening, and you need to be heard.\u201d\nRemus looked at him, quizzically. Ferox relaxed a bit, \u201cI think you see anger as a weakness, but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s good to be angry - and you\u2019ve got bloody good reason to be. You\u2019re right. We\nall\nneed to worry about Voldemort, and Greyback, and the rest of the pureblood crowd. If the ministry is prepared to treat good, clever, thoughtful wizards the way they treat you, then people like the Dark Lord will always have followers.\u201d\nRemus started at him, stunned.\n\u201cBut.\u201d Ferox said, \u201cThere will always be people working against them, too. And as long as we stay angry, they won\u2019t win.\u201d\n\u201cThey won\u2019t win.\u201d Remus repeated. He usually felt embarrassed after an outburst like that, but now he actually felt calmer - relieved, even.\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t you think for a minute that you have shit prospects.\u201d Ferox raised an eyebrow, \u201cIf you think Dumbledore moved heaven and earth to get you an education just to see you end up no better than a squib, then you don\u2019t know Dumbledore, my boy.\u201d\n* * *\nFriday 20th December 1974\nAs December drew on and the nights grew longer, the castle became engulfed in fairy lights and a heavy blanket of snow. Everyone seemed in higher spirits than usual, and more excited to celebrate Christmas than ever before. Owls swooped through the halls at lightning speed, delivering packages and brightly enveloped cards; the Herbology teacher had enchanted holly and ivy to weave itself around every chandelier and bannister; Professor Flitwick could be seen most evenings teaching the portraits to sing carols, and Sirius Black ended the term dressed head to toe in tinsel.\nThis hadn\u2019t actually been Sirius\u2019s idea - James had started it, using an everlasting sticking charm to affix the decorations to the collars and cuffs of Sirius\u2019s robes while he was asleep. If he\u2019d thought this might embarrass Sirius, he was sorely mistaken - Black adored his new look, and wore it with pride. In fact, by the last day of term, at least fifteen other boys had copied him, as well as a group of girls who had lately taken to following Sirius around.\nIt seemed that every girl in the school had now found out about the Great Snogging Race - and the effect was not what Remus had hoped for. While Marlene had acted sensibly in rejecting Black\u2019s advances, there were plenty of girls in their year - and even in the year above - who were hoping to help Sirius win the bet. He\u2019d thought this great fun at first, but after almost a month of being followed by a pack of giggling teenagers, receiving heavily scented love notes and being interrupted at almost every turn, he had enlisted Mary as a bodyguard.\nMary was perfect for this - bolshy, ready to speak her mind, and not interested in Sirius at all.\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a wuss,\u201d she sighed, on the last evening of term, as they all sat around the fireplace together. James was playing with a golden snitch he\u2019d nicked from the games shed, trying to impress Lily, who had her head down and was frantically finishing her Christmas cards.\nPeter was nowhere to be found, Marlene was playing a game of chess with Remus, and Sirius had just called Mary to sit closer to him, cautiously eyeing up a group of girls watching him from the corner.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a wuss,\u201d he replied, dryly, loosening his tie, \u201cI just like my privacy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could always just snog one of them,\u201d Mary shot back, stretching out on the couch and draping her legs over Sirius\u2019s lap. He let her. \u201cWasn\u2019t that the whole point of the bet?\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah,\u201d Sirius replied, in a measured tone, \u201cBut they weren\u2019t supposed to know about it, I was supposed to win them over with my charm and roguish good looks.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not\nscared\n, are you?\u201d Mary purred.\n\u201cI\u2019d be mad\nnot\nto be scared of girls.\u201d Sirius laughed, \u201cYou\u2019re all mental.\u201d\n\u201cMary, what\u2019s Darren\u2019s surname?\u201d Lily asked, looking up from her stack of cards.\n\u201cHarvey.\u201d Mary said, \u201cGawd, you\u2019re not sending him a card, are you? You\u2019ve only met him once!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to get cards at Christmas.\u201d Lily smiled, returning to her writing.\n\u201cAll right, but don\u2019t send it by owl, he\u2019s a muggle.\u201d\n\u201cHow have you been writing to him all year?\u201d Remus asked, genuinely interested.\n\u201cI send the letters to mum, and she pops them through his letter box. He only lives across the hall. And there\u2019s a phone box just outside Hogsmeade, so we\u2019ve chatted once or twice.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know there was a phone box!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a bit ancient - one of the Ravenclaws told me it was a portkey once during the war, but it still works.\u201d She stretched again, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see him,\u201d she sighed. Sirius pushed her legs away, pretending to lean over and watch the chess game.\n\u201cWhere are you for Christmas, Remus?\u201d Lily asked, licking her final envelope. \u201cNot staying here, I hope?\u201d\n\u201cLupin and Black are at mine again,\u201d James said, eagerly. Lily gave him a withering look.\n\u201cOh, of course.\u201d\nRemus was really looking forward to the Potters this year. He\u2019d only be staying a week, as the full moon fell on the twenty ninth, but that was fine by him - he just couldn\u2019t wait for the presents and the decorations, and Mrs Potter\u2019s cooking.\n\u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d Sirius yawned, lazily, \u201cWhere\u2019s Pete? Can we send him to the kitchens for us?\u201d\n\u201cNo idea where he is actually.\u201d James said, \u201cHaven\u2019t seen him since dinner.\u201d\n\u201cIs he packing?\u201d Lily suggested.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go and check,\u201d Remus stood up, stretching. \u201cI\u2019m hungry too, I think there are some cauldron cakes in my trunk\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say\u2026\u201d Sirius got up too, following him. Remus sighed. Sirius spent half his time begging for sweets off the rest of them. Not that he wasn\u2019t generous with his own - he just very rarely seemed to have any.\nPeter was not in the dorm room, but the cauldron cakes were.\n\u201cWonder what\u2019s happened to him.\u201d Remus rubbed the back of his head.\n\u201cCheck the map,\u201d Sirius said, spraying crumbs everywhere, mouth full of cake. Remus raised an eyebrow but said nothing, and retrieved the map from his bedside table.\nHe cast the locator spell, and the map quickly highlighted a small flag with the name \u2018Peter Pettigrew\u2019. It looked as though he was in a broom cupboard near the Charms classroom.\n\u201c\nWossee doon therr\n?\u201d Sirius mumbled, stuffing another cake in his mouth. Remus tutted this time, folding up the map.\n\u201cI dunno. You don\u2019t reckon the Slytherins got him?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe?\u201d Sirius swallowed, \u201cIf they put a binding spell on him he might be stuck there all night. Let\u2019s go and get him, then.\u201d\n\u201cShall I get James?\u201d\n\u201cErr\u2026\u201d Sirius glanced at the door, and Remus knew at once that he was dreading having to pass the gauntlet of girls waiting down there. \u201cNah, let's take the cloak and sneak down - it won\u2019t take long, and only two of us fit anyway.\u201d\nRemus shrugged by way of consent. If it didn\u2019t take too long to rescue Peter then maybe they could go to the kitchens afterwards. Sirius had finished his cauldron cakes. They huddled under the cloak together and hurried quietly downstairs, past James and the girls, out through the portrait hole.\n\u201cBloody typical of Peter,\u201d Sirius huffed, under his breath, \u201cFour years as a marauder and still crap at defensive spells.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe they attacked from behind,\u201d Remus suggested, \u201cOr maybe there were a lot of them.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t know why, but he loved contradicting Sirius. James called it bickering, but Sirius had never given any sign that it bothered him. On they went, through the shadowy stone hallways, towards the Charms corridor.\n\u201cHere, is it that one?\u201d Sirius whispered, as they reached a door.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus replied, \u201cHe\u2019s in there.\u201d He could smell him.\n\u201cOk, wand ready?\u2026 One, two, THREE!\u201d\nSirius yanked open the door quickly, much to the surprise of Peter - who was very much not in danger - and Desdemona Lewis, who shrieked,\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?!\u201d She stared around, pale and wide eyed, her hair mussed up and her lips very pink and wet. Pete stared about as well, slightly more suspiciously, but just as rumpled,\n\u201cProbably just Peeves.\u201d\nSirius began to shudder with laughter, and Remus quickly clamped a hand over his mouth, trying to pull him away from the cupboard. Poor Peter.\n\u201cI\u2019m going back to my common room, I\u2019ll get in so much trouble if I\u2019m caught out of bounds again,\u201d Desdemona was saying, straightening her blouse. She kissed Peter dainty on the nose, \u201cSee you tomorrow, Petey? On the train?\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026 ok\u2026\u201d Peter replied, very distracted, still staring about, looking for their invisible assailant. Remus thanked whatever god there was for his superior strength, as Sirius fought madly to get free and cause even more mischief.\nRemus did not let him go until Desdemona had disappeared around the corner. Peter was wise to the situation by then anyway.\n\u201cAll right, show yourselves!\u201d He pulled out his wand just as Remus released Sirius and they both burst out from under the invisibility cloak.\n\u201cI KNEW IT!\u201d Peter yelled,\n\u201cYOU SNEAK!\u201d Sirius crowed, laughing so hard he was holding his stomach, \u201cHow long had that been going on?!\u201d\n\u201cA week,\u201d Peter replied, turning red, \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d\n\u201cA WEEK?! Merlin, Pettigrew! What do you think you\u2019re about, lying to us for a whole week?!\u201d\n\u201cYou would have teased me!\u201d\n\u201cWe tease you anyway.\u201d\n\u201cCan we please go to the kitchens now?\u201d Remus sighed.\n\u201cWait \u2018til James hears about this!\u201d Sirius said, sounding awestruck, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. I really can\u2019t. Peter Pettigrew: Ladies Man.\u201d\n\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d Peter sulked, shoving his hands in his pockets. \u201cI\u2019m going to the common room, I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\n\u201cWell, the way you were eating Lewis\u2019s face off\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Peter disappeared around the next corridor.\nSirius laughed all the way to the kitchens, and was still slightly hysterical on the way back, even laden with treats and goodies from the house elves.\n\u201cAt least this means that stupid snogging race is over.\u201d Remus said, pleasantly, as they approached the portrait of the fat lady. Sirius stopped dead in his tracks, causing Remus to bump into him, nearly dropping his bottle of butterbeer.\n\u201cUgh, I didn\u2019t think of that!\u201d\n\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to think about it now,\u201d Remus snapped, rubbing his elbow where he\u2019d banged it, \u201cPete won.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right Moony. Ugggh! That means that if I don\u2019t get a snog by the end of this year then I\u2019m more of a loser than\nPettigrew\n!\u201d\nRemus sighed, heavily."

            "summary_and_notes": "",
            "content": "Monday 23rd December 1974\n\n\nThough Hogwarts had been as picturesque as a Christmas card under its blanket of highland snow, the marauders stepped off the train in London to grey, southern drizzle. The weather continued in much the same way for most of the Christmas break, meaning that sledging was off the cards this year, much to Remus\u2019s disappointment.\n\n\nIt meant that the first few days before Christmas were pretty boring, and they made up for it by making regular trips into the village, underneath Mr Potter\u2019s huge black umbrella, and spent long afternoons in the muggle cinema there.\n\n\nRemus had convinced them to go - he hadn\u2019t been to see a film since he\u2019d started at Hogwarts, and Ste\u2019s gang had been talking about\n\n\nDeath Wish\n\n\nall summer, so he was dying to see it. It was just as exciting as he\u2019d hoped; full of revenge and gore - and Charles Bronson reminded him a bit of Professor Ferox. James and Sirius were more interested in figuring out how the projector worked - which suited Remus fine, because it meant they agreed to go with him twice.\n\n\nHowever, boredom soon got the better of them, and on the third visit to the picturehouse, a distraction presented itself in the form of a group of girls queuing at the ticket booth. At once, James and Sirius stopped discussing the ins and outs of visual perception versus frame rate, and started acting very oddly indeed. James made more of an effort to flatten his hair than ever, while Sirius began leaning casually against the wall as if he was James Dean.\n\n\nThe girls obviously noticed, and kept glancing back and then giggling amongst themselves. They must be freezing, wearing miniskirts in December, Remus thought to himself. Finally, the girls finished buying their tickets and went into the second screen.\n\n\n\u201cMoony,\u201d Sirius said, not taking his eyes off the gaggle of long legs that had just passed, \u201cHow about we see something different today?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d James nodded, blankly.\n\n\nRemus looked up at the poster above the door.\n\n\nThe Great Gatsby\n\n\n. He screwed up his face,\n\n\n\u201cUgh, it\u2019s a\n\n\nromance\n\n\n, though, what do you want to see that for?\u201d He protested. But it was too late, they were already halfway in.\n\n\nRemus settled down in the front row and resigned himself to his fate. It might not be that bad - he\u2019d liked Robert Redford in\n\n\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\n\n\n- he wasn\u2019t as cool as Charles Bronson, but he might shoot someone, at the very least.\n\n\nHalf an hour later and - as much as he didn\u2019t want to admit it - Remus was thoroughly immersed in the film, for all its pastel shades and silly costumes. There had been no shooting so far, but he was hoping for the best, and in the meantime, was rooting for Daisy to see sense and leave her awful husband.\n\n\nAt some point, Remus glanced to his left, to see if Sirius and James were enjoying the film too - and found that he had been abandoned. Twisting about in his seat, he stared into the darkness behind him, and could just about make out the dark shapes of his two friends sitting in the very back row - both engaged in some kind of horrendous teenage grappling match with two of the girls from earlier.\n\n\nMortified, Remus turned around at once, slouching down low in the red velvet seat. He couldn\u2019t concentrate on the film now - and he\u2019d been right, anyway; it was a stupid, boring,\n\n\ngirly\n\n\nromance, and Robert Redford clearly wasn\u2019t going to shoot anyone any time soon. In a split second he made his decision and quickly left the theatre.\n\n\nIt was too late to get a ticket for\n\n\nDeath Wish\n\n\n, and the usher behind the ticket stand was giving him a very pointed look, so he shoved his hands deep in his pockets and sloped out, feeling bitter and mean. The town James\u2019s parents lived in was a lot posher than the one Remus had grown up in - it was all pretty red brick cottages and oak trees. There was a big village green at the centre, and Remus could imagine cricket taking place there in the summer. It was raining now, though, and James had the umbrella, so Remus had no choice but to duck for cover under the nearest bus shelter.\n\n\nThere was a little shop, right opposite the bus stop, and he watched it for a while, checking out the simplest entry points. Not that he was going to break in. He definitely\n\n\ncould\n\n\n; it looked really easy - but what if Mr and Mrs Potter found out? They\u2019d never have him for Christmas again. He thought about going back to the house, but he didn\u2019t want to explain why he\u2019d left Sirius and James in the picturehouse like that. Pricks. He kicked the side of the shelter with his heavy boots. An old woman, walking past with her little scottie dog tutted at him loudly, and he swore in return, throwing up a middle finger.\n\n\nEven\n\n\nJames\n\n\nhad let him down now. James! Whose pure and honest adoration for Lily Evans had been the one thing which convinced Remus that snogging might not be that disgusting after all. He\u2019d expected something like this from Sirius, who had never had any kind of impulse control anyway, but\n\n\nJames\n\n\n?!\n\n\n\u201cOi, Moony!\u201d As if by magic, James and Sirius appeared on the other side of the road, underneath the big black umbrella. He tried to ignore them, but it was a bit stupid, seeing as they were the only three people on the street.\n\n\n\u201cWhere are you off to?\u201d Sirius grinned, as they crossed to join him under the bus shelter.\n\n\n\u201cJust sitting here.\u201d Remus shrugged.\n\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you leave?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCould ask you the same!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe only popped off for a minute\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUgh, I don\u2019t want to hear about it.\u201d Remus covered his ears. He glared at James, \u201cWhat about Lily? What about \u2018it\u2019s not time yet, but I don\u2019t mind\u2019?\u201d Remus parroted back the words James had spoken in November.\n\n\nJames looked stricken for a moment, but Sirius laughed heartily and slapped Remus on the shoulder,\n\n\n\u201cOh come off it. Evans isn\u2019t going to care if Potter snogged some muggle girl when he was fourteen. Calm down, Moony.\u201d\n\n\nThat did it. If there was anything more likely to send Remus into a rage, it was being told to \u2018calm down\u2019.\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d He growled, \u201cYou made me watch that stupid girls film just so you could grope a couple of muggle birds in the back row!\u201d\n\n\nSirius tossed his dark hair and rolled his eyes,\n\n\n\u201cMerlin, Lupin - we can go and see your beloved Charles Bronson\n\n\ntomorrow\n\n\n, if you really want. I mean,\n\n\nexcuse us\n\n\nif we want to act like\n\n\nnormal\n\n\nteenagers for five minutes.\u201d\n\n\nSomething about this insult struck Remus so sharply, that if he\u2019d had his wand he\u2019d have cursed Sirius right then and there. As it was, he only had his fists - fortunately he was pretty good with those, and punching was often a lot more satisfying than cursing. By the time James had wrenched them apart and stood between them, Sirius\u2019s nose was extremely bloody, and Remus could feel the beginnings of a black eye forming.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\n\n\nwrong\n\n\nwith you two?!\u201d James huffed, dragging them both through the rain back to his parents house.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a tosser!\u201d Remus spat, trying to keep the drizzle out of his sore eye.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a wanker!\u201d Sirius returned, stuffily, holding his wet jumper up against his nose.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re both dickheads,\u201d James said, firmly, as they reached the front gate.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nMrs Potter fixed them both up very quickly - she was just as quick at healing spells as Madam Pomfrey - then gave them a good telling off, with Mr Potter standing behind her, trying not to smile and saying \u201cboys will be boys, Effie dear\u2026\u201d\n\n\nAfterwards, Remus went straight up to the spare room and sat on the bed for the rest of the day doing his holiday homework. He knew it was silly and childish to sulk, but if he had to see Sirius again he couldn\u2019t be sure he wouldn't swing for him. He thought about Ferox telling him \u2018It\u2019s good to be angry\u2019 - but somehow didn\u2019t think that was what the teacher meant.\n\n\nWas he jealous? Jealous that all his friends had copped off with a girl now, and he hadn\u2019t? Maybe that was it. Remus couldn\u2019t really ignore the fact that he was the only one of his friends who wasn\u2019t completely driven by his hormones -\n\n\nlike a normal teenager\n\n\n, as Sirius had so kindly put it. Ouch; there was that pain again. Remus drew his knees up under his chin, making himself as small as possible. If he had a galleon for every way in which he was\n\n\nnot normal\n\n\n.\n\n\nHe went down for dinner, but didn\u2019t talk to James or Sirius, limiting himself only to polite interchanges with Mr and Mrs Potter. After they were excused from the table, he went straight back upstairs and curled up under the duvet with a book until he fell asleep.\n\n\nHe dreamed that he was back in the cinema, trying to watch a strange combination of\n\n\nThe Great Gatsby\n\n\nand\n\n\nDeath Wish\n\n\n- in which Professor Ferox really was Charles Bronson, black moustache and all, aiming his pistol at the gleaming socialites of West Egg. Something kept nudging Remus\u2019s elbow, distracting him from the film - he turned and saw that it was Peter and Desdemona, writhing about in the seat beside him, lips locked.\n\n\nAnnoyed, Remus got up and sat in the row behind, returning to the film. Soon, something else bothered him - it was Mary and Darren. Remus had of course never met Darren, and the boy in the dream looked just like Muciber, for some reason. They were snogging too. Disgusted, Remus tried to get up once more, but tripped over Lily and James, who were rolling in the aisle.\n\n\n\u201cFor god\u2019s sake!\u201d He shouted. Lily looked up at him and laughed - so did Mary, and now Peter and James too.\n\n\nSirius appeared at the very back of the theatre, his body silhouetted by the whirring projector,\n\n\n\u201cNever mind him,\u201d he laughed along with the others, \u201cHe\u2019s not like us.\u201d\n\n\nRemus spun around just in time to see Ferox shoot Robert Redford, then woke up with a start.\n\n\nHe was hot and sweating under the heavy duvet, and had to fight to free himself. Feeling very silly for having had a nightmare at his age, he clambered out of the large four poster bed and headed for the nearest bathroom. The clock on the landing read midnight, so he didn\u2019t turn any lights on, though he could see a faint yellowish glow seeping out from under James\u2019s bedroom door.\n\n\nRemus used the loo, then washed his hands and face, taking a few sips from the cold tap before wiping himself dry on his pyjama sleeves. Feeling much better, he returned to his bedroom, just as James\u2019s door swung open.\n\n\n\u201cBloody hell, it\u2019s you, Moony!\u201d James whispered, sounding relieved, \u201cWhat you doing creeping round in the dark?!\u201d\n\n\nRemus shrugged and whispered back,\n\n\n\u201cI can see in the dark. Didn\u2019t want to wake anyone up.\u201d\n\n\nJames nodded, and opened his door a bit wider,\n\n\n\u201cThought you might be Gully, spying on us for mum or something. Come in, eh? Let\u2019s all be mates again.\u201d\n\n\nIt didn\u2019t take much convincing for Remus to agree. Fighting took up too much energy, especially when you all lived together. He still didn\u2019t really want to talk to Sirius, but he went in for James\u2019s sake.\n\n\nSirius was sitting cross legged on James\u2019s bed, and frowned when he saw Remus. James sighed,\n\n\n\u201cCome on, we\u2019re all friends, right? It\u2019s Christmas.\u201d\n\n\nSirius nodded, solemnly. Remus nodded back. He joined them on the bed, where he was surprised to see they were pouring over some spellbooks.\n\n\n\u201cHomework?\u201d He asked.\n\n\n\u201cPrank.\u201d James replied. \u201cHaven\u2019t worked out the kinks yet, though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, ok.\u201d Remus nodded. And then, because he didn\u2019t want it to be awkward any more, he asked; \u201cHow\u2019s your nose, Black?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Sirius grinned at him, relaxing into humour at once, \u201cYou\u2019re losing your touch.\u201d\n\n\nRemus smirked,\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah? Ask Snape. Headbutted him on the train in September.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou never did!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYup.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBloody hell,\u201d James laughed, \u201cAnd he hasn\u2019t tried it on since?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d Remus said, trying not to sound too nervous about it, \u201cProbably planning something, though. What\u2019s the prank?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll um\u2026 tell you when we know how to do it. Might not come off right.\u201d James said, quickly, closing the book nearest him. Remus raised an eyebrow and said nothing - this only confirmed a suspicion he\u2019d had for quite some time. He didn\u2019t want to get into any of that now, though, he\u2019d wait and see if anything came of it.\n\n\n\u201cSorry I brought up Lily.\u201d He told James, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it, Sirius is right, she won\u2019t care - if she\u2019s ever stupid enough to go out with you, that is.\u201d\n\n\nJames shoved him playfully,\n\n\n\u201cPiss off.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAt least that stupid competition is over now, yeah?\u201d Remus asked, hopefully, looking at Sirius.\n\n\n\u201cYeah I s\u2019pose,\u201d Sirius shrugged, \u201cWe paid Pete his dues, anyway. What a letdown, though - snogging, I mean. Dunno what all the fuss is about.\u201d\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t say anything, though he was secretly pleased. So he\n\n\nwasn\u2019t\n\n\nmissing out on anything after all.\n\n\n\u201cIt was alright,\u201d James said, diplomatically. \u201cProbably takes practice. Must get better.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt had better.\u201d Sirius said, very seriously.\n\n\nJames and Remus burst out laughing.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nChristmas Day 1974\n\n\nChristmas morning was as dark and gloomy as the previous week had been, and Remus was woken by the noise of the rain pelting against his bedroom window. Still, the Potter's house was as festive as ever, and the five of them settled down to a hearty breakfast with smiles on their faces.\n\n\nBreakfast was quickly followed by presents - the usual fair of sweets, chocolate, new quills from the Potters, books and socks. Remus was very surprised to receive a hand-knitted scarf from Lily, in Gryffindor red with gold tassels. He felt a bit bad - he hadn\u2019t bought anything for any of the marauders this year, let alone any of the girls. She\u2019d never given him a gift before, except for the reading aid - which, he had to admit, had been a pretty good present. He resolved to get something for her next time they went to Hogsmeade.\n\n\nThey were just finishing up with the presents, Mrs Potter vanishing the scrunched up wrapping paper with a sweep of her wand - when a loud, mournful song sounded in the hallway. It was a high pitched, haunting melody - completely unnatural and completely beautiful. They all turned at once, Mr and Mrs Potter withdrawing their wands in a duelling stance, and a strange, ethereal silver bird flew into the room, circling their heads. Remus recognised it at once as a phoenix - or something like the ghost of one.\n\n\n\u201cDumbledore,\u201d Mr Potter said, quietly, as the silver phoenix settled magisterially on the mantelpiece. Much to Remus\u2019s surprise, the bird opened its beak and spoke in their headmaster\u2019s voice.\n\n\n\u201cThere has been an attack. I will be with you shortly - do not allow anyone else entry.\u201d\n\n\nAnd with that, the phoenix vanished into thin air. They were all quiet for a while, before Mrs Potter spoke, placing a hand on James\u2019s shoulder, as if she just needed to touch her son.\n\n\n\u201cOh Monty, an attack!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo need to panic,\u201d Mr Potter said calmly, \u201cAlbus will be here soon. Boys, finish cleaning up here, eh? I\u2019ll be in my study.\u201d\n\n\nThey tidied up in silence, all waiting to see what would happen next. An attack - what could that mean? Remus\u2019s mind went straight to Greyback - but it wasn\u2019t a full moon, so unlikely to have been werewolves. Could it be Voldemort? Or were there other dark wizards out there? Guiltily, he looked over at Sirius, who was staring out of the window at the rain, looking pale and shocked.\n\n\nHis\n\n\nfamily were dark wizards. Did he know anything about it? Surely not, Remus quickly dismissed the idea, feeling even worse; Sirius hadn\u2019t been home since the summer, and it was common knowledge that his family hated him.\n\n\nFinally, after what felt like a decade, but can only have been twenty minutes, there was a *CRACK* of apparition outside, and Mr Potter was at the front door. Mrs Potter joined him, and James, Sirius and Remus hung back in the hallway, watching.\n\n\nThe door opened and Dumbledore stood there looking very grave, completely dry despite the rain beating down in sheets.\n\n\n\u201cFleamont, Euphemia,\u201d he nodded politely.\n\n\nMr Potter held up his wand,\n\n\n\u201cWhat was the last thing we spoke about?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYour son having broken his record for number of detentions this term.\u201d Dumbledore smiled, glancing at James, who turned red. This apparently satisfied Mr Potter, who stepped back to allow Dumbledore entry.\n\n\n\u201cCome in, Dumbledore, would you like some tea?\u201d Mrs Potter asked, taking his travelling cloak and ushering him into the living room.\n\n\n\u201cUpstairs, boys.\u201d Mr Potter said, sternly. James looked about to argue, but Dumbledore stepped in for him.\n\n\n\u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind, Fleamont, I think it best that the boys hear this. It will be all over the papers tomorrow anyway.\u201d\n\n\nMr Potter looked at his wife, then nodded. The small party sat down in the large living room, waiting for Gully to come in with the tea. It was a very odd scene; Christmas cards still glittering on the walls, tinsel sparkling along the picture rails, opened presents piled up under the tree - and Dumbledore, still looking uncharacteristically serious in midnight blue velvet robes. Sirius, James and Remus sat squashed up on one sofa, while Mr Potter remained standing, pacing the room.\n\n\n\u201cAn attack, then?\u201d He finally said, impatient.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. The Fraser family, in Newcastle.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFraser? Never heard of them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo. Mr and Mrs Fraser were both muggleborn. They had two children not yet old enough for Hogwarts, but as far as we know, showing signs of magical ability.\u201d\n\n\nRemus winced at the past tense. Mr Potter had clearly noticed this too, for he looked very pale and tired all of a sudden.\n\n\n\u201cAll four of them?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\nMrs Potter looked like she was about to cry,\n\n\n\u201cChildren!\u201d She gasped. \u201cChildren!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd do we know for sure?\u201d Mr Potter continued, anxiously, \u201cWe know it was\u2026 him?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cVoldemort, yes. He left a mark.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA mark?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt will be in the papers tomorrow, I imagine. The Daily Prophet was there before I was alerted.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut what does it mean? Who were the Frasers?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMr Fraser worked for St Mungo\u2019s,\u201d Dumbledore explained, \u201cHe recently raised a petition with the ministry suggesting that healers receive training in muggle healing techniques - first aid, I believe he called it. This didn\u2019t go down very well with certain factions, I\u2019m sure you can imagine.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think I remember Darius saying something,\u201d Mr Potter nodded, leaning a hand on the mantelpiece thoughtfully, \u201cBut to kill!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been the first time,\u201d Dumbledore said, darkly, \u201cBut it is the first time they have made themselves known. This mark that was left behind - it has been seen elsewhere. Some of the old families have adopted it; a kind of secret sign of their allegiance to Voldemort. Only not so secret, any more.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhich families?\u201d Sirius said, suddenly, looking at Dumbledore. He was tense all over, Remus could feel it. Dumbledore looked at him kindly,\n\n\n\u201cThere is so far nothing to link the Blacks to this attack.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo far.\u201d Sirius repeated. \u201cBut you know they\u2026 they\u2019re\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help anybody to jump to conclusions,\u201d Dumbledore held up a hand, \u201cThe situation is grave, yes, but we must not lose our heads, or allow emotion to cloud our judgement. There are difficult times ahead, and we will all need each other to be vigilant.\u201d\n\n\nHe said this directly to Sirius, and seemed to be speaking to James and Remus too. Remus felt an uncomfortable twisting in his abdomen - he didn\u2019t understand everything, but he knew that some great responsibility had settled on their shoulders. One he wasn\u2019t sure he could live up to.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to frighten anyone,\u201d Dumbledore continued, as if he had read Remus\u2019s mind, \u201cBut nor do I wish to devalue the seriousness of today\u2019s events. I am working quickly to gather support, a line of defence against Voldemort. I have already spoken to a number of trustworthy associates within the ministry - Fleamont, can I count on you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Mr Potter said at once, \u201cHave you spoken to the Weasleys? The Prewetts? The Bones\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\nDumbledore nodded, smiling,\n\n\n\u201cAll on my list, of course.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe can help!\u201d James spoke up. Mrs Potter sucked in her breath, her eyes still very pink.\n\n\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Sirius said, eager to show himself equal to James. \u201cYou can depend on us, sir.\u201d\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t say anything, but he nodded along, hoping that Dumbledore knew that he too had chosen his side.\n\n\n\u201cI hope it won\u2019t come to that.\u201d Dumbledore was smiling, his forget-me-not blue eyes twinkling with emotion for his pupils. \u201cBut thank you, boys.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Mrs Potter said, \u201cThey\u2019re children, Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m of age in two years!\u201d Sirius said, straightening up, asserting his position as the eldest marauder. \u201cAnd we\u2019re the best in the year at defensive spells!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd hexes,\u201d James put in, then quickly shut up, seeing the look his mother shot him.\n\n\nDumbledore chuckled, softly.\n\n\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d He said, \u201cYour mother is quite right, however. All I ask is that you are on your guard, and that you look after each other. Now, I must be going, I have other calls to make. Fleamont,\u201d Dumbledore stood up and shook Mr Potter\u2019s hand, \u201cI will be in touch. Euphemia,\u201d he turned to Mrs Potter apologetically, \u201cMerry Christmas. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be attending your party, tonight.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe may as well cancel it,\u201d Mrs Potter rubbed her arms, as if the room had turned cold, \u201cIt seems disrespectful.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEnjoy your holiday, boys - Remus, Madam Pomfrey will meet you at the Three Broomsticks\u2019 floo stop on Sunday morning.\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded, obediently, and with that, Dumbledore vanished with a loud *CRACK*."

            "summary_and_notes": "",
            "content": "Wednesday 8th January 1975\n\n\nDumbledore was quite right - the Fraser family\u2019s murder was front page news on boxing day, followed by a series of features and articles on the mounting war, which dominated the rest of the Christmas break.\n\n\nIt was the first time Remus - or any of them - ever saw the dark mark, and they had no idea then that it was a symbol they would fear for the rest of their lives. A great black skull with a gaping mouth, and a long ropey serpent writhing forth. It was distinctly Slytherin-esque, and as soon as they were back at Hogwarts Sirius blasted the remaining snake motifs off of his trunk.\n\n\n\u201cCareful, mate,\u201d James said, as smoke from Sirius\u2019s spell filled the room, \u201cYou might be ruining a family heirloom there.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d Sirius replied, firing his wand at the blackened wood once more, for good measure, \u201cIt\u2019s mine, and I don\u2019t want anything of mine to have that ruddy mark on it.\u201d\n\n\nIt was pointless trying to reason with him. Since Dumbledore\u2019s visit to the Potters Sirius\u2019s hatred for anything remotely Slytherin had increased tenfold. He had been using hexes to defend younger students from Slytherins all year, but now he seemed to be actively seeking out trouble.\n\n\n\u201cThe war isn\u2019t happening\n\n\nhere\n\n\n.\u201d Remus tried telling him once, after his third detention in as many days, \u201cDumbledore told us to be vigilant, not start fights.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe war is everywhere.\u201d Sirius replied, and James nodded in agreement. \u201cAnyway,\n\n\nyou\n\n\ncan talk, what about you and Snape?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d Remus replied, piously, \u201cWas personal.\u201d\n\n\nIt was true; he didn\u2019t hate Snape because he was a dark wizard, or a Slytherin, or anything like that. Remus didn\u2019t like Snape because he was a nosey busybody - that, and nobody\n\n\nreally\n\n\nliked Snape, except Lily.\n\n\nActually, Remus thought to himself, as he looked across the common room at Lily, sitting by Marlene working on some sort of transfiguration spell on a pair of shoes, even Lily hadn\u2019t been hanging around Severus very much these days. Perhaps they\u2019d fallen out. The redhead looked up and met his eyes, smiling brightly. He smiled back. James, sitting next to him, waved, and Lily rolled her eyes and returned to the spell she was working on.\n\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t she know how much I\u2019ve matured?\u201d James sighed, heavily, thumbing the pages of his textbook roughly.\n\n\n\u201cI dunno if snogging a muggle in the back of the cinema really counts as maturing.\u201d Remus replied, rescuing the manhandled book and smoothing down the corners James had bent.\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean\n\n\nthat\n\n\n,\u201d James grinned, \u201cJust like\u2026 in general. I don\u2019t get it, I get on with Marlene ok.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re on the quidditch team with Marlene,\u201d Peter said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got stuff in common with her.\u201d\n\n\n(Peter had become very wise, since getting a girlfriend.)\n\n\n\u201cSo, what,\u201d James said, slowly, \u201cYou think I should try and get Lily on the quidditch team?\u201d\n\n\nPeter tutted, pitifully,\n\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you find out something you\n\n\nboth\n\n\nhave in common? Like how me and Desdemona both like chess, and cheese sandwiches, and--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got nothing in common,\u201d James replied, dreamily, \u201cThat\u2019s why I like her.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNever going to happen, then.\u201d Peter sniffed, with an air of finality. James looked crestfallen.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to him,\u201d Remus said, taking pity, \u201cPeople don\u2019t just go out with people because they\u2019re the same, that would be boring. Opposites attract, and all that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right, Moony!\u201d James cheered up. \u201cMaybe I\n\n\nshould\n\n\nfind out what sort of stuff she likes, though\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 yeah, might be a start.\u201d Remus shook his head, returning to his Charms essay. He\u2019d made his peace with the girl-obsession now; it was easier to just nod along and pretend to be sympathetic.\n\n\nFortunately, most of James and Sirius\u2019s attention was taken up with training for the upcoming quidditch match against Slytherin, which was set for early February. With the war looming over everyone, the competition between the two houses had taken on a new and important meaning, and Sirius and James treated their positions on the team as full time occupations.\n\n\nAs a consequence, Remus saw very little of them at the beginning of the spring term - he spent much of his time in the library, as usual, and when the other two weren\u2019t on the pitch practicing (with Peter watching, of course), they were in detention for one thing or another. There was hardly time to work on the map, or even plan a new prank; the marauders passed each other like ships in the night.\n\n\nThe situation grew so extreme that when the first Hogsmeade weekend rolled around halfway through January, Remus found himself without anyone to go with. He almost considered not going at all, until Lily brought it up after Potions one afternoon, suggesting that he go with her and (he assumed) Mary and Marlene. It sounded like a nice enough way to spend his saturday, and he remembered that he still owed Lily a present for Christmas.\n\n\nAs agreed, Remus met Lily in the common room on saturday morning, and they started down towards the Hogwarts front entrance.\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened to the M\u2019s?\u201d Remus asked, surprised when he found they were alone. Lily blushed, but that might have been the cold air,\n\n\n\u201cI thought it could just be the two of us, this time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d He smiled. He liked Lily\u2019s company very much \u2013 almost as much as the marauders.\n\n\n\u201cSo, what are they all in detention for?\u201d She asked, as they trudged through the snow down to the village.\n\n\n\u201cVarious things,\u201d Remus waved his hand, \u201cPeter got caught out of bounds after dark, James got the blame for changing the words on the Slytherin trophies\u2026 and I think Sirius hexed a second year.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTypical,\u201d Lily tutted.\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus grinned, as they trudged through the snow, following the trail of dark robed students ahead of them. \u201cThe trophy thing was brilliant though, you have to admit. The charm lasted seven days!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a very nice thing to do, though.\u201d Lily frowned. Remus sighed. Why did girls always want to be nice?!\n\n\nOnce they reached the village, they stopped at the stationers, because they both needed new quills. Remus bought one for Sirius and one for Peter too, because they\u2019d asked, telling Lily how Peter pressed too hard on his parchment and snapped two quills a week, leaving blotches everywhere \u2013 and how Sirius only used the most expensive brand, because he was vain about his handwriting.\n\n\nAfter that they went to the post office, where Remus sent the Potters a package on James\u2019s behalf \u2013 it was Mrs Potter\u2019s birthday, he explained to Lily; and James hated missing any occasion to give a gift. Freezing cold by then, they decided that a butterbeer had to be the next port of call, and opted for the Three Broomsticks.\n\n\nThey found a small table by the fireplace and sat companionably, chatting about their lessons and their Christmases. Lily had had a big fight with her sister, which she talked about at great length. Remus told her about going to see\n\n\nDeath Wish\n\n\n, but didn\u2019t mention Dumbledore\u2019s visit.\n\n\n\u201cDo you go to the Potter\u2019s every year, then?\u201d Lily asked.\n\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d Remus nodded, fervently, \u201cThey\u2019re amazing. Me and Sirius always go. And Pete\u2019s only up the road from James, so that\u2019s cool.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you four\n\n\nalways\n\n\ntogether?\u201d Lily looked amused. It rubbed Remus up the wrong way.\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re my friends. My best mates.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know that,\u201d she replied, sounding a bit snippy herself, \u201cBut you\u2019ve been talking about them all afternoon.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHave not.\u201d Remus grunted, defensively, looking into his butterbeer, embarrassed. \u201c...So what If I have?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell I sort of wanted to get to know\n\n\nyou\n\n\na bit better, not your friends.\u201d Lily had two red patches in her cheeks now, like a Dutch doll. Remus couldn\u2019t understand why she was so annoyed.\n\n\n\u201cYou\n\n\nknow\n\n\nme, though. You\u2019ve known me for four years!\u201d\n\n\nLily stared at him, disbelieving. Then her expression changed. She ran a hand through her hair and laughed, humourlessly.\n\n\n\u201cOh,\n\n\nRemus\n\n\n.\u201d She sighed.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\nShe shook her head,\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m such an idiot. You really have no idea why I wanted to spend the weekend with you, do you?\u201d\n\n\nHe shrugged. She smiled, giving him that pitying look that girls were so good at. \u201cNever mind,\u201d she said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\n\nAfter that, the tone of the afternoon seemed to change. Lily appeared to relax into her usual self and started joking along with him. She even had a bit of a whinge about Snape, who\u2019d said something extremely rude to Mary recently. Remus never got to the bottom of why she\u2019d been so moody in the first place, but he decided that it might have just been his mentioning his friends - she\u2019d always been clear about finding them annoying. She would only accept the price of a butterbeer from him by way of a present, and assured him that he needn\u2019t feel like he owed her anything.\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the next day, when Remus, James, Sirius and Peter were sitting at breakfast, that everything became clear. James and Sirius were in their quidditch robes ready for practice, furtively discussing tactics, while Peter listened in with deep interest, nodding and murmuring, \u201cYeah, exactly,\u201d now and then. Remus was checking his book list - he had several to return and a few more he still needed to cross-reference before he could complete his Transfiguration essay.\n\n\nMarlene settled down next to them, in her own red robes, and reached for the tea.\n\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d she addressed Remus, \u201cHow did yesterday go?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d he asked, looking up from his parchment, \u201cYesterday?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou and Lily, in Hogsmeade!\u201d She was giving him a very knowing smile. \u201cShe won\u2019t tell us what happened, so it must be good.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius looked up, curiously, \u201cWhat\n\n\nare\n\n\nyou talking about, McKinnon?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t he tell you?\u201d She stirred sugar into her tea, innocently, \u201cRemus and Lily went on a date yesterday.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d James, Sirius and Remus all exclaimed at the same time. Sirius began to laugh,\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nMoony\n\n\non a date?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWith Evans?!\u201d James looked horrified.\n\n\n\u201cBloody hell!\u201d Peter said.\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a date!\u201d Remus said, slamming down his quill. As he said the words, he felt a horrible sinking feeling -\n\n\nhad\n\n\nit been a date? How were you supposed to know, if people just ambushed you like that?! He looked at James, desperately, \u201cBut I don\u2019t fancy Lily, she\u2019s just a friend!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I know, mate.\u201d James said, though Remus didn\u2019t think he sounded very sure. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll\u2026 see you after practice.\u201d\n\n\nWith that, James got up and left the table. Sirius stared after him for a moment, then looked at Remus, then back at James, before shrugging helplessly and getting up to follow his friend out of the hall. Peter followed shortly after, and Remus lay his head on the table, groaning.\n\n\n\u201cWow, sorry, Remus,\u201d Marlene said, very quietly, \u201cI had no idea. Um\u2026 James really fancies her, then?\u201d\n\n\nRemus groaned again, before getting up and grabbing his books.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m off to the library.\u201d He said, not looking at her.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t go to the library, though, in case Marlene went to find him there or - even worse - told Lily and Mary where he was. For the first time since his second year, Remus went into hiding.\n\n\nThe problem with this, of course, was how much he\u2019d grown since his second year. Many of his usual nooks and crannies were simply too small now. In the end, he settled himself behind the statue of the hump-backed witch, just inside the passageway to Honeyduke\u2019s. It was dark, but he lit his wand for light, and the faint smell of chocolate was very comforting.\n\n\nHe tried to read, but his brain wouldn\u2019t let him concentrate - it seemed to just want to keep playing his visit to Hogsmeade over and over again. Had Lily said something he had missed? Had it been in her body language, maybe; had she dropped hints? Would James have understood them? Would Sirius have? It was very unfair, Remus thought to himself, pitifully. Lily was a very good friend, why would she want to muddle it all up with feelings and holding hands, and\n\n\nkissing\n\n\n?!\n\n\nHe really hoped he wouldn\u2019t have to talk to her about it, now. Maybe she was just as embarrassed as he was. Worst of all, what if James never spoke to him again? He didn\u2019t know how to explain that he didn\u2019t see Lily in that way - not when every other Gryffindor in their year seemed hellbent on coupling up.\n\n\nMaybe he ought to have snogged Marlene when she\u2019d offered, back in November. He wondered if they\u2019d all leave him alone once he got it over with.\n\n\nYou have to start snogging girls\n\n\nsome\n\n\ntime\n\n\n, he told himself.\n\n\nEverybody does - it\u2019s normal.\n\n\nBut not Lily - he couldn\u2019t do that to James. In fact, Remus decided, that was probably the very reason he wasn\u2019t interested in her - because she was otherwise extremely pretty, funny, kind, clever - and better than him at Charms. Lily was\n\n\njust\n\n\nthe sort of girl he would fancy, Remus knew for sure, it was just that his friendship with James was much more important.\n\n\nFeeling very enlightened and self-sacrificing, Remus emerged from his hiding place. He set off down the nearest staircase, planning to go to the quidditch pitch and catch the last few minutes of practice. After that he would do something nice for James - offer to read over his History essay or something. Yes, then everything would be right with the world again.\n\n\nBut, as Remus had once been told; the best laid plans often go wrong. He was just nearing the bottom of the grand staircase - taking it three steps at a time just because he could, and not really looking where he was going - he knocked headlong into another student coming up.\n\n\n\u201cWatch it,\n\n\nmudblood\n\n\n.\u201d Severus Snape snarled, scrambling to his feet, glaring at Remus. Remus tutted,\n\n\n\u201cPiss off Snivellus, I\u2019m as much a half-blood as you are.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou and I have\n\n\nnothing\n\n\nin common, I assure you.\u201d Snape replied haughtily, brushing off his robes.\n\n\n\u201cI suppose when it comes to hygiene standards--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCareful, Loony Lupin,\u201d Snape narrowed his beady eyes, \u201cDon\u2019t say something you\u2019ll regret.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, bugger off,\u201d Remus replied, impatiently, stepping forward, \u201cI haven\u2019t got time for this, either curse me now or get out of my way.\u201d\n\n\nSnape stepped to the side at once, giving a flourish with his hand to show Remus that he was free to go. It was disquieting, but Remus couldn\u2019t worry about that now, and continued on his way."

            "content": "James Potter was a much more complex person than he appeared at first glance.\n\n\nOutwardly, he was happy, self-assured, usually kind (if a little bit arrogant), and generally popular with everybody. He got a lot of detentions, yes, but on the whole he got good marks, and most of the teachers were still quite fond of him. He made the most of being on the quidditch team - messing up his hair deliberately so that he looked like he had just finished flying, wearing his red robes at every opportunity. But no one could say that he hadn\u2019t earned the right - you only had to see him play to know that his big-headedness was not misplaced.\n\n\nAbove all, James Potter was loved. His parents spoilt him and instilled in him the notion that there was nothing he couldn\u2019t do; that no door would ever be closed to him. Sirius, Peter and Remus all looked up to him, appointing him leader in almost every venture, and all in all, he was admired throughout the school by everyone who mattered, and envied by everyone else.\n\n\nExcept for Lily Evans, of course. She was the thread that seemed to unravel everything else in James\u2019s life. Having grown up surrounded by love - freely given and carelessly accepted - James found it very troubling that someone he liked might not like him back. It was the reason he acted like an idiot whenever Lily was present, and the reason that he stopped talking to Remus for a week during the early spring of 1975.\n\n\nHe wasn\u2019t being nasty, or doing it deliberately - Remus knew James well enough to understand that. It was just that his feelings had been hurt and - as someone who had rarely experienced hurt feelings - wasn\u2019t sure how to handle it. At least Sirius blew up at you when you annoyed him, so that it could be quickly solved. Peter would sulk, and Remus would probably try to throw a punch. But James just went\n\n\nquiet\n\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not angry with you,\u201d Sirius explained, when James went to bed one night as soon as Remus arrived in the common room. \u201cHe\u2019s just feeling sorry for himself.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe does believe me, though, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Remus asked, anxiously, \u201cI really didn\u2019t know it was a date, I don\u2019t like Lily in that way!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t think he thinks you\u2019re lying, exactly, but\u2026 you are pretty close to Evans, aren\u2019t you? Always going around together.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s my\n\n\nfriend\n\n\n.\u201d Remus said, exasperated, \u201cI go \u2018round with Marlene and Mary too, no one thinks I\u2019m going out with them!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cActually,\u201d Sirius smirked, \u201cThere was a rumour last term\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh for god\u2019s sake!\u201d\n\n\nIt was impossible.\n\n\nAs for Lily, she was being reliably mature about the whole thing. Remus assumed Marlene had filled her in on the situation, but she didn\u2019t press it, and they were able to continue as Potions partners as normal. James and Sirius, however, had moved their workstation to the back of the room.\n\n\nBy Friday dinner time, Remus was truly miserable. Unlike James, he had not grown up surrounded by love, and he found that his friendship with the marauders had become so important that he suffered deeply from the loss of it. He still sat with them for meals, but there was an uneasy quiet instead of their usual raucous banter. Sirius kept trying to turn the conversation towards the upcoming Gryffindor vs. Slytherin match, but that only seemed to darken the mood.\n\n\nMaking matters worse, Lily, Mary and Marlene had sat themselves close to Remus - they were feeling sorry for him, and, being girls, were trying to cheer him up by doing exactly the wrong thing.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the match,\u201d Mary smiled, cheerfully, \u201cAll of the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws I\u2019ve spoken to are supporting Gryffindor too.\u201d\n\n\nLily sighed, heavily,\n\n\n\u201cWhy does it always have to be so black and white? No one\u2019s good all over or bad all over, not even Slytherins.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame us, Lily,\u201d Marlene replied, \u201cEven if it\u2019s not all of them, most of the Slytherins have been utterly foul this year.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSpeak of the devil\u2026\u201d Mary lowered her voice, suddenly, shooting a filthy look over Lily\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\nLily and Remus turned around to see Severus Snape standing there, with an odd smile on his face that was anything but joyful.\n\n\n\u201cHello, Lily,\u201d he said, softly.\n\n\n\u201cHi Sev,\u201d Lily replied, with a forced sort of politeness, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI just thought I\u2019d check to see if you wanted any extra help with the Potions assignment. It\u2019s very complex,\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\n\n\nknow\n\n\n.\u201d She replied, irritated, \u201cBut I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll manage--\u201d\n\n\n*BANG*\n\n\nEveryone at the table jumped and spun around to stare at the end of the hall, where Mulciber had just let off a firecracker at the far end of the Slytherin table. He was laughing heartily as the whole school looked on, terrified.\n\n\n\u201cFive points from Slytherin!\u201d McGonagall shouted, marching up the aisle between the tables, \u201cAnd you\u2019ll clean that mess up at once\u2026\u201d\n\n\nDinner returned to normal. Snape was still standing there. Lily looked up at him,\n\n\n\u201cAs I said, Remus and I will manage.\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019m not stupid, you know, Severus.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI never said you were\u2026\u201d Snape looked genuinely upset by this, \u201cI just\u2026 oh, never mind.\u201d With that, he cast an unpleasant glance at Remus, then swept away, back to his own table.\n\n\n\u201cWeirdo.\u201d Mary muttered.\n\n\n\u201cLeave him alone.\u201d Lily snapped. She looked so fierce that Mary didn\u2019t even have a comeback.\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 have any of you had any luck with that hinkypunk essay?\u201d Marlene asked quickly, trying to keep the peace. \u201cMine\u2019s crap.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll lend you my notes, if you want,\u201d Remus offered, taking a gulp of pumpkin juice. \u201cOnce Sirius gives them back\u2026\u201d\n\n\nSirius looked up, hearing his name spoken,\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah, sorry Moony, hang on, they\u2019re in my bag\u2026\u201d He began digging around in the junkyard that was his book bag, pulling out scrunched up balls of parchment, dungbombs, sweets and broken quills.\n\n\n\u201cHow do you find anything in there?\u201d Remus sighed, sipping some more pumpkin juice, \u201cYou\u2019re the messiest person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\n\n\nSirius shrugged and winked at him, withdrawing the notes and handing them to Marlene.\n\n\n\u201cOooh, Remus,\u201d Mary said, \u201cDid I tell you I had another letter from Darren this week?\u201d\n\n\nRemus groaned,\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d He whined, \u201cAnd it was just as boring as the last five hundred letters you\u2019ve made me read.\u201d\n\n\nSirius snorted. Marlene dropped her fork. Mary looked horrified, and opened and closed her mouth a few times. Remus frowned - why on earth had he said that? Of course, it was true, but it was horribly thoughtless and mean.\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, looking down. He felt strange. Maybe the James thing was getting to him even more than he thought.\n\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Mary said, standing up, her lower lip trembling, \u201cI won\u2019t bore you anymore, then!\u201d She turned quickly and left the room, her plate of food half eaten.\n\n\n\u201cMary!\u201d Marlene got up, running to follow her. Lily looked at Remus,\n\n\n\u201cDid you mean that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d He said promptly, \u201cActually I find all of this boyfriend-girlfriend stuff boring, I wish you\u2019d all just leave me alone.\u201d Once he\u2019d stopped talking, he blinked, surprised at himself. Why was he saying these things?!\n\n\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Lily said, looking shocked - though made of sterner stuff than Mary, she didn\u2019t leave, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with Mary wanting to talk about her boyfriend or\u2026 um\u2026 or teenagers having crushes, it\u2019s normal, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s normal.\u201d He shrugged, \u201cI think you\u2019re all acting like idiots. Even you - why on earth would you want to go out with me, when the most popular boy in the school is madly in love with you? He\u2019s ten times nicer than me, too, you\u2019re just too arrogant to see it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Lily said again, turning red.\n\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s true!\u201d He said, helplessly.\n\n\n\u201cMoony,\u201d Sirius said, finally, \u201cAre you ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, still a bit hungry, though. Think Mary will mind if I finish her potatoes?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSeriously, Remus,\u201d James piped up, unexpectedly, \u201cThis isn\u2019t like you at all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just being honest.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, brutally hone-- oh Merlin!\u201d Sirius slapped his forehead, \u201cEvans, did Snape put something in his drink? When the firework went off, maybe?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe would never do something like that, it\u2019s illegal!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPffft.\u201d Remus snorted, mouth full of mashed potato, \u201cAs if Snivellus gives a toss! He\u2019s been trying to get back at me ever since I hit him on the train.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou what?!\u201d Lily stared at him,\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus swallowed, \u201cNutted him right in the head, it was great.\u201d He knew there was definitely something wrong now, but he couldn\u2019t seem to help it. The truth just came spilling out of him.\n\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Sirius stood up, \u201cStop talking, Moony, before you say something you\u2019ll really regret.\u201d\n\n\nThose words dislodged a memory in Remus\u2019s mind,\n\n\n\u201cY\u2019know,\u201d he grinned, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what Snape said on the stairs the other day\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSEVERUS!\u201d Lily shouted, at the top of her voice. She got up and stormed over to the Slytherin table, Sirius, James, Remus and Peter in tow. \u201cWhat have you done to Remus?!\u201d She demanded, stamping her foot angrily on the flagstone floor.\n\n\n\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d Severus smirked, cruelly,\n\n\n\u201cYou tell me how to fix him right now!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with him,\u201d Severus replied calmly, \u201cIs there, Remus?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNothing really,\u201d Remus shrugged, \u201cI do keep saying things I shouldn\u2019t, though, like--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSHUT UP.\u201d Sirius kicked him, hard in the shin, distracting Remus from spilling his guts to Snape. Sirius now rounded on the Slytherin boy, \u201cYou bastard, it\u2019s\n\n\nveritaserum\n\n\n, isn\u2019t it?! Truth potion!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOne way to find out,\u201d Severus\u2019s smile broadened, \u201cWhat\u2019s your deepest, darkest secret, Lupin?\u201d\n\n\nOh god, where to start? Remus thought to himself. He knew he shouldn't say anything.\n\n\nMustn\u2019t\n\n\nsay anything. He would be in such terrible danger if anyone found out\u2026 but he wanted to, he wanted to very badly - he had so many secrets, and they were all swimming to the surface of his mind, like lifebuoys.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m a werewolf. I\u2019m planning to hunt down and murder Fenrir Greyback. I spent the whole summer stealing and drinking and fighting. I can\u2019t read properly without help. I\u2019m secretly running an illegal trade in muggle cigarettes. I don\u2019t fancy girls at all, not any of them. I don\u2019t think I ever will.\n\n\nHe opened his mouth,\n\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m a---\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSILENCIO!\u201d Sirius shouted, suddenly, aiming his wand at Remus, while James tackled him to the floor, clamping a hand over his mouth.\n\n\nEveryone on the Slytherin table burst out laughing as James and Remus struggled together on the floor, Lily watching them, completely nonplussed. Remus\u2019s mouth kept moving, desperate to divulge every one of his secrets, until he was completely free of them - but not a sound escaped his lips. Sirius was excellent at silencing charms.\n\n\nTogether, Peter, Sirius and James hoisted Remus to his feet, and dragged him bodily from the dining hall, amid a flurry of laughter and jeers from the Slytherins. Only once they were all upstairs and shut inside their dorm room did Sirius lift the charm, allowing Remus to speak. By then, fortunately, the urge to tell everyone everything had passed.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, Remus,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cBut I had to do it, you were going to--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Remus hung his head, sitting on his bed, \u201cBloody Snape! How long does it take to wear off?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDepends on how much you took, I think.\u201d James said, flicking through his potions book, \u201cGodric, how did he do it?! That\u2019s NEWT level stuff, truth serum!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the best in the year at Potions,\u201d Remus supplied, unwillingly, \u201cLily said he\u2019s already doing seventh year essays, just for fun.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat a boring old swot.\u201d Sirius snorted, joining James in searching through the book, \u201cTry not to say anything, Moony, ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d Remus said, without meaning to.\n\n\n\u201cOk, right, it says here you should be clear within twenty four hours, so\u2026 dinner time tomorrow, at the very latest.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat about lessons?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll say you\u2019re sick. You can\u2019t risk it, Moony! I could\n\n\nkill\n\n\nSnape, that filthy, dirty, underhanded\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not missing any lessons for him.\u201d Remus folded his arms, \u201cThere must be an antidote.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe could go and ask Slughorn?\u201d James said, finally.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, good idea, I think he\u2019s still in the Great Hall,\u201d Sirius nodded. He turned to Remus, and spoke very clearly and slowly, as if he was talking to a child, \u201cRemus. Stay. Here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBugger off,\u201d Remus turned away, pouting like a little boy.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay with him.\u201d James said. \u201cYou two go.\u201d\n\n\nSirius needed no more than that, and he was bounding down the stairs, calling back,\n\n\n\u201cHang in there Moony! If I see a Slytherin on my way down, then I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d\n\n\nBut they couldn\u2019t hear the rest; Sirius had gone, and Peter with him. There was a long, awkward silence. Remus didn\u2019t trust himself to speak. Finally, James did.\n\n\n\u201cSorry I\u2019ve been a bit of a prat, lately.\u201d\n\n\nRemus was taken aback, and shook his head fiercely,\n\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been! I just wish I could prove to you that I\u2026 wait! Ask me!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAsk me now, while I\u2019m under a truth serum; ask me how I feel about Lily. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s the truth.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus, I don\u2019t want to,\u201d James frowned. It didn\u2019t mesh with his idea of good sportsmanship.\n\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d Remus encouraged, \u201cI really don\u2019t mind - it\u2019s between you and me, right?\u201d He got up and grabbed James by the shoulders, meeting his eyes with confidence, \u201cAsk me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 ok then. Remus, do you fancy Lily Evans?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo. Absolutely not.\u201d Remus didn\u2019t so much as blink.\n\n\n\u201cOk, good... What about Marlene?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNope. Never have, never will. They\u2019re my friends, like you are.\u201d\n\n\nJames looked at him very intently, then his face broke into a genuine smile. He slapped Remus on the back.\n\n\n\u201cThanks, Moony, you\u2019re a real mate.\u201d\n\n\nRemus laughed,\n\n\n\u201cAny time.\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nFortunately for Remus, Slughorn was able to provide an antidote almost immediately - though the marauders\u2019 code of honour prevented them from telling him who had laced Remus\u2019s drink in the first place.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better this way,\u201d Remus assured them, \u201cIt\u2019ll make him really nervous if he doesn\u2019t get in trouble straight away - he\u2019ll wonder how we\u2019re going to get him back.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow\n\n\nare\n\n\nwe going to get him back?\u201d Sirius asked, eagerly, over breakfast on the morning of the Slytherin v Gryffindor game, \u201cHe nearly outed you, Moony, we have to teach him a lesson!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLet me think about it.\u201d Remus replied. \u201cJust thrash Slytherin at quidditch for me, first.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEasy,\u201d Sirius winked. Remus grinned back. It was hard not to grin at Sirius when he was in such a good mood - resplendent in his scarlet and gold quidditch robes, hair pulled off his face, eyes sharp and full of determination. It was the best version of Sirius, and Remus\u2019s heart pounded with pride and adrenaline.\n\n\nThe tension was palpable in the quidditch stands before the players had even appeared on the pitch. Two quarters of the stadium was covered in red, jeering and booing at the green section. Quidditch had become a way for the students of Hogwarts to truly show their emotions about the war - and it was extremely ugly.\n\n\n\u201cTensions are high in this year\u2019s semi-final,\u201d the commentator, Tracey Darcy, spoke through her magical megaphone, \u201cThis match will of course determine which team goes through to the final against Ravenclaw, and by the looks of the players, it\u2019ll be a close one\u2026 On Gryffindor we have Potter, of course, a legend in his own right with more than two hundred goals under his belt already\u2026 Marlene McKinnon there, a formidable beater - and so she should be, her brother Danny McKinnon of course plays professionally for the Chudley Cannons\u2026 and there\u2019s Sirius Black, Gryffindor\u2019s second beater, in his second game of the year\u2026 Black has already shown himself to be as competent as McKinnon, and I\u2019m sure all the ladies will agree, doesn\u2019t look half bad in his kit\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAhem.\u201d McGonagall\u2019s disapproving cough could be heard over the megaphone. Remus noticed than almost every girl in the crowd was either giggling, or screaming Sirius\u2019s name.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, professor\u2026\u201d Tracey continued, \u201c..and here comes Slytherin,\u201d (deafening booing from the crowd, here), \u201cThey have their very own Black on the team, of course, Sirius\u2019s younger brother, Regulus - seeker\u2026 and Mulciber, taken on as beater this term\u2026\u201d\n\n\nThe boos grew so loud now that Remus could barely hear Darcy over the noise. Peter wasn\u2019t helping, and kept jumping up and down in his seat. Remus was staying seated as long as he could - his hip was causing him problems again, and he didn\u2019t want to exacerbate it. \u2018Limpy Lupin\u2019 was worse than \u2018Loony Lupin\u2019, somehow.\n\n\nFinally the game began, and the both teams shot into the air with incredible force. If the crowd was mean, the players were even worse - with the weight of their houses on their shoulders it felt like a matter of life or death. Remus had never seen James play so hard; rocketing up and down the pitch like a red bullet, catching and throwing the quaffle faster than the Slytherin keeper could keep track of.\n\n\nSirius and Marlene were equally fearsome, both working as much more of a team than they had last time, clearly communicating and watching the backs of their fellow teammates. And they really needed to - Slytherin was playing dirty. Twice Sirius had to fend off a bludger that had \u2018accidentally\u2019 flown right into James\u2019s path, while Marlene became the Gryffindor seeker\u2019s shadow, protecting him from some very nasty near-misses.\n\n\nRemus was so busy watching his three friends - wincing when they came close to danger; cheering their victories - that he had quite forgotten the aim of the game. So had everyone else, it seemed, except for Regulus Black, who flew high above the pitch, and then around the outskirts, showing that infamous Slytherin cunning as he sought out the snitch.\n\n\nNo one was watching as Regulus Black, the smallest Slytherin team member, caught sight of the tiny golden ball and began to soar down towards it from his incredible height. No one was watching Regulus Black, because they were all watching Sirius swing his bat at a bludger that would have easily knocked him off his broom. He hit it back so hard that it shot straight back towards Mulciber\u2019s face. Mulciber, though stupid, was not slow, and swooped down immediately, ducking out of the way - just as Regulus passed behind him.\n\n\n\nNow\n\n\nRemus saw him - now everybody did, and a terrible shriek went up as the bludger connected with Regulus\u2019s head and knocked him from his broom.\n\n\nThey watched in such horror that all house prejudice was forgotten, as the limp body of Regulus Black plummeted to the ground."

            "content": "Remus almost missed what happened, because everyone in the crowd immediately stood up, jostling to see the disaster unfold - fortunately, when Remus stood up he was a good deal taller than those around him.\n\n\nSirius tried - no one could deny that. The moment he saw the bludger hit Regulus, he bent flat on his broom and shot forward as if the devil was at his heels, faster than Remus had ever seen anyone - even James - fly. In fact, Sirius gathered such a speed, and at such a terrifying vertical angle, that Remus felt sure he was going to crash to the ground too, and his stomach lurched with fear. Sirius was too late, but Madam Hooch was not.\n\n\nShe stood on the grass, wand raised, and managed to slow Regulus\u2019s descent, so that his body appeared to be falling through water, not air. By the time Sirius hit the ground, dropping his broom and pelting towards his brother, Regulus was lying so peacefully he could have been sleeping.\n\n\nSirius was on his knees, the rest of the team were landing around him, McGonagall was shouting something over the megaphone and a crowd quickly surrounded the two Black brothers, so that no one could see anything. Remus began to hobble down the wooden steps as quickly as his wonky hip would allow. Peter scurried along behind him,\n\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d He panted,\n\n\n\u201cSirius.\u201d Was all Remus could think to say.\n\n\nBut once they reached ground level they couldn\u2019t get onto the pitch; the heads of houses were shepherding students back into the castle, and wouldn\u2019t let them past.\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have taken Regulus to the hospital wing,\u201d Peter said, \u201cMaybe Sirius is in the changing rooms?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Remus shook his head, \u201cNo, he\u2019d want to go with Reg\u2026 he probably thinks it\u2019s all his fault.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Peter looked up at him, \u201cHe did hit the bludger, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\nRemus clenched his fists and fought the urge to hit Peter.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to the hospital wing, then.\u201d He turned and began to stride awkwardly towards the castle, trying to get ahead of everyone else.\n\n\n\u201cWhat about James?\u201d Peter had to jog to keep up.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be there too.\u201d Remus replied.\n\n\nAnd of course he was. When Peter and Remus arrived outside the hospital wing, having battled their way through the throngs of gossiping students, they found James sitting on the floor outside, elbows resting on his knees, staring into space. He was still in his quidditch robes, his cheeks were still flushed from flying, and his hair was a mess.\n\n\n\u201cIs he ok?!\u201d Remus asked, at once - and he wasn\u2019t sure who he meant.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, think so,\u201d James looked up at them in dazed surprise, \u201cKnocked out cold, though. Pomfrey wont let me in.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSirius?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s in there. Thought I\u2019d better wait\u2026 Slughorn\u2019s contacting their parents, so.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThought I\u2019d better be here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all here.\u201d Remus said, firmly, sitting down next to James with some difficulty. His hip was really sore, now; the pain shot all the way down from pelvis to ankle. Peter eventually squatted down too, and they waited.\n\n\n\u201cDid you see what happened?\u201d James asked, finally. \u201cI was on the other end of the pitch, I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA bludger,\u201d Remus said, \u201cMulciber hit one right at Sirius, it had to be a foul. Sirius hit it back at him, but Mulciber got out of the way, and Regulus was right behind him. Sirius can\u2019t have seen him; it was an accident. It was\u2026 it was horrible.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShit.\u201d James said.\n\n\nThey were quiet for a bit longer. It was starting to grow dark, and the candles in the sconces along the wall opposite began to light themselves. Remus wondered what James and Peter were thinking. Were they more worried about Sirius than Regulus, like he was? He felt a bit guilty - but Madam Pomfrey had been putting him back together since he was eleven years old, and he didn\u2019t think that a bludger to the head was beyond her abilities. What concerned him more was the state Sirius would be in. He had thrown hexes at Regulus a hundred times, but he had never, ever, hurt his little brother intentionally. This hadn\u2019t been intentional either, but Remus knew in his gut that Sirius wouldn\u2019t see it that way.\n\n\nThey were disturbed from their thoughts by the quick clacking of high heels on flagstones, and Professor McGonagall\u2019s worried voice coming around the corner,\n\n\n\u201cPlease, Walpurga, he couldn\u2019t be in safer hands with Madam Pomfrey - it\u2019s really best that he isn\u2019t moved--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think\n\n\nI\n\n\nshall be making the decisions here, Minerva.\u201d That cold, low voice replied.\n\n\nJames and Peter leapt up, nervously, and James bent to help Remus to his feet. None of them had seen Sirius\u2019s mother since that awful Christmas two years ago, and their terror of her was still fresh. McGonagall and Mrs Black came marching around the corner; Walpurga in her thick black travelling cloak and sharp high heeled boots. She had that same look of cruel superiority Remus remembered, but her forehead was creased, too, and her hair wasn\u2019t as neat as usual.\n\n\nShe was accompanied by a small, elderly wizard with a long trailing beard, carrying a heavy looking dragonskin case. Walpurga glanced at the three boys waiting outside the hospital wing and Remus held his breath - but she didn\u2019t seem to think it worth her time, and strode past, pushing the wooden doors open with both hands and marching inside.\n\n\nRemus, James and Peter peered in from the hallway to watch the scene unfold. McGonagall and the bearded wizard hurried in after Mrs Black.\n\n\nRegulus was lying in a bed, and from what they could tell was still unconscious - or maybe just sleeping. With his eyes closed, and at a distance, he looked remarkably like Sirius, which made Remus\u2019s stomach lurch again. But Sirius was sitting beside him, wide awake in his red Gryffindor robes, one foot propped up on a stool. He looked very pale, and much smaller than usual; his eyes were red. He seemed to shrink even further as his mother approached, swooping towards her sons like some terrible vampire bat.\n\n\nMadam Pomfrey stepped in, just then,\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s quite all right, just a heavy knock,\u201d she said, reassuringly, \u201cI\u2019ve given him a healing draught and mended the fractures.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFractures?\u201d Walpurga said, sharply. She stood at the end of Regulus\u2019s bed, looking down at him. She didn\u2019t try to reach out for him, or Sirius, but stood still as a statue.\n\n\n\u201cVery minor, and completely healed now.\u201d Madam Pomfrey said, \u201cHe\u2019ll be up and about by tomorrow morning. Now, Sirius has--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis is our family physician,\u201d Walpurga interrupted, extending a hand to introduce the wizened old man beside her, \u201cHe will be taking over my son\u2019s care. I\u2019m taking him home as soon as he has been thoroughly examined.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, everything that can been done has been done.\u201d Madam Pomfrey said, sounding rather angry now.\n\n\nWalpurga looked down at her imperiously,\n\n\n\u201cWithin your competence, I am sure. But he is my son and I will care for him as I see fit.\u201d\n\n\nMadam Pomfrey turned red in the face, and appeared to be quite speechless, so that McGonagall had to lean over and whisper something in her ear to mollify her. The old bearded wizard placed his case on the bedside table and opened it, before silently bending over Regulus.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Walpurga had turned her attention to her elder son. She did not move from the end of the bed, but her hawkish glare was enough to hold Sirius in place.\n\n\n\u201cYou.\u201d She said. \u201cAnd what are you doing here?\u201d\n\n\nSirius said something, but it came out barely above a whisper. Walpurga frowned,\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d She barked, \u201cSpeak up, boy!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s my brother.\u201d Sirius said, louder now, though his voice was hoarse and cracked slightly. Mrs Black tutted.\n\n\n\u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake, have you\n\n\nbeen\n\n\ncrying?! Try to show at least a modicum of decorum.\n\n\nToujours Pur\n\n\n, Sirius!\n\n\nTry\n\n\nto remember your duty.\u201d\n\n\nSirius did not reply, but bowed his head, his fair falling in front of his face. Remus hoped for his sake that he hadn\u2019t begun to cry again. Walpurga continued, \u201cYou may leave, Sirius. Your father and I will see you in June.\u201d\n\n\nWith that, she turned back to Regulus, and did not acknowledge Sirius again. James started forward, unable to watch any longer, but Remus held back with Peter. It didn\u2019t feel like his place, somehow; he didn\u2019t have the right. And though Remus wished more than anything he knew what to do, James was always so much better with Sirius.\n\n\nMcGonagall had apparently seen James, and acted quickly, placing a hand on Sirius\u2019s shoulder and gently guiding in out of his chair and towards the doorway. He was limping, slightly. Madam Pomfrey joined them halfway, and handed Sirius a draught too.\n\n\n\u201cStraight up to bed and drink every drop, you hear me? You shouldn\u2019t be in too much pain, but it\u2019ll be uncomfortable tonight.\u201d\n\n\nSirius nodded, wearily, not speaking. James clapped him on the shoulder and squeezed, then nodded to McGonagall. She looked like she very much wanted to say something, but held her tongue, only glancing back at Regulus and Mrs Black. She would keep an eye on the situation, Remus was sure. She would let Sirius know if anything happened.\n\n\nThe four marauders walked most of the way to Gryffindor tower together in dead silence until they came to a dual staircase, and Peter suddenly said,\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve missed dinner.\u201d\n\n\nJames and Remus glared at him, and he looked very hurt. \u201cWhat I\n\n\nmeant\n\n\n,\u201d he squeaked, angrily, \u201cWas that I\u2019ll go down to the kitchens now and get them to send something up. If that\u2019s ok with you two?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNice one, Pete.\u201d James said, apologetically.\n\n\nRemus just ducked his head, looking away. Peter turned tail and headed downstairs, while the other three kept going upwards. It was slow progress considering two of them had pronounced limps.\n\n\n\u201cRight state we must look.\u201d Sirius muttered, humourlessly, as they paused on one of the landings for a breather.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, anyway?\u201d Remus finally asked, rubbing his aching hip.\n\n\n\u201cBroke my ankle,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cLanded too hard on it.\u201d\n\n\nJames winced. Sirius shrugged, \u201cCan\u2019t feel it, just a bit wobbly.\u201d\n\n\nWhen they finally reached their bedroom, Sirius locked himself inside the bathroom to shower and change. Peter shortly reappeared, laden with sandwiches, fruit, chocolate, cakes and everything else he could carry.\n\n\n\u201cBunch of girls down there want to see Sirius,\u201d he huffed, dumping everything onto his bed, \u201cThere\u2019s a gang of second years all making him get well cards - told \u2018em to bugger off.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks Pete,\u201d James said, \u201cYou\u2019re a good mate.\u201d\n\n\nPeter smiled, finally. He nodded at the closed bathroom door.\n\n\n\u201cHe ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe will be.\u201d James sighed, stripping off his quidditch robes, leaving them in a pile on the floor. In just his vest and underwear, he grabbed a chicken sandwich from Peter\u2019s bed and bit into it hungrily. Remus and Peter took this as permission and followed suit.\n\n\nSirius was in the bathroom for a long time, and they thought it best to leave him to it. James changed into his usual clothes and began tidying Sirius\u2019s eternally messy bed. Remus helped, collecting up the scattered books and half finished essays. He would finish them, Remus decided, he would do all of Sirius\u2019s homework for the entire week, if it helped at all.\n\n\n\u201cI fucking hate his family.\u201d James said, suddenly, as he shook out one of Sirius\u2019s pillows.\n\n\n\u201cHis mum\u2019s even worse than mine,\u201d Peter sniffed. Remus began to sort through Sirius\u2019s notes, smoothing out the parchments and trying to make sense of what was due when.\n\n\nThe bathroom door clicked, and Sirius emerged in his pyjamas, his hair wet and combed back.\n\n\n\u201cYou hungry, mate?\u201d Peter asked, nervously, offering a plate of sandwiches. Sirius shook his head and walked towards his bed.\n\n\n\u201cJust gonna go to sleep.\u201d He murmured, pulling the curtains across.\n\n\n\u201cSirius!\u201d Remus burst out, before he completely disappeared from view. Sirius stopped, staring at him through the gap in the hanging. Remus chewed his lip, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d He said. \u201cI was watching; it was an accident. You were both just so focussed on the game, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\nSirius looked at him, his face soft after the shower, his eyes tired and dark. He smiled gently and shrugged.\n\n\n\u201cStill did it.\u201d Then drew the curtains tight shut.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThe quidditch game was declared incomplete, and both teams agreed to a re-match once the Slytherins had found another seeker. The next morning at breakfast, the Slytherin captain received a howler from Walpurga Black, accusing him of putting her son in danger. Regulus was not present, and rumours abounded, but McGonagall had privately told Sirius that all was well - Mrs Black simply wished to keep Regulus at home for a further week as a precaution.\n\n\nSirius carried on about his day, but the light in him had dimmed. He didn\u2019t hex anyone, make jokes, or even talk out of turn in his lessons. He simply pushed through, as if sleepwalking. Remus was starting to wonder whether it was still the shock of the accident, or the anxiety of having to face his mother inside Hogwarts.\n\n\nThat night was the full moon, so Remus could be of little help to Sirius. Actually, he was a little bit glad to have the excuse to get away from the dorm room, which had become a dismal, quiet place while Sirius was in his mood. \u00a0Remus wasn\u2019t the only one - Peter kept slipping away to visit Desdemona.\n\n\nPerhaps it was all of the quiet, all of the unsaid things and unresolved tension, but February\u2019s moon was a bad one. Remus awoke with his throat burnt raw from howling, splinters under his fingernails and bruises all over.\n\n\nLately he\u2019d noticed that the older he got, the more he was able to remember after the transformations. It still wasn\u2019t very clear; like remembering a dream; images and feelings swimming in and out of sight, but this time Remus thought that maybe the wolf had wanted something - maybe it had wanted to get out more than usual.\n\n\nHe lay in the hospital bed trying to remember, feverish and headachy, too uncomfortable to sleep, sheets twisted around his ankles like manacles.\n\n\n\u201cMorning, Moony,\u201d A soft, sad voice spoke to him. He had to rub his eyes and blink a few times before he even realised it was Sirius.\n\n\n\u201cM-mornin\u2019,\u201d he slurred, groggy from whatever painkiller he\u2019d been supplied. It always made his accent slip, which he hated. \u201cWhat\u2019chu doin\u2019 \u2018ere?\u201d\n\n\nSirius sat on the end of the bed and stuck out his foot,\n\n\n\u201cCheck up on my ankle. It\u2019s fine now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, good.\u201d Remus nodded, trying to pull himself up into a sitting position, and failing miserably.\n\n\n\u201cHow was it?\u201d Sirius asked, gesturing broadly at Remus\u2019s body.\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Remus replied, \u201cNormal. James \u2018ere too?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d Sirius looked down at his shoes, \u201cGiving him a break from me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he minds..\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI do, though.\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded. He didn\u2019t like being fussed over either.\n\n\n\u201cMoony?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know how you said it wasn\u2019t my fault?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\n\n\nwasn\u2019t\n\n\nyour fault.\u201d Remus said, firmly. A little bit too firmly, he felt the muscles in his throat strain and contract and he began to cough. Sirius hopped off the bed and grabbed the glass of water from the nightstand, handing it to Remus. Remus gulped it down, embarrassed, spilling a bit down his front.\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hit him on purpose, you\u2019re right,\u201d Sirius said, looking out of the window over Remus\u2019s head, squinting slightly as if he was looking for something out there. \u201cBut\u2026 when I saw him fall like that, I thought\u2026 I thought -\n\n\ndon\u2019t let him die\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, of course,\u201d Remus frowned. He wished Sirius would meet his eye. \u201cHe\u2019s your brother, of course you didn\u2019t want him to--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about him, though.\u201d Sirius said, \u201cI was thinking about me. I was thinking\u2026 if he dies, then I\u2019ll be the only one left, and my parents will\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t have any way out. I\n\n\nneed\n\n\nRegulus to stay alive. I need him to be the perfect son, so it doesn\u2019t matter that I\u2019m the bad son. That\u2019s what I was thinking. I\u2019m a coward.\u201d\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t know what to say, but he had to say something.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d still have been sorry if he died, though. Not just because of that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, but my first thought--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t think properly when they\u2019re scared. Believe me.\u201d Remus said, hoping he sounded authoritative. \u201cI saw you, you risked your life to try and save him - that\u2019s not cowardly. Broke your stupid ankle like the idiotic hard-headed Gryffindor you are.\u201d\n\n\nSirius exhaled, a strained little laugh. He looked at his feet again, then at Remus. Remus smiled at him, encouragingly, even though his jaw ached.\n\n\n\u201cReg gonna be ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, fine. Owled me this morning - being waited on hand and foot, sounds like. Mother tried to get me kicked off the team, too, but he stopped her.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere you go, then.\u201d Remus smirked, \u201cYou\u2019re still the bad son.\u201d\n\n\nSirius laughed."

Of course, the marauders were as pleased as ever to prove him wrong.\nAs usual, everything was planned with extreme secrecy, and Remus was completely unaware until the very last moment. It was the saturday before his birthday, and he had been lounging on his bed reading, with one of Sirius\u2019s records playing low in the background. He often borrowed the record player and camped out in his bed these days - Sirius never seemed to mind.\nIt was only about nine o\u2019clock, but he was alone, and considering an early night. Just as he had made his mind up to get into his pyjamas, Sirius burst into the room with a wicked grin on his face that could only mean one thing - it was going to be a long night.\n\u201cReady?!\u201d He said, bounding across the floor, bringing in the smell of woodsmoke from the common room fireplace.\n\u201cFor what?\u201d Remus asked calmly, marking his place and setting his book aside.\n\u201cFor your birthday surprise,\nobviously\n,\u201d Sirius sighed, as if Remus was being very slow. \u201cC\u2019mon, up you get, shoes on please - wear those mad muggle boots you\u2019ve got, with the crazy laces.\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 where are we going?\u201d\n\u201cOut.\u201d Sirius began digging around in his trunk. He withdrew a pair of muggle jeans and a plain black t-shirt.\n\u201cOh, you mean\nout\nout?\u201d Remus raised an eyebrow, as Sirius began to undress.\n\u201cYeah, take your cloak.\u201d\nSirius looked good in muggle clothes, Remus thought to himself. Really, most people looked better in a t-shirt and jeans than they did in a school uniform or seventeenth century robes - but Sirius wore everything well. Remus asked no further questions as he laced up his boots. It was clear that Sirius was enjoying the surprise, and he saw no reason to spoil it.\nHe was led down the stairs, feeling very odd in jeans and a travelling cloak, but still not complaining - Sirius probably thought they looked the height of muggle fashion. In the common room they were met by James and Peter, also grinning mischievously.\n\u201cYou know my birthday isn\u2019t for two days, yet.\u201d Remus said, a small smile of his own playing on his lips.\n\u201cTonight\u2019s events are time sensitive.\u201d Sirius replied, briskly. He was trying to retain an aloof air of mystery, but was clearly bursting to tell Remus everything.\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry,\u201d James said, eyes twinkling as he held back the portrait door to exit the common room; \u201cWe won\u2019t forget to sing for you on Monday at breakfast.\u201d\n\u201cAnd lunch,\u201d Peter added,\n\u201cAnd dinner.\u201d Sirius finished, now they were winding their way down the Gryffindor Tower staircase.\n\u201cUnder you go, lads.\u201d James said, throwing the heavy invisibility cloak over all four of them. As long as they all stayed very close together, and Remus hunched over, they\njust\nabout fit. It wouldn\u2019t stand another growth spurt from any of them, though.\nFortunately, they did not have to shuffle too far - as Remus had expected, they headed for the statue of the humpbacked witch and slipped behind it, into the tunnel which led to Honeyduke\u2019s.\n\u201cSo, fifteen!\u201d Sirius said cheerily as they walked, clapping Remus on the shoulder in what he must have considered a very manly sort of way. \u201cExcited?\u201d\nRemus shrugged,\n\u201cI never really thought about it. You tell me, you\u2019re the oldest.\u201d\n\u201cWell, obviously I\u2019m much wiser and more mature than the rest of you\u2026\u201d\nJames snorted, walking ahead with his wand lit. Sirius ignored him, \u201cI\u2019d rather be seventeen though. Then we could apparate, at least.\u201d\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t start,\u201d Peter huffed, bringing up the rear, \u201cHe actually wanted to try and learn to apparate, Remus, just for your birthday, so we could get into Hogsmeade easier.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t apparate inside Hogwarts.\u201d Remus said.\n\u201cTen points to Moony.\u201d Sirius grinned, \u201cWe could have apparated out of the cellar, though. Save us having to try and get past ol\u2019 Honeyduke.\u201d\n\u201cApparition is really hard though, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Remus asked. He secretly wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d be able to do it at all - even doing a side-along with Mr Potter that once had been exhausting and made him feel sick.\n\u201cYeah, but\nwe\ncould do it.\u201d Sirius replied, confidently.\n\u201cIt was a bit much on top of everything else we\u2019ve had to do this term, though,\u201d Peter said.\nSirius gave the smaller boy a very annoyed look, and Peter\u2019s mouth dropped open, as if he\u2019d said something very wrong.\n\u201cYou mean with exams coming up?\u201d Remus asked, innocently, to save Peter. He was amazed Pettigrew had managed to keep quiet for so long as it was - though it wasn\u2019t as if James and Sirius were half as discreet as they thought they were.\n\u201cYeah, exactly.\u201d Peter sounded relieved, \u201cExams. I\u2019m definitely going to fail History of Magic this year. Definitely. I\u2019ll never get an OWL in it.\u201d\nThey talked about next year\u2019s OWLs for a bit longer, bemoaning their own unpreparedness in this subject or that - though Remus was actually quite looking forward to them, especially the practical exams. Finally they reached the Honeyduke\u2019s cellar. And this was where the plan somewhat fell apart.\n\u201cBugger.\u201d James said, as he tried the locked door. \u201cHe\u2019s usually still up doing his accounts or whatever. Must have gone to bed early.\u201d\n\u201cOr he could be out,\u201d Remus suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s a saturday night.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are we going to do??\u201d Peter asked, \u201c\nAlohomora\n? Oh, but we can\u2019t do magic\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLet me see,\u201d Remus stepped forward, fiddling in his back pocket for the hairpin he\u2019d had since the summer. \u201cEasy,\u201d he said, inspecting the lock. He bent over it and inserted the pin, stroking it slowly upwards and listening carefully. The satisfying click told him it had worked, and he stepped back, opening the door with a flourish. \u201cTa-da!\u201d\n\u201cYou beauty!\u201d James cheered, \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go!\u201d\nOnce inside the shop, it was even easier, as that lock worked from the inside. Then, all of a sudden they were outside on Hogsmeade high street in the cold night air. It was deliciously thrilling, being somewhere they shouldn\u2019t - Remus didn\u2019t even care if they got away with it or not. He followed Sirius and James up the cobbled street, past the Three Broomsticks, the closed shops and post office.\nThe two excitable boys stopped abruptly outside another pub; one Remus hadn\u2019t been to before. The sign swinging above the entrance said\nThe Hogs Head\n, with an appropriately gory image beneath. There was an A-frame chalkboard on the pavement outside which read:\nLive Music Tonight! Open Mic, Muggle Tribute Acts!\n\u201cOh my god!!\u201d Remus exclaimed - this was absolutely the last thing he had expected. Now he knew why Sirius was grinning so broadly his cheeks must hurt.\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you think??\u201d The dark haired boy asked, eagerly.\n\u201cSirius promised us you\u2019d love it,\u201d James said, sounding less sure. Remus just stared at the chalkboard, then at Sirius,\n\u201cI love it.\u201d He confirmed.\nInside, it was neither very busy nor too quiet, and looked as though the first act was just setting up. It wasn\u2019t as nice as the three Broomsticks; there was staw on the floor rather than a carpet, and it smelled faintly of a farmyard, but Remus could see that they definitely weren\u2019t going to bump into anyone they knew - and no one was going to grass on them to the school.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get the first round in,\u201d Sirius said, merrily, mischief still twinkling in his eyes.\n\u201cSirius\u2026\u201d James said, sternly, \u201cButterbeers, yeah?\u201d\n\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSo,\u201d Remus said, as they settled themselves around a small, rickety table which was close enough to the band, but also in a gloomy corner just in case, \u201cMuggle tribute acts? Is that a normal thing for wizards to listen to?\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d James shook his head, looking just as baffled. \u201cThere\u2019s been a bit of a trend for it lately. Defying the dark lord and all his pureblood shite, that sort of thing.\u201d\n\u201cAre they going to play David Bowie?\u201d Peter asked. Poor Peter had the impression that muggle music began and ended with David Bowie, thanks to Sirius and Remus.\nThe band announced themselves as\nBanshee Blues\njust as Sirius returned with a tray of drinks. About fifteen of them.\n\u201cSirius!\u201d James raised his eyebrows,\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Sirius winked at him, \u201cI got you your butterbeer!\u201d\n\u201cI meant\njust\nbutterbeer, for all of us. How did you even get served? Is that firewhisky?\u201d\n\u201cAnd mead.\u201d Sirius nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t drink any if you don\u2019t want it. Here,\u201d He picked up a glass with about two inches of golden brown coloured liquid in it, raising it, \u201cTo our beloved Moony - inventor of the marauders map, architect of our greatest pranks, completer of our overdue homework\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTo Moony,\u201d The other two smirked. Remus looked at the band, too embarrassed to respond.\nHe had never seen live music performed before, let alone live music performed by wizards. Their clothes were predictably odd - a mix of traditional robes and assorted muggle garments - the lead singer wore a white stetson, for some reason, paired with a pink feather boa. The instruments looked muggleish enough, but they had no amplifiers - apparently magic took care of the volume.\nThey played a few Beatles songs, then some Rolling Stones, and Remus thought they were pretty good. Even James was tapping his foot along by the end, though that might have been due to Sirius sneaking measures of firewhisky into his butterbeer. Firewhisky was pretty foul, Remus thought, but no worse than the cheap vodka he\u2019d been knocking back last summer. He proudly swallowed his first glass in one, without wincing, and Sirius stared at him in awe.\nPeter stuck to mead, and kept asking, \u201cam I drunk yet? am I drunk?\u201d after every sip. After two flagons, he probably was.\n\u201cMaybe we should just stick to butterbeer now\u2026\u201d Remus said, eyeing Peter with concern. He was swaying on his stool slightly, pink cheeked and grinning. Banshee Blues were packing away their instruments, and a pale faced young woman with a drippy fringe approached the mic stand.\n\u201cThat you, Lupin?\u201d A young wizard approached them from the bar. Remus vaguely recognised him, but wasn\u2019t sure where from.\n\u201cEr\u2026 hi.\u201d He said, nervously.\n\u201cArnold Doyle! I was at Hogwarts last year, remember?\u201d He was tall and lanky, but so were half the boys at school. \u201cYour fags got me through my NEWTs!\u201d\n\u201cOh! Right, yeah, hi Arnold, sorry.\u201d He still wasn\u2019t sure he remembered him, but the whisky had made him feel friendly and warm towards everyone. \u201cWhat you doin\u2019 \u2018ere?\u201d\n\u201cGirlfriend\u2019s playing,\u201d he nodded up at the stage, where the drippy looking girl was tuning her acoustic guitar. \u201cWhat about you? Thought you were still at school?\u201d\n\u201cS\u2019my birthday,\u201d Remus grinned, \u201cSnuck out, innit.\u201d\nArnold laughed,\n\u201cGotcha. Well, I won\u2019t dob you in. Can I buy you a drink? Say thanks for the cigs?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re our kind of man, Arnold,\u201d Sirius called out, more loudly than he needed to in such a small pub, but he\u2019d been matching Remus drink for drink.\nArnold just laughed and went back to the bar. His girlfriend started playing - a Bob Dylan song, it sounded like, but Remus wasn\u2019t that familiar with folk. He still couldn\u2019t remember ever having sold Arnold anything, but Arnold clearly felt a debt was owed, because he bought Remus an entire bottle of firewhisky and set it down on the table.\n\u201cHappy birthday! Come of age, have you?\u201d\n\u201cActually--\u201d Peter started, then stopped as Sirius kicked him hard under the table.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus replied smoothly, \u201cCheers!\u201d\nAfter that, things went a bit wobbly, but he definitely decided smoking was a good idea - and Sirius, keen not to be outdone, agreed.\n\u201cThose things stink, Moony.\u201d James complained, pulling a face. \u201cAnd what does he mean your fags got him through his NEWTs?\u201d\n\u201cHe must have confused me with someone,\u201d Remus shrugged. Sirius burst into hysterical giggling.\nThe next band, in Remus\u2019s opinion, was the best - they were called\nDragonhide\nand played a lot of Slade, Status Quo and Black Sabbath. It made Remus want to get up and dance, but her wasn\u2019t as drunk as Sirius or Peter, and had not completely lost his inhibitions. He couldn\u2019t help singing along towards the end, though - as almost everyone in the pub was, by this point. It seemed somehow like such a good idea to get up on his chair, waving his glass above his head as the whole pub roared;\n\n\u201cSo cum on feel the noize!\n\n\nGirls grab ya boys!\n\n\nWe get wild, wild, wild!\n\n\nWe get wild, wild, wild!\u201d\n\nSirius of course thought this was great fun, and after two attempts to climb up onto his own stool (quickly caught by James, who was in better command of his faculties), ended up with his arms slung around Peter and James, swinging this way and that, singing at the top of his voice;\n\n\u201cSo you think we have a lazy time, well you should know better...\n\n\nAnd I don't know whyyyyy\n\n\nI just don't know whyyyyy\n\n\nAnd you say I got a dirty mind, well I'm a mean go getter!\n\n\nAnd I don't know whyyyy\n\n\nAnd I don't know whyyyyyyy\n\n\nAnymore! Oh no--ooooh!\u201d\n\nIn fact, the marauders were all so taken by this hook that they were still singing it as loudly as they could as they staggered back through Hogsmeade to the high street, arm in arm, tripping and laughing as they went. Out in the cold air, Remus felt a bit sharper, and slightly guilty as he realised what a state Sirius and Peter were in.\nBy the time they got to Honeyduke\u2019s, it must have been well past midnight. The snuck inside as quietly as possible and headed for the cellar - James and Remus desperately trying to herd Sirius and Peter away from all of the sweets on display. The walk back through the tunnel to Hogwarts was pretty dreadful. Peter could barely keep his eyes open and staggered against James, complaining he had a headache. Sirius bounced from wall to wall, seemingly only held upright by his own forward momentum, occasionally bursting into snatches of song.\nAt end of the tunnel, James and Remus were very much sober, Peter was barely conscious, and Sirius was looking worryingly green.\n\u201cMerlin, how are we going to get them back to bed without waking up the whole castle?!\u201d James huffed, still supporting Peter. Sirius promptly leaned over and threw up.\n\u201cChrist,\u201d Remus grabbed his shoulders, as he was in danger of toppling forward into the pool of sick. He pulled Sirius\u2019s hair back, quickly, and patted his friend on the back. \u201cErrr\u2026\u201d he looked at James, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take Peter with the cloak, it\u2019ll be easier. I\u2019ll wait a bit with him,\u201d he jerked his head at Sirius, \u201cThen summon the cloak in half an hour or so? Easier with two, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cGood plan.\u201d James said, gratefully. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want me to watch him?\u201d\nSirius sat down on the ground, very suddenly, head in his hands and groaning.\n\u201cNah, I\u2019ve looked after pissheads before,\u201d Remus smirked. \u201cYou go. Cheers for the birthday, James, it was bloody brilliant.\u201d\nJames flashed him a smile before disappearing under the invisibility cloak with Peter still clinging on for dear life. Remus sighed and sat himself down next to Sirius. He pointed his wand at the mess opposite,\n\u201c\nScourgify\n.\u201d And it was clean.\nSirius groaned again, and rested his head on Remus\u2019s shoulder. Remus chuckled, softly, \u201cAlright there, mate?\u201d\n\u201cUrgh.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sounds about right. Hey, don\u2019t puke on me, ok?\u201d\n\u201cMmmph.\u201d\n\u201cThirsty?\u201d\n\u201cYuh.\u201d\nRemus drank the last of his bottle of firewhisky, then touched his wand to the opening,\n\u201c\nAguamente\n!\u201d and it filled with crystal clear cold water. He handed it to Sirius, \u201cDon\u2019t drink it too fast, or you will puke.\u201d\n\u201cMmm.\u201d Sirius sipped it a bit, eyes still closed. His face was a bit pale and clammy, but he still looked ten times better than Remus probably did. \u201cYou\u2019re so good at stuff, Moony.\u201d He slurred, leaning heavily on Remus\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus grunted, \u201cPicking locks and holding my drink.\u201d\n\u201cAnd magic.\u201d Sirius murmured, sleepily.\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re wizards, idiot.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m good at magic,\u201d Sirius sighed, \u201cBut you, like\u2026\nare\n, magic, y\u2019know?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re drunk and talking bollocks.\u201d Remus laughed. \u201cOi, don\u2019t fall asleep, I\u2019ve got to get you back.\u201d\n\u201cShuddup.\u201d Sirius replied, nodding off.\nRemus sighed, and wondered if anyone would notice if they just stayed put."

            "content": "Saturday 26\nth\nApril 1975\n\u201cRemus Lupin, put that book down at once!\u201d Madam Pomfrey\u2019s shrill, tired voice echoed across the infirmary floor. Remus dropped the heavy textbook, looking up, startled.\n\u201cCan you see through the screen?!\u201d He called back. He had thought he was practically alone.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she replied, \u201cI just know you too well.\u201d She appeared, stepping around the pale green hospital screens. It was lighter, beyond them \u2013 Pomfrey had cast a spell which created a capsule of darkness around Remus\u2019s bed. So that he could get some sleep, she said.\nShe snatched the book up, now, giving him a stern look. \u201cI had hoped you\u2019d be resting your eyes, not straining them.\u201d\n\u201cI can see in the dark,\u201d he shrugged. It was true \u2013 no matter how much punishment his body took, his eyes remained perfect, better than perfect, even.\n\u201cNo excuse.\u201d Madam Pomfrey tutted. \u201cAs you\u2019re up, I suppose you\u2019re ready for visitors?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, of course!\u201d He sat up, eagerly, straightening his night shirt.\n\u201cCome on, then,\u201d she called to James, Sirius and Peter, who appeared single-file from behind the screen. \u201cNot too much noise, and no books!\u201d\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you have books?\u201d James asked, leaning over the end of the bed frame.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s\nMoony\n,\u201d Sirius said, flinging himself bodily across the small single bed, right over Remus\u2019s legs. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand moderation.\u201d\n\u201cI just want to revise,\u201d Remus sighed, rubbing the back of his head, \u201cI mean, I\u2019m\nat school\n, it\u2019s what I\u2019m\nsupposed\nto do.\u201d He accepted a chocolate frog from Peter, who was handing them out.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to burn out though,\u201d Sirius said, his own mouth full of chocolate, \u201cYou\u2019re miles ahead of the rest of the class, and exams aren\u2019t for ages.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re two weeks away,\u201d James said, nibbling at his own piece of chocolate, surprisingly daintily. \u201cYou could do with being a bit better prepared, Black.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\nam\nsorry,\u201d Sirius rolled his blue eyes dramatically, rolling onto his back. Remus winced. \u201cI forgot you\u2019d joined the swot club too.\u201d\n\u201cOne afternoon in the library does not make me a swot!\u201d James frowned, clearly deeply offended.\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, James,\u201d Remus grinned, \u201c\nI\u2019m\nproud of you. Thanks for the frogs, Pete.\u201d\n\u201cOh, they\u2019re not from me,\u201d Peter said, settling into the armchair beside the bed, \u201cDezzie says she hopes you get well soon.\u201d\nRemus, Peter and James all turned their heads at once.\n\u201cDezzie.\u201d Sirius said, sitting up. \u201cYou mean Desdemona?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 yeah?\u201d Peter stopped chomping chocolate and started looking nervous. \u201cShe asked me why I couldn\u2019t see her today, so I told her I was seeing Moony. What?!\u201d He looked from James to Sirius, \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything about why he was sick, I just said\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou idiot!\u201d Sirius jumped down from the bed.\n\u201cSirius!\u201d Remus hissed \u2013 if they were too loud Madam Pomfrey would chase them out, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Really.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fine!\u201d Sirius seethed, he was standing over Peter now, \u201cYou can\u2019t go telling everyone Remus is in the hospital wing! Not everyone is as slow on the uptake as you! Doesn\u2019t the word \u2018secret\u2019 mean anything to you?!\u201d\n\u201cYou\nknow\nit does,\u201d Peter said, jutting out his chin, his lower lip trembling, \u201cI\u2019ve kept all sorts of\u2026\u201d he glanced furtively at Remus, then changed tact, \u201cAnyway, Dezzie\u2019s not everyone, she\u2019s my\ngirlfriend\n.\u201d\n\u201cSo what?!\u201d Sirius raged, \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell every tart that lets you stick your slimy tongue down her throat?!\u201d\nPeter\u2019s eyes filled with furious tears. He sniffed, hard, and rubbed his nose, standing up.\n\u201cJust because I\u2019ve got a girlfriend! Just because\u2026 because some of us actually\nlike\nspending time with girls!\u201d\nSirius\u2019s face seemed to transform into a new, terrible kind of rage that Remus had never seen before. His heart was pounding a mile a minute, Remus could hear it clear as a bell.\n\u201cWhat are you trying to say, Pettigrew?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019d rather be with Dezzie than you lot, right now. Sorry, Remus.\u201d Peter said, very quickly, before departing, storming out of the ward with a newly confident stride.\nThere was a steely silence, and Remus found he couldn\u2019t bring himself to look at Sirius \u2013 whatever emotion he was working through seemed like something which ought to be private, He looked at James instead, still standing at the foot of the bed, chewing his lip. He met Remus\u2019s eye, and gave him a reassuring smile.\n\u201cMoody pair of buggers, eh?\u201d He broke the tension, \u201cAnyway, how are you feeling? Moon go ok?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, no scars,\u201d Remus nodded, slowly, aware of Sirius\u2019s heart still beating loudly at his shoulder. \u201cNothing broken, either. Maybe I\u2019m finally getting good at being a werewolf.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did he mean?\u201d Sirius said, suddenly, turning to look at James.\n\u201cI dunno, mate,\u201d Potter shrugged, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, he gave as good as he got; you\u2019re just miffed because he finally stuck up for himself.\u201d\n\u201cHe meant\nsomething\n.\u201d Sirius muttered.\n\u201cHow\u2019s quidditch going?\u201d Remus asked, quickly, \u201cReady for the final?\u201d\nJames\u2019s brow smoothed instantly, and he straightened up, eager to tell Remus all about his big plans for the upcoming Ravenclaw game. The Slytherin/Gryffindor rematch had taken place in late March, and much to everyone\u2019s surprise, Regulus Black had resumed his role as seeker. James had quietly told Remus afterwards that Regulus had threatened half of the Slytherins with painful disfigurement charms if word got back to Walpurga that he was back on the team.\nGryffindor had won by only five points, which was lucky, because Remus couldn\u2019t imagine Sirius being in a worse mood than he already was. Things had not been good.\nFor his part, Remus had been trying to be extra kind to Sirius ever since February. Though Remus had always known that the Blacks were far from an ideal, nurturing family unit, he had always sort of assumed that it couldn\u2019t be\nthat\nbad. After all, in his experience, adults were there to maintain order, to instruct, and to punish. James had had an extremely cushy time of it, as far as Remus was concerned, so it had made sense that he was sympathetic towards Sirius.\nPerhaps it was maturity, or perhaps it was having seen bright, vivacious Sirius brought low by his own mother, but Remus was finally beginning to understand that whatever went on in the noble and ancient house of Black was not normal. In fact, it was entirely unacceptable. The fact that Sirius had survived under such oppression for so long without turning into Snape or just cracking under the weight of it was remarkable. Remus knew how hard it was to push against other people\u2019s expectations \u2013 against your own nature, sometimes.\nIt was starting to show, though. Maybe since Remus\u2019s birthday \u2013 after Sirius had got himself so horrendously drunk and they had holed up together in that cold tunnel. Though, that might just have been when Remus first noticed it \u2013 it could well have started after Regulus\u2019s fall. But there had been a definite shift. Sirius was tired \u2013 worn out, like Remus felt after a moon. Some of the fight had left him; that much was clear. He still got angry, but it came in short bursts, and he would quickly sink into a dark and quiet mood.\nThe late night conversations with James had resumed, too. Remus was not invited. He didn\u2019t exactly expect to be, but he had thought they\u2019d got a bit closer that year, and that maybe Sirius would choose to confide in\nboth\nof them. But the only thing Sirius seemed to want from Remus these days was cigarettes \u2013 if Remus had the heart to charge him, he might have made a fortune; Sirius was rarely without a fag behind his ear, or between his lips.\n\u201cTeenage mood swings.\u201d Lily had said, decisively, when Marlene mentioned that Sirius seemed out of sorts, \u201cHonestly,\u201d the redhead sighed, tossing her hair, \u201cHe acts like everything that happens to him is some great drama, but he\u2019s no different than the rest of us. Hormones.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Mary, frowned, \u201cHis family\nis\na bit of a nightmare\u2026 dark wizards, and that. Can\u2019t be easy, with everything that\u2019s going on in the papers.\u201d\n\u201cSirius isn\u2019t a dark wizard.\u201d Remus said, immediately,\n\u201cI know that.\u201d Mary snapped, \u201cI just meant that he might be feeling a bit torn, that\u2019s all.\u201d She had been snapping at Remus a lot, since Snape\u2019s\nVeritaserum\n\u2018prank\u2019. Even though Remus had apologised profusely, and many times, he couldn\u2019t deny that the things he\u2019d said had been the truth.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said again, ducking his head. \u201cYou\u2019re right. He hasn\u2019t got it easy.\u201d\n\u201cYou of all people shouldn\u2019t pity him, Remus.\u201d Lily huffed, slamming down an entirely new pile of revision books.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s had every advantage over you and still can\u2019t be a nice person,\u201d she said, dividing the books up between the four of them. \u201cHe\u2019s ridiculously wealthy, pureblood, old magic, privately educated, has both of his parents \u2013 ugh, he and Potter are so--\u201d\n\u201cJames and Sirius are not that alike.\u201d Was the only response Remus had.\nIt seemed like everyone was in a bad mood.\nIn the hospital wing, James had finally run out of things to say about the Ravenclaw match, which was scheduled for early May, just before exams started. He seemed to have noticed that Remus had tuned out, and had fallen silent. Sirius was bored too, and had started trying to transfigure various items around the bed \u2013 a lamp, an unused bedpan, the empty vase on the night stand.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Remus said, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit boring for you two here. You don\u2019t have to stay.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d James waved a hand, carelessly, \u201cNothing else to do around here \u2013 Ravenclaw have booked the pitch for the rest of the day. And Sirius won\u2019t come to the library with me, so\u2026\u201d\nPotter had started putting extra effort into his studies that year for the first time, much to Sirius\u2019s disappointment. At first, Remus had thought it was another ploy to get close to Lily, but James never asked to be involved in their study group, and actually appeared to prefer working alone. He told them that his parents had threatened to take his broom away for the summer if his results weren\u2019t better than last year \u2013 but Sirius had whispered to Remus afterwards that actually, McGonagall had warned him that if he didn\u2019t pull his socks up he wouldn\u2019t get a chance at being quidditch captain.\n\u201cYou can quiz me, if you want.\u201d Remus said, cheering up a bit. \u201cAsk me stuff about Potions, then I\u2019ll do whichever subject you want.\u201d\n\u201cHistory,\u201d James sighed, \u201cI am crap at History\u2026\u201d\n\u201cUgh, well if you\u2019re going to do that, I\u2019ll go.\u201d Sirius said, hauling himself up. \u201cI\u2019m crap at all of it.\u201d\n\u201cNo you\u2019re not, don\u2019t be stupid\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m off,\u201d Sirius shook his head, distracted. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go and find some girls to hang around with, since that\u2019s so important to everyone.\u201d\n\u201cSince when has stuff Peter says bothered you?!\u201d Remus frowned. But it was too late, Sirius was already leaving.\nRemus looked at James. James ran a hand through his hair.\n\u201cSorry, Moony, just ignore him. It\u2019s not you \u2013 or Peter, come to that, it\u2019s\u2026 he got an owl from home this morning.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right\u2026\u201d Remus looked down. He should have realised.\n\u201cYeah, they\u2019ve told him he\u2019s got to go home for the whole summer this year \u2013 learn his family duty once and for all, or some rubbish He says he\u2019s going to be really bored, but\u2026 I dunno, I think he\u2019s scared, to be honest. Everyone says they\u2019re in pretty deep with\nyou know who\n.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be ok, though, won\u2019t he?\u201d Remus fiddled with the corner of his bedsheet anxiously, \u201cThey can\u2019t force him to marry anyone again, and he\u2019s not of age yet, so he can\u2019t join up, or whatever.\u201d\nJames shrugged. He looked very tired too.\n\u201cI dunno, mate,\u201d he said, softly. \u201cI dunno what they want. Anyway, I\u2019m not going anywhere. Let\u2019s start with Potions, shall we?\u201d"

            "content": "Thursday 29\nth\nMay 1975\nThe exam period seemed to fly by, that year. Remus really felt as though he\u2019d got into the swing of things for the first time, and \u2013 though he didn\u2019t like to rest on his laurels \u2013 was relatively certain he had achieved decent marks all round. Even Potions had been less stressful than usual, thanks to Lily\u2019s careful guidance and patient coaching throughout the year.\nIn fact, by the third week of May, Remus found himself at something of a loose end. He had completed all of his tests, but none of his friends had \u2013 between Muggle Studies and Divination, the marauders and the girls were still cloistered away studying or in the exam hall. But he was far from lonely. Remus spent his free time taking leisurely walks in the grounds, reading whatever and whenever he felt like, and putting the finishing touches to his greatest accomplishment; the marauder\u2019s map.\nIt had been almost four full years in the making, but Remus\u2019s original rudimentary map of Hogwarts had expanded and developed until it presented a comprehensive view of the entire castle \u2013 secret entrances, tunnels and hidden chambers included. With the marauder\u2019s help, it now moved and shifted in time with the rhythm of the building itself, located and identified every being present in the castle, and it worked beautifully. Remus had never been more proud of anything in his life \u2013 indeed, he had never created anything worth being proud of.\nIt still needed some kind of locking spell \u2013 at present he was able to have the ink disappear and reappear with a quick disillusionment charm, but this was not enough, not if it was to leave their dorm room. That would be something to research over the summer; he had already spoken to Madam Pince about borrowing a few books, with the understanding that he would reimburse her in full for any damage, should it occur.\nRemus was looking forward to the summer perhaps even less than usual. Now that he was fully aware of the political climate in the wizarding world, he found the thought of stepping outside of it for two months very disconcerting. Who knew what could happen in the meantime \u2013 say nothing of the danger his friends might find themselves in. For the first summer since 1972, the marauders would be completely separated. Sirius had been forbidden from seeing the Potters, Remus would be at St Edmund\u2019s as usual \u2018for his own safety\u2019 and the Pettigrews were going to America to visit Philomena \u2013 Peter suspected to try and bring her home.\nSirius\u2019s situation was the most concerning. James had tried everything; even writing to Dumbledore, but no one was willing or able to override the Black family\u2019s wishes. Even Sirius had resigned himself somewhat to his fate.\n\u201cI\u2019ll have Reg,\u201d he sighed, heavily, \u201cMaybe if he\u2019s not surrounded by Slytherins all the time he\u2019ll listen to a bit of reason \u2013 he\u2019s old enough, now.\u201d\nRemus had promised to write; every day if Sirius wanted him to. Even Mary had offered to try and visit, as she lived in London too. Of course, she was muggleborn and it was entirely out of the question.\nJames actually had an escape plan ready to enact the moment Sirius gave the word \u2013 it involved a complex chain of communication, his broom, and breaking at least ten wizarding laws, but they were all ready to do it. Even Peter, who had forgiven Sirius his outburst in April and been forgiven in turn.\nRemus had thought about how to spend his own summer, and had already decided he would not be repeating the events of last year. Not that he would turn down the chance to \u2018earn\u2019 a bit of cash if it came his way \u2013 his plans to hunt down Greyback had not altered, and would still need financing \u2013 but he also needed to stay focussed. Staying out all night drinking and fighting was not productive, nor did it solve any of his problems. He also knew that he needed to keep a low profile for as long as possible, and getting himself arrested for petty crime was not a clever move.\nHaving spent a fair bit of time indoors lately completing the map, and the weather being neither too hot nor too cold for May, Remus decided to venture out onto the grounds to read. He had finally read all of the muggle books Sirius had brought with him to Hogwarts in their first year, and was now borrowing from Lily. She was a big Jane Austen fan \u2013 which was a shame, as Remus wasn\u2019t, but he was making do with\nEmma\nall the same.\nHe sat under the dappled shade of a big beech tree, by the lake, with his back to the whomping willow. As he\u2019d feared, Remus soon grew bored of Miss Woodhouse\u2019s dreadful prattling \u2013 it turned out the stupid book was all about matchmaking and he\u2019d had plenty of that already this year, thank you very much. He put the book down and leaned against the trunk, looking up at the brilliant green leaves, his eyelids slowly sighing shut.\nHe had a very strange dream. (Though, Remus would think to himself much later, all dreams were pretty odd, weren\u2019t they?) He couldn\u2019t remember exactly what was going on in the dream, or where he was or who was with him. But there was perhaps another person \u2013 another body, at least, very close to his own. It was an intensely physical sensation, similar to his memories of being the wolf, but undoubtedly more pleasant. The way this other body fitted against his was deeply soothing, warm and satisfying in a way he had never felt before.\nRemus wasn\u2019t sure how long he\u2019d slept for, but when he awoke there was chatter all around him. One of the exams had obviously finished and students were pouring out onto the grounds, exalting in their hard won freedom. Remus blinked against the bright summer sunlight and straightened up, a bit embarrassed to have dozed off \u2013 not to mention the physical reaction the weird dream had prompted. He quickly rearranged his robes, looking about to check no one had noticed.\nHis back was stiff and sore now, from leaning against the trunk. His mouth was dry, and his left foot had gone numb. He stretched and shook it out, wincing as pins and needles shot up his leg.\n\u201cWotcher, Remus!\u201d A gruff, liverpudlian accent came from behind him, \u201cNot sleeping, were you?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d He said at once, as Ferox came into view.\nRemus grabbed up\nEmma\nand tried to pretend he had only put it down for a moment. Ferox smiled at him knowingly, but didn\u2019t make fun. He set down a heavy bucket of something slimy which smelled foul.\n\u201cCame to say goodbye to the squid.\u201d He nodded at the lake which was as still as a millpond.\n\u201cAre you going away for the summer, professor?\u201d Remus asked, mildly interested as he rubbed his leg to get the blood flowing again.\n\u201cMm.\u201d Ferox nodded, squinting out at the lake, \u201cThe summer and\u2026 maybe longer. \u2018Fraid I won\u2019t see you in September.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Remus blinked, startled, \u201cBut\u2026 who\u2019ll teach us Care of Magical Creatures?\u201d\n\u201cProfessor Kettleburn\u2019ll be back. I was only ever filling in for him.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Remus had sort of known that all along, but it still came as a shock. He felt horribly sad, he\u2019d never had to say goodbye to anyone he knew he\u2019d miss before. He had a strong urge to tell Ferox this; to tell him how much he wished he would stay, but the words wouldn\u2019t come. \u201cS\u2019a pity.\u201d Was all he could muster.\nHe stood up, shakily, legs still sore. Ferox dipped a hand into the bucket of slimy silvery things and withdrew something long and wriggly. He flung it into the lake, and two tentacles broke the water\u2019s surface to catch it. Ferox smiled.\n\u201cI won\u2019t lie, I\u2019ll miss this place.\u201d He said, reaching in for another one. Squelch. He glanced at Remus, \u201cAnd my best class, of course.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s my favourite subject!\u201d Remus said, all in a hot rush.\n\u201cI should think so!\u201d Ferox grinned, throwing another slithery thing. Splash. \u201cI\u2019m not s\u2019posed to tell you your results until August, but... well, I\u2019m bloody proud of you, Lupin. Top marks, best in the year. Better than plenty of my OWL students.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good teacher,\u201d Remus said, sadly.\n\u201cSo\u2019s Kettleburn.\u201d Ferox reassured him, still feeding the squid. Squelch. Splash.\n\u201cWhere are you going? Back to the ministry?\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026 no.\u201d Ferox\u2019s expression changed. He didn\u2019t frown, exactly, but his features darkened, the smile faded. \u201cI\u2019ve some business for Dumbledore. Not sure the ministry would\u2026 anyway, it\u2019s not for you to worry about.\u201d He shook his head, then smiled again looking down at Remus. \u201cI\u2019ll be abroad for a while.\u201d\nSquelch. Splash.\nRemus wondered if he would ever see Professor Ferox again. He still wasn\u2019t quite sure how big the wizarding community really was, but he didn\u2019t think it could be very large, not if there was only one school in Britain. Would it be ok to write to Ferox? Or was that inappropriate? He wouldn\u2019t write to someone like McGonagall, for example, or Professor Slughorn.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be asking Kettleburn for updates, y\u2019know.\u201d Ferox said, reading his mind, \u201cSo don\u2019t think you can start slacking. Us dead-end oiks have to show the rest of the posh nobs how it\u2019s done, eh? Now more than ever.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t slack off,\u201d Remus said, fiercely, \u201cI promise.\u201d\nFerox laughed and nudged Remus with an elbow,\n\u201cGood lad. Your dad\u2019d be proud.\u201d\n* * *\nFriday 27\nth\nJune 1975\nIt was the last Friday of term, all of the exams and lessons were finished for another year, and Remus had made a mental list of all of the packing he needed to do. This year he and James had conspired together to ensure that all of Sirius\u2019s got done in time \u2013 James was gradually warming to the idea of letting Remus help when it came to Sirius\u2019s welfare. They planned that on Saturday morning James and Peter would take him out for a few hour\u2019s flying, while Remus would sort through everything. He\u2019d promised he didn\u2019t mind; anything that might help.\nThey were all sitting around at dinner \u2013nothing special, just fish pie, the feast wouldn\u2019t be until Sunday night \u2013 when the owls began to fly in for last post.\n\u201cUgh.\u201d Sirius groaned as a large brown eagle owl landed in front of him. One of the Black family owls.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d James jumped in quickly, tugging the small scroll wrapped around the bird\u2019s scaly leg. He pushed his round glasses back on his nose, and his eyes darted quickly across the paper. Then he shrugged and scrunched it up, tossing it over his shoulder. \u201cJust making sure you know you have to meet them at King\u2019s Cross, they\u2019re expecting you and Regulus to be together.\u201d\n\u201cWorried I\u2019ll pull another disappearing act.\u201d Sirius smirked.\n\u201cEr\u2026 will you?\u201d Peter asked, nervously.\n\u201cNot worth it.\u201d Sirius sighed, \u201cBet they\u2019ll be there early just to spite me. I\u2019ll have to come up with another way to piss them off.\u201d\n\u201cOr you could just try to keep your head down and make it through the summer.\u201d Remus suggested, lightly, finishing his ice cream.\nSirius just raised an eyebrow at him. Remus poked his tongue out. They both knew that was pretty much impossible, even if Sirius tried his very best.\nThey didn\u2019t have long to feel sorry for Sirius, however \u2013 Mary, who had also received some post, let out a shriek, then burst into tears. The owl in front of her hopped back, alarmed, then gave an offended \u2018hoot\u2019 and flapped away to the owlery.\n\u201cMary!\u201d Lily and Marlene both said at once, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nMary shook her head, apparently speechless, then covered her mouth and fled the dining hall. Lily and Marlene glanced at each other, then jumped up immediately to follow her.\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you think\u2019s up with her?\u201d Peter asked.\nRemus shrugged.\n\u201cGirl stuff.\u201d\nThey did not find out until later that evening. Mary was not in the common room, but Lily came down looking for a stray cardigan she had left somewhere.\n\u201cDarren dumped her,\u201d she said gravely to Remus, \u201cShe\u2019s a complete wreck, poor thing.\u201d\n\u201cRight before the holidays?\u201d Remus said, shocked, \u201cBit harsh!\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Lily replied, sadly, \u201cSaid he couldn\u2019t be bothered waiting around for her while she\u2019s at school all year \u2013 wants a girlfriend closer to home. I think she\u2019s well shot of him, he sounds horrible.\u201d\n\u201cBet Marlene\u2019s happy, though,\u201d Remus grinned, \u201cWon\u2019t have to hear about it anymore.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t bet on it,\u201d Lily\u2019s face was grim, \u201cShe hasn\u2019t shut up about how much she loved him yet\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPoor thing.\u201d Remus dig around in his pocket and withdrew his last sugar quill, \u201cGive her this, tell her I hope she feels better, eh?\u201d\n\u201cAhh, you\u2019re so sweet, Remus,\u201d Lily kissed him on the cheek, then headed upstairs again.\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t that upset when she broke up with\nme\n,\u201d Sirius muttered indignantly, moving a chess piece.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Remus shrugged, settling back down to the game, \u201cShe dumped you, didn\u2019t she. I expect it\u2019s different when you\u2019re the one getting dumped.\u201d\n\u201c\nI\nwasn\u2019t that upset.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you and Mary were that serious,\u201d James yawned, playing exploding snap on the rug with Peter. \u201cYou were only thirteen.\u201d\n\u201cFourteen.\u201d Sirius corrected. \u201cBut I take your point. Didn\u2019t really give it a fair go, did we?\u201d\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t very mature about it,\u201d Peter murmured, thumbing through his cards.\n\u201cNo, well no one ever caught us snogging in broom cupboards, you\u2019re right,\u201d Sirius snapped.\n\u201cJealousy doesn\u2019t suit you, Black,\u201d Peter replied, dryly.\n\u201cOi, you all promised me the snogging thing was over.\u201d Remus said, pointedly, giving them all a dark look.\n\u201cDon\u2019t knock it \u2018til you\u2019ve tried it, Moony,\u201d Peter grinned."

            "content": "Saturday 28\nth\nJune 1975\n\u201cHiya, Remus!\u201d Lily startled him as he was leaving the hospital wing. He\u2019d just had his final check up with Madam Pomfrey before school ended.\n\u201cHello.\u201d He said, nervously, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cDropping these off for Professor Slughorn,\u201d she raised a large jar of something that looked like purple frogspawn, \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing healing potions in Slug Club this term. Wait here, I\u2019ll walk back with you.\u201d\nShe disappeared inside the infirmary and he waited, trying not to look too suspicious. He hated being seen near the hospital. Lily finally came out with a breezy smile,\n\u201cThanks! What were you doing in there?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing, I um\u2026 a hex that went wrong.\u201d\n\u201cOh gosh, what happened?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 I\u2019d rather not say.\u201d He raised an eyebrow suggestively, hoping that she would get the picture. Fortunately, her mind went elsewhere,\n\u201cWas it Potter again? Ugh, he hexed Sev last week with something that made his neck swell up like a life ring!\u201d\n\u201cHuh, yeah, James is good at engorgement charms,\u201d Remus grinned.\n\u201cWell I wouldn\u2019t have thought he\u2019d hex the people who are supposedly his friends,\u201d Lily replied, primly.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t him!\u201d Remus replied, annoyed. He was keen not to badmouth James in front of Lily, after the mix up back in January.\n\u201cBlack, then.\u201d Lily shrugged, \u201cHe\u2019s just as bad. No idea why everyone fancies him.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026 Big plans for the summer?\u201d Lily changed tact, perhaps realising that Remus didn\u2019t particularly enjoy her tirades on the other marauders.\n\u201cNah,\u201d Remus shook his head, \u201cUsual stuff, probably. Homework. You?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to visit Marlene in July, we\u2019re trying to get Mary to come.\u201d\n\u201cHow is she?\u201d\nMary had been absent from every meal since the big break up, and had barely left the girls dorm as far as Remus could tell.\n\u201cBetter,\u201d Lily nodded, sadly, \u201cShe can go a few hours without crying, anyway. Keeps playing depressing Dusty Springfield albums, though.\u201d\nThey reached the portrait of the fat lady and bumped into Peter \u2013 and Desdemona Lewis, of course. They were in a tight embrace, arms wrapped around each other, murmuring between kisses;\n\u201cI\u2019ll miss you!\u201d She sighed,\n\u201cI\u2019ll miss you more!\u201d Peter said.\n\u201cWill you write?\u201d\n\u201cEvery day!\u201d\nRemus made loud retching noises, which made Lily giggle, but earned a furious frown from Peter. They quickly climbed through the portrait and left the lovebirds to it.\nGryffindor tower was complete anarchy when they reached it \u2013 as was usual on the last day of term. Students crawled under tables looking for lost things, ran around collecting up cards and game pieces, shouts of \u2018\naccio left trainer\n!\u2019 or \u2018\nAccio wristwatch\n!\u2019 rang out as everyone scrambled to pack at the very last minute. Remus couldn\u2019t help but wonder whether every common room was undergoing the same pandemonium \u2013 surely the organised Ravenclaws were in a much better state.\nSirius and James were not doing much to help the process \u2013 they were covertly levitating various items from behind one of the large armchairs, snickering to each other happily. Remus smiled, thinking again how much he would miss everything.\n\u201cYou two!\u201d Lily scolded them, marching over, holding her own wand up.\nSirius laughed and ducked behind James,\n\u201cCome on, Evans, just a bit of last day high spirits!\u201d\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just leave people be, Black?!\u201d\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you leave\nus\nbe,\u201d he retorted, firing green sparks at the ceiling from behind James\u2019s back, \u201cYou\u2019re not a prefect yet, y\u2019know!\u201d\n\u201cOooh, just wait \u2018til I am!\u201d She said, trying to throw a jinx at Sirius. It hit James instead, and turnips immediately sprung from his ears, the shocked expression on his face so comical that Remus collapsed into giggles.\n\u201cWell\nthat\nwasn\u2019t very goody-goody,\u201d Sirius laughed, transfiguring a nearby lamp into a flock of birds which fluttered screeching around the room, adding to the chaos.\nLily\u2019s next move was to shoot a jelly-legs jinx at James, causing him to fall to the floor in a heap, still clutching his turnip ears. With him out of the way and Sirius exposed, Lily disabled him with a binding spell, then turned to Remus.\n\u201cHelp me sort all this out, will you?\u201d\n\u201cAww\u2026 ok, fine,\u201d Remus sighed, still wiping tears of laughter away from his eyes. Together they managed to restore the common room to order, de-transfigure the lamp, repair the singe marks on the ceiling and calm down a wailing first year who had lost her cat. Lily left Remus to handle James and Sirius, who were in a real state now.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t she marvellous,\u201d James grinned dopily, as Remus tried to help him into a nearby chair, his legs still unsteady, folding underneath him.\n\u201cYeah, a real charmer,\u201d Sirius grumbled, struggling to get free from his body-bind.\n\u201cYou two are just lucky she only uses her power for good,\u201d Remus chastened them, \u201cYou\u2019d be no match for her if she decided to start really breaking the rules.\nFinite\n.\u201d He pointed his wand at Sirius, who was finally released. He rubbed his arms fiercely,\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe you helped her, Moony!\u201d\n\u201cOf course I did,\u201d Remus shrugged, \u201cI\u2019m terrified of her.\u201d\n* * *\nSunday 29\nth\nJune 1975\n\u201cOi, you two! We\u2019ll miss the train!\u201d Remus huffed, climbing the stairs to their dorm for what felt like the hundredth time that morning.\nTheir trunks had already been transported down to Hogsmeade station by some magical mechanism, and McGonagall had given the ten minute warning, but James and Sirius had vanished again.\nHe found them sitting on James\u2019s bed, which was stripped of bedclothes, heads bowed over something small Sirius was holding cupped carefully in his hands. The room felt horribly hollow and empty without all of the marauders things in it. The two black haired boys turned towards him as he entered, and Remus felt he had intruded on something very private. He hung back a moment, awkwardly.\n\u201cSorry, Moony,\u201d James smiled, climbing off the bed, \u201cWe\u2019re ready, eh Black?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, \u2018course,\u201d Sirius got up too. He had a dazed, distracted expression which made Remus ache on the inside. \u201cLook what James gave me,\u201d Sirius said, as he crossed the room. He held out something round and silver. Remus took it. It was warm from Sirius\u2019s hands. It was a compact mirror, beautifully etched with an ornate filigree style design.\n\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Remus turned it over, snapping it open, \u201cVery um\u2026 pretty?\u201d\nJames laughed,\n\u201cIt\u2019s magic \u2013 belonged to my grandad. Look,\u201d He opened his own, identical compact and looked into it. Remus looked down at Sirius\u2019s mirror, and was amazed to see James\u2019s bespectacled face grinning back at him. \u201cSo we can keep in touch over the summer.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d Remus exclaimed, \u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d James nodded, closing his compact and slipping it into his back pocket. \u201cWish I could have got them for all of us, but they\u2019re old family heirlooms and there\u2019s only two\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, of course,\u201d Remus handed the corresponding case back to Sirius. There was an awkward few seconds silence, before Remus cleared his throat, \u201cC\u2019mon, McGonagall\u2019s gonna hex us into next week if we miss the carriages.\u201d\nThey did make the carriages, and the train in time, and piled into their usual compartment.\nRemus was most disconcerted to find that this year their little carriage space was packed full of people. Not only the four marauders, but of course Desdemona was invited to join them \u2013 Remus had still not heard her say more than two words, possibly because her lips were so often occupied.\nMary joined them too, at Sirius\u2019s request. He had been paying her a good deal of attention over the past few days, and it was obvious she was rather enjoying it, having recently taken a heavy knock to her confidence. With Mary as always was Marlene, and finally Lily, who would have been forced to sit alone, otherwise.\nAs such, it was an incredibly noisy ride back to London. Between Sirius trying to impress Mary by singing every Beatles song he knew, James switching between trying to attract Lily\u2019s attention and talk quidditch tactics with Marlene, and Peter and Desdemona\u2019s fevered fumblings, Remus simply sat back against the window and enjoyed being among friends for what might be the last time in a very long time.\nHe tried not to think about the war, or who might go missing over the summer. He tried not to think about Sirius, alone and abused in a cold London mansion. He tried not to think about Ferox, off on dangerous missions for Dumbledore. He just watched his friends, their faces bright and animated, full of excitement and emotion.\nHe rubbed the back of his head, sleepily. His skinhead cut had grown out, and he had a pile of mousey brown curls now. He might not cut it again. He wouldn\u2019t let Matron do it, he decided; it was better longer. Softer. He didn\u2019t want to look hard and mean anymore, he didn\u2019t feel like he needed to. Smiling to himself, Remus drifted to sleep.\n* * *\n\n\n\nFourth year, epilogue: Some hours later\u2026\n\n\n\nRemus dragged his trunk from the bus, and down the long road to St Edmund\u2019s all by himself. It was the first year Matron hadn\u2019t met him at King\u2019s Cross \u2013 she\u2019d sent him his bus fare ahead of time and told him he was old enough now to make the journey alone. Perhaps she hoped he wouldn\u2019t come back at all. But where else would he go?\nHe entered the cold grey building with a sense of resignation, signed himself in at the front desk and made his way to his dorm. It was a bright, warm day, and he could hear most of the other boys shouting outside. He was hot and sticky, and hoping for a shower and a few quiet hours alone in which he could unpack and maybe get started on his summer reading. But as he entered the dorm room, he found he was not entirely alone.\nThere was a boy sitting on the bed adjacent to his. He must have been new; Remus didn\u2019t recognise him from last year. He looked about fifteen or sixteen, and wore a light blue vest top with orange piping and long flared denim jeans. His socks didn\u2019t match. His hair was blond and curly, his face sunny and snub nosed. He had a casual, friendly air.\n\u201cOh, hello.\u201d Remus said quietly, dragging his trunk over to his bed.\n\u201cOrright?\u201d The other boy greeted him. He had a chipped front tooth and a lopsided grin that made Remus want to smile back at him. His hair was long-ish and fell into his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re the kid wot goes to the fancy school all year, are ya? Name\u2019s Grant.\u201d\nRemus nodded, politely,\n\u201cRemus. Nice to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cBlimey,\u201d Grant cracked an even wider smile, \u201cThey said you was posh! Wan\u2019 me to bow to ya,\nm\u2019lord\n?\u201d\nRemus returned a soft smile, unable to help himself. The other boy wasn\u2019t being rude, or nasty. He forgot how much his accent had changed, after four years at Hogwarts.\n\u201cBig reader, are ya?\u201d Grant nodded at the books Remus was unpacking.\n\u201cI get a lot of homework.\u201d Remus said. Then he decided to relax a bit, \u201cAnd yeah, I like reading.\u201d\n\u201cCool.\u201d Grant replied. He lay back on the bed, arms behind his head, his long body stretched out, shirt rising up to expose the strip of skin just above his hips. Remus glanced at him sideways as he unpacked, trying not to look\ntoo\nmuch like he was looking. \u201cSo,\u201d Grant was saying, \u201cWhat sort of music d\u2019you like?\u201d"

            "content": "Selected letters between the marauders:\n\n\n\nDear Moony,\nI\u2019m pretty sure I can get away with writing letters at least for now. I imagine they\u2019re being read, but I DON\u2019T GIVE A SHIT, DO YOU HEAR ME, REGULUS??\nDreadful so far. Looks like Mum tried to take down my Gryffindor stuff while I was away, but I put it up with permanent sticking charms. I\u2019m going to see if there\u2019s anything else I can put up to piss her off.\nThere\u2019s a big family meeting next week, posh dinner, dress robes, best behaviour etc. etc. James thinks I should keep my head down and just make note of who attends and what gets said in case it\u2019s useful later. I don\u2019t know. Sort of want to set off some dungbombs instead. What would you do?\nSirius.\n* * *\nSirius,\nGetting on with Reg, then? Go easy on him, you don\u2019t have anyone else on your side.\nPlease be careful. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do, I\u2019ve never been to a posh dinner. Probably make a twat of myself. Don\u2019t do anything stupid, ok? James is usually right.\nRemus.\n* * *\nDear Remus,\nCan\u2019t believe I have to spend the whole summer without any of you. Sometimes I really hate being an only child. I bet you\u2019re never lonely, at St Edmund\u2019s.\nSirius seems ok, he checks in pretty often, I think he\u2019s bored. If boredom is the worst of it, then that\u2019s a good thing, right? I keep trying to convince him not to make a fuss \u2013 we don\u2019t know what sort of thing the Blacks are involved in. Could be nothing at all.\nHope your summer is off to a good start. Have you looked at the homework? That Charms essay looks like a right ball ache.\nJames.\n* * *\nJames,\nHe\u2019d be fine if he could control himself, but I doubt it. Keep talking to him, remind him he\u2019s got to get back to Hogwarts in one piece.\nSummer is fine. You\u2019re right, I don\u2019t ever get lonely. I wouldn\u2019t mind a bit of privacy most of the time, but this summer\u2019s been good. Don\u2019t worry about me.\nThat Charms essay is a doddle and you know it. You just don\u2019t like hard work, Potter.\nRemus.\n* * *\nMoony,\nGreetings from San Francisco! I thought it would be hot here, but it\u2019s bloody freezing and rains most of the time. Merlin knows why Philomena would want to live here, it\u2019s no different than dear old Blighty.\nPete.\n* * *\nDear Moony,\nCaused uproar this week, it was brilliant. Found a bunch of old muggle posters in a skip down the road \u2013 pictures of girls, you know the sort. They don\u2019t even move, it\u2019s hilarious. Anyway, stuck them up on the walls with my patented sticking charm, and mum IS FURIOUS.\nI think she\u2019s probably only annoyed because they\u2019re muggle girls, she couldn\u2019t care less that they\u2019ve got their tits out. Anyway, now I can\u2019t go out unsupervised. Worth it, though.\nSirius.\n* * *\nSirius,\nYou\u2019re an idiot and you know it. Posters??? Don\u2019t you feel weird with them all staring at you?\nRemus.\n* * *\nDear Remus,\nReally worried about Sirius. I don\u2019t know if he told you about the stunt he pulled with the posters, but he\u2019s a bloody idiot for doing it. Don\u2019t believe him if he says he\u2019s fine, he\u2019d definitely been crying when I spoke to him last with the mirror (don\u2019t tell him I told you that, obviously).\nStandby in case we need to trigger the rescue mission.\nJames.\n* * *\nJames,\nReady when you are.\nRemus.\n* * *\nMoony,\nDon\u2019t listen to Potter, he\u2019s an old woman. Everything\u2019s fine, nothing I can\u2019t cope with. Hope you\u2019re having a good summer. Can\u2019t wait for September.\nSirius.\n* * *\nFriday 22\nnd\nAugust 1975\nRemus staggered weakly into the dorm room. It had been a bad one. Madam Pomfrey thought it must be because of the change of scenery. He had a long thick scar across his chest, now \u2013 it had been ages since he\u2019d got a scar.\nGrant sat up abruptly, looking hurt.\n\u201cWhere you been?\u201d He asked, \u201cThought you\u2019d got arrested or summink.\u201d\n\u201cSick,\u201d Remus replied.\n\u201cSick wiv what?\u201d\nRemus sighed, flopping down on his bed. It had been a hard night, and he just wanted to sleep. He closed his eyes. He didn\u2019t feel like excuses today.\n\u201cWell, it was the full moon last night, you see.\u201d He said, calmly, \u201cWhen I was five I was bitten by a werewolf and now I am one. I turn every month, and Matron locks me up so I don\u2019t hurt anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\nha ha\n.\u201d Grant replied, climbing onto Remus\u2019 bed, straddling him. They were both so skinny they fit easily together on the narrow bunk. \u201cVery funny, clever clogs. Fine, don\u2019t tell me.\u201d\nHe leaned forward and kissed Remus.\nRemus opened his eyes, freezing for a moment. \u201cS\u2019fine,\u201d Grant assured him, stroking his cheek, \u201cThey\u2019re all outside, I checked.\u201d\nRemus kissed him back.\nIt had been a strange sort of summer, but one of the most pleasant Remus had ever had. He hadn\u2019t been lonely, for once; hadn\u2019t counted down the days until the first of September.\nIn the beginning, he and Grant had bonded over David Bowie, T-Rex and Neil Young \u2013 even Deep Purple, who Grant was crazy about and Remus thought Sirius would probably like. They both hated football \u2013 and the other boys \u2013 so they sloped off together around town, or sat behind the big empty portakabins smoking stolen packs of fags.\nThey had been sitting there on the hot gravel one day in mid-July, flicking stones and debating the finer points of\nElectric Warrior\n, when suddenly Grant\u2019s hand was on Remus\u2019 knee, then at his waist, pulling him closer.\n\u201cWhat are you-!?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Grant whispered, desperation edging his voice, pressing his forehead against Remus\u2019s hot cheek, \u201cNo one\u2019s gonna find out.\u201d He tasted like cigarettes and sunburn.\nAfter that, whenever they were alone together they were snogging.\nIt was sort of a surprise, but mostly not. Remus quickly realised that he had always wanted it \u2013 this, or something like it. Like a fog lifting. All things considered, he was grateful to Grant for having taken the initiative.\nIt wasn\u2019t what you could call romantic, or affectionate. More like a necessary thing. Something Remus knew that he had to push as far as it would go, so that he could identify all of the hard edges and sharp limits of it. He was mapping out his own desires, and using Grant as a compass.\nHis full name was Grant Chapman. He had just turned sixteen, and he\u2019d been at St. Edmund\u2019s since May, though it was by no means his first Home. Both of Grant\u2019s parents were living, and he even had some extended family \u2013 grandparents and aunts and uncles and grown-up cousins. But none of them seemed to want to keep him on for very long,\n\u201cToo much of a handful,\u201d Grant would grin, cheekily. \u201cEveryone gets sick of me in the end.\u201d\nLike most of the boys at St Edmund\u2019s, he did badly at school and had been in trouble with the police a few times on minor offences, though he\u2019d never been officially arrested. He wasn\u2019t violent, but he had a mouth on him and a tendency to talk back. But there wasn\u2019t a threatening bone in his body, he was so clearly good all over.\nHe had a spectacular smile; it creased his whole face and made you like him at once. One of his canine teeth was a bit wonky and it was nothing short of endearing. Remus couldn\u2019t see why no one wanted him around. He was a bit silly sometimes; a bit immature, but that was ok \u2013 Remus knew he could be too serious a lot of the time. Something about Grant\u2019s chirpy, happy-go-lucky nature made Remus more confident \u2013 comfortable. And Grant just\nliked\nRemus so much. Really liked him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the funniest bloke I ever met.\u201d Grant laughed, when Remus hadn\u2019t even said anything that amusing. \u201cMind you, never copped off with anyone from a\nprivate\nschool before.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m no different from you,\u201d Remus replied, \u201cA care home yob.\u201d\n\u201cPiss off,\u201d Grant shoved him, playfully, \u201cYou\u2019re going places, anyone can see that.\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t have a response to that, but it made him smile. Grant often made him smile.\nBesides all of these things, Grant was a really, really good kisser. At least, Remus assumed as much, considering that Grant was the only person he had ever kissed. The first time, he\u2019d felt a wild thrill as he thought to himself;\nso THIS is what all the fuss is about!\nHe could snog Grant all day long, without coming up for air. Sometimes he found himself compulsively pursing his lips in the night, hot with withdrawal pangs. Remus had expected kissing to be scary and awkward, but \u2013 as with so many things \u2013 Grant just put him ease. He made it\nfun\n, right from the beginning; no fuss, no questions.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re only here for the summer then we might as well enjoy it, eh?\u201d He would say, cheerfully, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I ain\u2019t exactly about to propose, sweet as you are.\u201d\n\u201cSweet!\u201d Remus scoffed.\n\u201cSweet,\u201d Grant winked, \u201cAnd too bloody good for me by half.\u201d\nRemus hated that kind of talk, and shut him up with another kiss.\nThey had to hide most of the time, of course. From the other boys, and from the staff. Remus couldn\u2019t imagine what would happen if they were found out \u2013 they\u2019d be separated, definitely, even if they weren\u2019t beaten to a pulp. Would Matron tell Dumbledore? Could they expel you, for being a\u2026 well, for kissing other boys? Fortunately, Grant had some experience in covert operations, and they never even came close to being disturbed.\n\u201cHow many times have you done this sort of thing?\u201d Remus got up the courage to ask, one day. They were behind some disused bike sheds at the local secondary school.\n\u201cFew times,\u201d Grant shrugged, \u201cNot enough. You?\u201d\n\u201cNever!\u201d Remus replied, shocked. \u201cI didn\u2019t even\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh bless ya,\u201d Grant laughed lightly, tugging one of Remus\u2019s curls, \u201cYou didn\u2019t know.\u201d\nRemus shook his head, his ears growing hot. Grant tutted, \u201cNever look at another bloke a bit too long? Never get that feeling about a film star, or a teacher?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Oh my god!\u201d Remus gasped, images of Ferox crashing down on him. Grant laughed again.\n\u201cAnd I thought you were all at it, you boarding school lads.\u201d\nRemus just shook his head again in disbelief, wondering if there was anything else he didn\u2019t know about himself.\nAs September approached Remus found himself trying to ignore it. He felt guilty for not having spent the summer worrying about the war, for being distracted by his own selfish urges, especially at a time like this. But at the same time, he felt that he might never have this opportunity again.\nThe other marauders sent letters, as they did every summer \u2013 Remus diligently wrote back, not wanting them to worry. He said nothing at all about Grant. He didn\u2019t know\nwhat\nto say, sure that if he put pen to paper it would all come spilling out, and the other boys would never speak to him again. Or worse; they\u2019d try to understand it, without looking him in the eye.\nThat was part of it. On the other hand, Remus just\nliked\nthe idea of keeping it to himself. The marauders didn\u2019t have to know\neverything\nabout him, and he was allowed to have other friends, wasn\u2019t he?"

He was glad Matron hadn\u2019t come with him this year. Glad to have had the time alone to prepare himself. Grant had wanted to come, but Matron said no, and wouldn\u2019t give him the fare anyway.\nThey\u2019d managed a quick goodbye locked inside a bathroom at St. Edmund\u2019s \u2013 one of their many hiding places. Neither of them had said any of the things they\u2019d wanted to say \u2013 actually, they\u2019d hardly spoken at all \u2013 but with minutes left, Remus promised he\u2019d try to write.\n\u201cI\u2019m crap at writing,\u201d Grant complained, \u201cCan\u2019t you give me the phone number?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 it\u2019s a really old fashioned school. We don\u2019t get to use the phone much.\u201d Remus blagged. He thought there\nmight\nbe a phone box in Hogsmeade, or maybe the next village over, which was non-magical. He could try.\nNow, as he took aim at the grey ticket barrier and started forward, he had that usual sensation of leaving the muggle world \u2013 and everyone in it \u2013 behind for another year. Grant did not exist on this side of the platform. Grant had never happened, and Remus was the same old Remus.\nNothing has changed\n, he told himself.\nNothing\n\nis\n\ndifferent\n. Matron hadn\u2019t insisted he cut his hair this time, so he wasn\u2019t beginning the term looking like an oik. He was taller, again \u2013 he wondered if he\u2019d ever\nstop\ngrowing sometimes \u2013 but other than these silly, superficial things, everything was as it had been. As it should be.\nNo one would notice, because there was nothing\nto\nnotice, Remus told himself, firmly. Nothing at all. He rubbed the back of his head, absent-mindedly, then \u2013 remembering Grant\u2019s fingers having been there only hours before, wiped his lips self-consciously. Shit.\n\u201cAll right you tosser?!\u201d James slapped him on the back out of nowhere.\n\u201cJames, really!\u201d Mrs Potter chastised her son, standing beside him. She beamed up at Remus, \u201cJust look at you! You\u2019ve grown inches!\u201d She pulled him into a hug, \u201cStill far too skinny for my liking!\u201d She began to straighten his clothes, peppering him with questions \u2013 did he have something to eat for the journey? Had he come alone? Did he want help getting his things aboard?\nBy the end of this motherly assault, Remus was grinning from ear to ear, relaxed in the knowledge that everything was, indeed, fine. Nothing was different at all. He cheerfully boarded the train with James and Peter, chattering about their summers and their excitement for the year ahead. James had a silver pin on his chest, emblazoned with a large \u2018C\u2019 (Remus could smell it the second James came close, an irritating sting in his nostrils) he had got his dearest wish and was now quidditch captain.\nThey sat in their usual compartment and Remus pulled his book from his bag, settling in with a satisfied sigh.\nThen Sirius walked in, and Remus\u2019s stomach dropped through the floor.\nHe was\nalmost\nthe same as ever \u2013 height-wise he had nearly caught up with James now, and he was broader about the chest. His jaw had squared, and perhaps his nose had lengthened \u2013 but he had the same glossy black hair, the same arresting eyes and high cheekbones.\nHe was still\nSirius\n, but he was somehow\u2026 other. As if Remus was seeing him through new eyes. The heat of desire flared up in his chest out of nowhere, settling in his cheeks as a heavy blush. He looked away, quickly, before anyone noticed.\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Sirius nodded graciously, entering the carriage like a prince.\n\u201cAlright?\u201d The other two grinned and Remus mumbled.\nSirius sat directly opposite Remus, his hair and uniform purposefully untidy \u2013 no doubt for the benefit of Walpurga Black \u2013 and flung out his legs, as if he didn\u2019t expect them to be as long as they were. His ankle bumped against Remus\u2019s, and Remus shot up, suddenly, sitting bolt upright and tucking his own gangly legs neatly under his seat. Sirius gave him a funny look, then a smirking grin which caused a sharp tug behind Remus\u2019s naval.\nOh god\n, he thought,\nno no no!\n\u201cHalf expected you not to be here,\u201d James said, relieved.\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t have the Black heir not turning up for his first day of school,\u201d Sirius rolled his dark blue eyes, raising an artful eyebrow, \u201cCouldn\u2019t have the whole wizarding world knowing that there\u2019s strife in my noble family.\u201d\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d James asked, earnestly, \u201cDid they\u2026 how are you?\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Sirius nodded, a bit stiffly, \u201cDon\u2019t want to talk about it now. Can we just pretend it\u2019s a normal first day?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, all right mate,\u201d James nodded, unconvincingly. \u201cPete was just telling us about California,\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t manage to find Phil,\u201d Peter said, \u201cHer housemates said she\u2019d moved on, everywhere we looked. Mum was\u2026 well she was really upset, it was crap.\u201d\nRemus felt a stab of guilt. It was so long ago now, but he had once told Philomena that she could run away if she wanted \u2013 \u2018no one says you have to use magic\u2019. After his own, blissfully simple, magic-free summer, Remus was starting to envy Peter\u2019s sister.\nThe train had pulled out of the station, and the grey London buildings were whooshing by, soon to give way to the lush greed fields of the home counties.\n\u201cHow was your summer, Moony?\u201d James asked, suddenly, and Remus realised Peter had stopped talking some time ago.\n\u201cYeah, fine,\u201d Remus had practiced this in his head on the way to King\u2019s Cross. But he hadn\u2019t counted on Sirius looking so\u2026 it was difficult to stay focussed. \u201cUsual. Nothing exciting. Um. Football, homework. Er\u2026 yeah, fine. Not great. But\u2026 well, fine, not bad. Fine.\u201d\nThankfully, the door to their carriage slid open, putting a stop to his blabbering. Lily Evans stood in the doorway, beaming with delight, her hair a fiery halo.\n\u201cEvans!\u201d James boomed, eagerly, \u201cYou found me!\u201d\n\u201cAs if it\u2019s hard, Potter,\u201d Lily rolled her eyes, \u201cYou lot are always in the same car. Anyway, I\u2019m not here for you, I\u2019m here for\nyou\n!\u201d She pointed at Remus, still grinning,\n\u201cMe?!\u201d Remus frowned, confused for a moment, then it dawned on him. He sighed, heavily, wanting to sink into his chair and disappear. The other three marauders and Lily were all staring at him with varying expressions, all expectant.\n\u201cYou got it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Lily said, impatiently, \u201cCome on, we have to go for a meeting in the\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMerlin!\u201d Sirius suddenly exclaimed, slapping his forehead comically. \u201cHow did we forget?! Moony, are you a\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA prefect!\u201d James yelled. Remus hung his head.\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell us immediately so that we could rip the piss out of you?!\u201d Sirius\u2019s face had lit up, some of the old eleven-year-old mischief maker showing through.\n\u201cYou\u2019re just jealous,\u201d Lily said, haughtily, \u201cCome on Remus, where\u2019s your badge?\u201d\n\u201cThe badge!\u201d Sirius burst out laughing, \u201cI forgot about the badge! Oh please, Moony, show us the badge!\u201d\nPeter and James\u2019s shoulders were shaking too, and Remus shook his head, trying to look disapproving.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in my trunk.\u201d\n\u201cWell put it on!\u201d Lily said, \u201cC\u2019mon, we have our own carriage and everything.\u201d\n\u201cHey Evans, I\u2019m quidditch captain, y\u2019know,\u201d\n\u201cYes, Marlene said.\u201d Lily said, without so much as glancing in James\u2019s direction, \u201cCome\non\n, Remus!\u201d\n\u201cUgh, ok. But the badge is right in the bottom of the trunk, I\u2019ll wear it tomorrow.\u201d Remus said, getting up.\n\u201cOh, no, we can look for it, if you want?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t be bothered.\u201d Remus shrugged, not looking at her.\n\u201cOh, go on,\u201d Sirius wheedled, getting up and reaching for Remus\u2019s trunk, \u201cWe want to see you in your nice, shiny badge\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Remus snapped, glaring at Sirius \u2013 thank goodness it was still easy to get annoyed with him \u2013 he raised his eyebrows, so Lily couldn\u2019t see, and said very pointedly, \u201cSilver isn\u2019t my colour.\u201d\nSirius\u2019s eyes widened immediately in realisation. Remus raised his eyebrows and followed Lily out. He glanced back through the glass door just in time to see James quickly removing his own pin.\n* * *\nBeing a prefect was as bad as Remus had expected. The letter had come as much as a surprise to him as to everyone else \u2013 the pin fell out of his usual Hogwarts reading list and into his lap one summer morning. He\u2019d hissed with pain as the silver burned his fingers, and dropped it on the floor. Grant picked it up,\n\u201cWhat the bloody hell is this?!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a prefect.\u201d Remus said, not believing it himself.\n\u201cA\u2026 a what?! Jesus, sometimes I think I\u2019ve made you up.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it,\u201d Remus had groaned, \u201cMy friends are never going to let me live this down\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHa! Good!\u201d Grant stuck out his pink tongue.\nRemus just shook his head again, and resolved to write a letter to Dumbledore about this, demanding that someone else be given the job. James would be good. Even\nPeter\nwould be better than Remus. Dumbledore had not responded. He tried McGonagall, who did respond, simply saying that the decision was final. Remus decided to try again once term started.\nOn the train, Lily and Remus had to attend an extremely tiresome meeting with all of the other prefects, led by the interminably boring Head boy and girl. After that, they were expected to \u2018patrol\u2019 the corridors, stopping anyone from having any fun. Unfortunately Lily took this duty very seriously, and Remus got the feeling it was going to be a very long year. Still, it was much preferable to sitting in a confined space with Sirius \u2013 he would have to do his best to steer clear for a while, until he\u2019d worked out this latest revelation.\nThe feast was ok. It felt less merry than previous years \u2013 Remus didn\u2019t know if that was his own turmoil, or the pallor of the war. There were less students than usual; only a handful of first years. No one was mentioning it.\nAfter dinner, Lily made Remus patrol again, and he actually didn\u2019t mind. He hoped that if he could stay away long enough the others would be in bed; then he wouldn\u2019t have to see them until lessons the next morning \u2013 if James and Sirius left early for quidditch practice.\n\u201cYou\u2019re still not wearing your pin,\u201d Lily said, as they walked the length of the fourth floor hall.\n\u201cYeah, sorry,\u201d Remus yawned, \u201cI\u2019ll find it tomorrow, promise.\u201d\n\u201cSo, how was summer?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, great!\u201d Remus grinned wider than he meant to. Lily smiled back at him, looking genuinely pleased.\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s lovely! What did you do?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 oh nothing. Loads of homework.\u201d\n\u201cWeirdo.\u201d Lily elbowed him, laughing, \u201cEven I don\u2019t like homework that much.\u201d\n* * *\nHe was right, by the time he got back to the common room, everyone had gone to bed, and the marauder\u2019s bedroom was dark and quiet. He padded quietly into the bathroom, brushed his teeth and pulled on his pyjamas, then crept over to his bed, drawing the curtains tight. It felt as though he had only just relaxed properly, when he heard Sirius get out of bed. He knew each of his roommates by their footsteps now. He used to like knowing it \u2013 now it felt like a peculiar kind of torture, as Sirius drew closer, and hissed;\n\u201cMoony? Psst\u2026 oi, even you don\u2019t fall asleep that easily!\u201d\nRemus groaned, crawled to the edge of the bed and opened the curtains.\n\u201cWhat??\u201d\n\u201cOh c\u2019mon, why are you avoiding us? Is it the prefect thing? You know we\u2019re just teasing, lighten up! Here, I\u2019ve got something for you.\u201d He opened his hand. In the dark, Remus leaned over and saw his red and silver prefect pin. He frowned,\n\u201cIs this a joke?\u201d\n\u201cNo, take it! Trust me, Remus.\u201d Sirius caught his eye, and Remus\u2019s mind went completely blank. He accepted the pin, waited, and felt\u2026 nothing. He blinked, and looked down,\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cTransfigured it,\u201d Sirius smiled, looking thrilled. His teeth gleamed in the dark. \u201cIt\u2019s tin, now. Did the same to James\u2019s. I reckon I can get Mary to pinch Evans\u2019s too, and I\u2019ll do that. You\u2019ll be spending loads of time with her, so might as well\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThank you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d Sirius shook his head, still smiling, eyes soft. \u201cAnything for our Moony. G\u2019night.\u201d He turned and crept back to his own bed.\nRemus fell back onto his pillows, exhaling heavily, still clutching the pin so tight it bit into his palm. He flung the covers over his head, and willed his heart to stop pounding.\nOh god\n, he thought, grimly.\nI fancy Sirius Black."

            "content": "Remus overslept the next morning, and would have missed breakfast if Peter hadn\u2019t shouted his name about a hundred times before leaving himself. As the door slammed, Remus rolled onto his back and stared at a chink of light coming through his curtains. He had slept badly, and resigned himself to sleeping badly every night until he\u2019d got this ridiculous Sirius thing out of his system.\nThe first thing to do was to\nstop thinking about it\n, he told himself, sternly, jumping up out of bed and heading straight for the shower. Cold as he could stand it. James and Sirius must have left early for quidditch. A memory of Sirius in his scarlet robes surfaced; hair pulled back, face glistening, that energetic, competitive glint in his eyes. Remus groaned, and turned the shower knob all the way down from lukewarm to icy.\nHe forced himself to think about something else \u2013 Charms, or Arithmancy, or History\u2026 yes, he found that listing off the names of the generals involved in each side of the Great Goblin revolt of 1642 seemed to calm him down a bit. Gave him something to focus on anyway. You couldn\u2019t have lustful thoughts with names like \u2018Krebshunk\u2019 and \u2018Frip the Disembowler\u2019 running through your head.\nHe dressed and headed down for breakfast. Their first lesson was Transfiguration, and you could never get away with being late for McGonagall. In the Great Hall, Peter was sitting at the Ravenclaw table with Desdemona, and they were clearly getting reacquainted after a very long summer apart. Remus sighed a little, inwardly, remembering how that felt. It was even worse to watch other couples snogging when you knew what you were missing.\nSirius and James were at the Gryffindor table, both dressed in their school uniform, but decidedly rumpled from practice. Their body language was very out of character; Sirius was turned away from James, nose in the air, James looked furtive and wound up - if Remus didn\u2019t know better, he\u2019d have thought they were in the middle of a row.\nAs he sat down opposite his two friends, he found that his first impression had been correct. They were sitting in stony silence, and it was clear that Sirius was being very stubborn about something.\n\u201cMorning.\u201d Remus said, tentatively, reaching for some toast and jam.\n\u201cMorning, your prefect-ness,\u201d Sirius replied, with half a smile. He was pouring spoonful after spoonful of brown sugar into his porridge.\n\u201cHiya, Moony,\u201d James said, glancing over at him briefly before turning back to Sirius. He looked worn out, stressed. It did not suit him. \u201cSirius.\u201d He said, very seriously.\nSirius ignored him. \u201c\nSirius\n.\u201d James repeated, louder.\n\u201cNot now, Potter. I\u2019m busy.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re playing with your breakfast.\u201d James wrinkled his nose, \u201cAnd please don\u2019t eat that, my teeth hurt just looking at it.\u201d\nRemus thought it looked good, actually. He liked very sweet things, especially when he was in a bad mood. He kept this opinion to himself. Best not to get involved, where James and Sirius were concerned.\nSirius finished pouring his last teaspoon of sugar, stirred it vigorously, until the mixture had turned the texture and colour of sand. He scooped up a heaped spoonful, then - making eye contact with James the whole time - shoved it in his mouth and chewed. Remus could hear the grains of sugar crunching between his teeth. James shook his head,\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be like\nthat\n, I\u2019m not Regulus.\u201d He said, grumpily.\nSirius scowled at him, then stood up.\n\u201cGotta go to the library.\u201d He said, his mouth still full of oversweet porridge. \u201cSee you in Transfiguration.\u201d\nJames sighed, heavily, watching Sirius leave. Remus breathed a small sigh of relief, but felt immediately guilty about it. There was obviously something wrong with his friend, and he ought to be as concerned as James.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He asked, hoping he sounded calm and caring.\n\u201cSee him limping?\u201d James said, still watching Sirius walk out of the hall. Remus looked. He had the same arrogant swagger as usual, his hair swishing and his shoulders back - but\u2026 yes, Remus thought James was right. He looked a little unsteady on his feet.\n\u201cSomething happen at practice?\u201d Remus frowned.\n\u201cNo.\u201d James shook his head, \u201cBeen like that since yesterday.\u201d\nRemus thought back, scanning his memories - Sirius had been sitting down most of the time Remus had seen him, and even then, Remus hadn\u2019t exactly been looking in great detail. In fact, he had been trying to do the complete opposite. His guilt took on a new dimension.\n\u201cYou think his mum did something?\u201d He asked, his stomach churning.\n\u201cI\nknow\nshe did.\u201d James replied, fiercely. He was looking at the Slytherin table, now. \u201cHe tried to hide it in the changing rooms, but I caught him in the showers and\u2026 Merlin, Moony, if you saw\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nJames shook his head, as if he wished he could shake out the image.\n\u201cShe\u2019s butchered him.\u201d\nA chill ran through Remus that was ten times more effective than a cold shower. All of a sudden he was eleven again, and back in the quidditch changing room after he and Sirius had crashed their brooms. Eleven-year-old Sirius whispered \u2018I\u2019ve got scars\u2026\u2019 and lifted his trouser leg to show the long, straight silver marks. At the time Remus had only thought how different they were from his own scars - how neat and uniform, as if they had been done with a razor blade. Later, Sirius had described the scars as a discipline technique, but they had never discussed it again.\n\u201cIs he ok?\u201d Remus asked, shakily, no longer wanting his toast.\n\u201cHe says he is.\u201d James replied, \u201cBut he won\u2019t\u2026 he won\u2019t talk about it, or say anything. Ugh, I shouldn\u2019t have brought up Regulus like that. He\u2019s just so bloody\nstubborn.\n\u201d\n\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Remus worried, \u201cHe can\u2019t go back there, it\u2019s not right. Can your family do something?\u201d\n\u201cThey tried, last summer,\u201d James said, sadly, \u201cBut no joy. If I can get him to go to someone; Dumbledore, or even Madam Pomfrey, if they could\nsee\nwhat that old bitch does\u2026 maybe we can get him out.\u201d\n\u201cHe won\u2019t, though.\u201d Remus sighed. Sirius would never show weakness like that.\n\u201cCan you try, Moony?\u201d James asked, desperately, \u201cHe won\u2019t talk to me, but sometimes you can sort of shock him into it.\u201d\n\u201cMe?!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, y\u2019know, I think he listens to you, sometimes. He always wants to impress you.\u201d\nOh why did James have to say a thing like that?\nThey went to Transfiguration, and found Sirius already there, studiously ignoring them. It was the same story for the rest of the day, even at lunchtime, Sirius engaged Mary and Marlene in conversation before James or Remus could get a word in. He kept them entertained with silly impressions of Peter and Desdemona, so that they were hysterical with laughter. James sat by, grim faced, his expression not flickering once.\nThey weren\u2019t able to trap Sirius alone until well after dinner. Peter was once again conspicuously absent, and Remus found that he and Lily were off the rota for patrol that evening.\nThey caught Sirius exiting the bathroom, and James stood in front of the door, so he couldn\u2019t escape into the common room. Remus decided to go for the direct approach.\n\u201cHeard you had a shit summer.\u201d He said, looking Sirius in the eye. It was easier, if you were ready for it. Sirius snorted,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s James been saying?\u201d\n\u201cThat you\u2019re hurt, but you\u2019re too much of a stuck-up git to admit it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not\nhurt\n.\u201d Sirius growled, disgusted. \u201cIt\u2019s healing.\u201d\n\u201cThis morning you were bleeding!\u201d James said, angrily, clearly at his wits end.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Remus said, alarmed, \u201cGod, Sirius, you have to go to Madam Pomfrey!\u201d\n\u201cAnd have the whole school know how my mother likes to amuse herself?! No thanks.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, because Madam Pomfrey tells the whole school everything\u2026\u201d Remus said, raising a sarcastic eyebrow. \u201cLet me see.\u201d\n\u201cNo! Godric, you\u2019re worse than Potter!\u201d\n\u201cCome on, I\u2019ve shown you mine.\u201d Remus caught his eye again and held it.\nHe saw Sirius calculating, weighing up the benefits, then slowly relenting.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want James to see.\u201d He said, looking down, embarrassed.\nRemus turned and looked at James, whose shoulders slumped a bit with disappointment. Still, stoic as ever, he nodded and promptly left the room. Remus felt very vulnerable, now, being alone with Sirius. He pushed all selfish thoughts aside and tried to concentrate on helping his best friend.\n\u201cC\u2019mon then,\u201d he nodded at Sirius, \u201cLet\u2019s see, one victim to another.\u201d He\u2019d meant that as a bit of a dark joke, but realised at once that it had been the wrong thing to say. He cursed himself and resolved to shut up unless he had something helpful to say.\nSirius sat on the nearest bed, which happened to be Remus\u2019s, and pulled up his trouser leg. Remus had to hold back a gasp of horror. James had used exactly the right word - butchered. These marks were not neat and ordered, as the earlier scars had been. They were vicious, cross-crossed, varying in depth and severity. The entire backs of his calves looked as though someone had sliced at them with a surgeon\u2019s scalpel.\n\u201cLacero?\u201d Remus asked, trying to keep his face blank. Sirius flinched slightly at the word, but nodded. \u201cBitch.\u201d Remus said. Sirius laughed.\n\u201cGoes all the way up.\u201d He said.\n\u201cShit.\u201d Remus breathed. He backed away, then went to his bedside table to rummage around, \u201cI\u2019ve got something that\u2019ll stop it hurting.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t--\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie,\u201d Remus commanded, pulling out his jar of murtlap essence, \u201cI know pain.\u201d\nSirius accepted this. Remus returned and handed him the jar. Sirius looked at it, then at Remus, expectantly.\n\u201cYou rub it on.\u201d Remus said. he shook the jar, impatiently, \u201cCome on, I\u2019m not doing it for you, I\u2019m not your house elf.\u201d\nHe thought he\u2019d been doing pretty well, but it would all come crumbling down if he had to\ntouch\nSirius, even somewhere as innocent as his calves. Sirius grinned and took the murtlap essence. He scooped out a liberal dollop with his long fingers, and smeared some onto his leg. Remus saw from the look in his face that it had worked at once; his features relaxed, some of the sharpness left his eyes. He must have really been in pain.\n\u201cBloody hell, you\u2019re amazing, Moony!\u201d Sirius said, cheering up as he continued to apply the essence. Remus blushed and shrugged,\n\u201cIt\u2019s just magic, not like I discovered the stuff.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but still\u2026\u201d Sirius stood up now, and began to unbutton his trousers so that he could do the rest of the cuts. Remus practically leapt back, and scrambled towards the door, babbling,\n\u201cI\u2019ll um\u2026 I\u2019ll give you some privacy\u2026 got to go anyway\u2026 homework\u2026\u201d his voice was much higher than he wanted it to be.\nHe practically ran down the stairs and bumped straight into James.\n\u201cIs he ok?!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah\u2026 I gave him something for it. Just give him a minute, I think he\u2019ll come down.\u201d\n\u201cBrilliant, thanks Remus.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t talk to him about going to a teacher or anyone\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but he\u2019s talking to\nus\n, now,\u201d James beamed. \u201cSeriously, thanks, Moony, you\u2019re a legend! We\u2019re going to pay you back\u2026 I\u2019m not supposed to say anything about it yet, but\u2026 well, I\npromise\nwe\u2019re going to!\u201d\nWith that, James clapped him on the shoulder, then ran up the stairs to see Sirius. Remus sank into a nearby armchair, and decided to reassess a few things. He had to get away, in case they came back down. He left the common room and went to the library, where he spent the rest of the evening painstakingly studying the goblin rebellions. It was OWLs this year, after all, and he couldn\u2019t allow his libido to wreck everything he\u2019d been working for.\nIt was almost curfew by the time he felt ready to leave. His eyes itched and his back ached, and he was in a bad mood \u2013 but at least he wasn\u2019t thinking about Sirius any more. Well. Not really.\nHe left the library and walked quickly up the dark corridors the Gryffindor Tower. He was at least halfway there when he heard an odd sort of noise \u2013 like a whimper \u2013 at the end of the Charms hallway. Sighing to himself, he went to investigate. Lily would have his guts for garters if he didn\u2019t. It was as he suspected. Two Slytherins had cornered a Ravenclaw first year, and were tormenting him. They had him in a binding curse \u2013 Remus had been in that position plenty of times.\n\u201c\nExpelliarmus\n,\u201d he called out, and the two Slytherin\u2019s wands flew into his hands. They turned, one dark haired, one fair. Barty Crouch and Regulus Black. \u201cOh,\nyou\ntwo\u2026\u201d Remus yawned, leaning casually against the wall.\nThe Ravenclaw scurried off, squeaking a quick \u2018thank you!\u2019 to Remus as he did.\n\u201cLoony Lupin!\u201d Barty smirked. He had a horrible smile, as if he had never really known joy, or happiness.\n\u201cWatch your tongue, Crouch,\u201d Remus hissed, then shot a curse at him.\nAt once, Barty\u2019s tongue began to swell up, turning purple as it did so. He clutched at it, desperately, but it was one of James\u2019s engorgement charms, and could not be stopped. \u201cBetter get to the hospital wing,\u201d Remus smiled, pleasantly. \u201cI\u2019ll send your wands to your Head of House, let him know you were out of bounds\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you!\u201d Regulus seethed, marching over to Remus. He was much shorter \u2013 almost the same height as Sirius, but it didn\u2019t stop him squaring up to the fifth year. The summer had clearly treated Regulus poorly too \u2013 he was paler than ever, his eyes dark and hollow. \u201cFilthy half-blood scum! You might be a prefect, but you\u2019re still just a cowardly, dirty---\u201c\n\u201cCowardly, am I?!\u201d Remus saw red, and dropped both wands, instead using his hands to ram Regulus up against the wall by his neck.\nThe younger boy\u2019s head hit the brick wall, and he blinked, genuine terror showing in his face. Remus didn\u2019t care; in fact, it was perfect. \u201cI may be a half-blood,\u201d Remus hissed, menacingly, \u201cBut at least I don\u2019t stand by and watch my family get cut to shreds!\u201d\nRegulus\u2019s eyes widened, and a terrible, haunted look came over him.\n\u201cI\ntold\nhim to stop pushing her, but he wouldn\u2019t listen!\u201d he whispered, \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop her\u2026\u201d\nDisgusted, Remus let go. Barty was still choking, further down the hall.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a coward, Regulus Black.\u201d Remus said, very quietly, \u201cDon\u2019t ever forget it.\u201d\nHe spat at Regulus\u2019s feet, and walked away."

            "content": "So inviting - so enticing to play the part\n\n\nI could play the wild mutation\n\n\nas a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll star\n\n\nI could do with the money (y\u2019know that I could...)\n\n\nI'm so wiped out with things as they are (y\u2019know that I should\u2026)\n\n\nI'd send my photograph to my honey\n\n\n- and I'd come on like a regular superstar.\n\nSaturday 20th September 1975\nOver the next three weeks, Remus managed to fall into a somewhat more comfortable routine as he learnt to navigate his newfound feelings. Once upon a time he might have simply tried to avoid Sirius; to withdraw and hide in the library, or one of his little corners. But he had learnt that this never worked in the end, especially when you shared a bedroom. And at any rate, he was far too big for most of his old cubby holes now.\nSo he simply tried to cope, and in trying, found that he could. Not that it was easy, exactly - but he had so much else to worry about. On top of prefect duties, which already had Remus up and down the castle for patrol duties and meetings, it was an important year for their studies.\nWith OWLs coming up, the teachers were loading them up with more work than ever - and there had been a noticeable shift in the syllabus. In Transfiguration they were learning concealment; in Charms they practiced disarming; Potions was largely focussed on identifying and counteracting poisons; and Defence Against the Dark Arts seemed to be nothing but drill after drill of attack and defence spells. They were training for war, and everyone knew it.\nCare of Magical Creatures was a grim affair. Professor Kettleburn was a grumpy, barking old man with half his limbs missing and an eye patch. He didn\u2019t bring anything in for them to look at, or tell them stories of his encounters with fantastical beasts - he preferred to recount how he had got all of his various injuries, and it was always horrible.\nRemus tried to spin this in a positive way - at least without Ferox there was one less distraction. There was no\nway\nhe was going to develop a crush on crusty old Kettleburn.\nSirius was quite enough to contend with.\nThough he managed to simply smile through his feelings most of the time, they seemed to surface at the most inopportune moments. He\u2019d be reading a book, and there it was. Or completely alone in the library, and a memory would pop up, stirring up his insides. It left him often shaken, too hot, and confused. If\nthis\nhad been how James and Mary and Marlene and Peter and everyone involved in the stupid snogging business had been feeling for the past two years, then Remus simply didn\u2019t know how any of them had got anything done. It seemed his mind and body were constantly at war.\nHe wasn\u2019t stupid; he knew he was something of a late bloomer where that sort of thing was concerned. The summer after he\u2019d turned thirteen, Matron had called him into her office and asked him in the vaguest terms possible how much he knew about \u2018marital relations\u2019. He wasn\u2019t very sure how much he\nought\nto know, and didn\u2019t want to look stupid, so he just said he knew \u2018everything\u2019. She nodded and told him to ask a male member of staff if he had any questions. Of course, he never had. They also once had a talk from the local vicar about the sanctity of marriage and the sinful nature of \u2018acting on base urges\u2019 - but Remus had been so mortified that he had blocked most of that out.\n\u2018Base urges\u2019. It wasn\u2019t something you were\nsupposed\nto talk about seriously \u2013 at least not with other boys, he knew that much. Jokes were ok; at least you were in safe territory if you just teased each other. But you certainly couldn\u2019t ask questions.\nThe other marauders were ahead of him; some nights close to the full moon he had caught the scent of their lust, had heard their quiet aching moments of frustration and shame as they fumbled under the bedsheets in the dark. It just embarrassed him. Of course, Remus\ndid\n, of course he\nhad\n\u2026 but that just felt like maintenance, with no more meaning assigned to it than brushing his teeth.\nEver since this past summer, though, things in that department had changed. Become more urgent. As if snogging Grant had activated him in some way; unleashed a great flood of\u2026\nfeelings\n. Remus rarely thought about anything else, he was constantly on edge. For once, he was grateful for the billowing black robes they were required to wear at Hogwarts, but even then he often found himself having to stay seated longer than everyone else sometimes, trying to think neutral thoughts. Once he had to cover his lap with a particularly heavy book, simply because McGonagall said \u2018wand work\u2019 too many times.\nHe felt changed on the inside; it was present in every moment \u2013 whether he was alone or in company. And Sirius.\nWhy\ndid it have to be Sirius?\nOk, he\nknew\nwhy. It was the way his thin white school shirt hung off his back, the way his hair fell in his eyes so that he had to push it back, even though he never, ever tucked it behind his ear. His hands. His fucking eyes...\n\nIt had been a very trying three weeks.\n\nRemus was grateful that this first full moon of the term had fallen on a weekend. It meant that he could sleep in and lounge around peacefully waiting for nightfall, rather than sitting through hours of lessons, bones aching on hard wooden seats. Saturday was also quidditch practice day (actually, ever since James became captain, quidditch practice was almost every day), leaving Remus completely, blissfully undisturbed.\nHe had slept in most of the morning, then wandered downstairs for lunch, before returning to the quiet of an empty bedroom. He read his book for a while, but feeling headachy and restless soon gave up. He wished the moon would hurry up and come, so he could get it over with. Waiting for it was the worst part. He closed his eyes, stretching out, then decided he was sick of lying down. He climbed off his bed, and went to sit on the windowsill with a packet of cigarettes. The last he had from the summer, given to him by Grant as a leaving gift.\nGrant. If Grant was here, at Hogwarts, would Remus feel the same about Sirius? Probably, he sighed to himself. And Grant was so canny at that sort of thing he\u2019d work it out right away. Maybe he would have some advice. If only he could call him, or even write a letter - but he was only allowed to send owls to Matron, and what if she read it?! Remus wished he had the compact mirrors James and Sirius had. Though how on earth he would explain them to Grant he had no idea.\nHe finished his first cigarette and started on another. It was soothing. Weed was better; he\u2019d had some after his last full moon, but he hadn\u2019t seen anyone at Hogwarts smoking it. He was on the outs with the smoking set anyway, as he was no longer supplying. The past summer\u2019s distractions had cost him in more ways than one.\nEvening was drawing in, and Remus\u2019s stomach began to rumble. He tried to eat light on full moons, anticipating the pain which sometimes made him sick. In the days afterwards, he would be ravenous, and could easily manage three or four plates per meal. He was just about to get up and go down, when the door opened.\nPeter, James and Sirius walked in, with curious looks on their faces. James looked very serious and quite cautious, as if he had to deliver some news and wasn\u2019t sure how Remus would take it. Remus knew it couldn\u2019t be bad news, though, because Sirius was grinning from ear to ear, showing every one of his perfect, pearly white teeth. Peter was wringing his hands, as usual, but he too had a small, wicked smile - the look he had when they were in the middle of a particularly devious prank.\n\u201cOh god,\u201d Remus said, before James could speak, \u201cWhat now? Why aren\u2019t you at quidditch?\u201d\n\u201cNo quidditch today!\u201d Sirius said, still grinning like a maniac. The energy coming off him was electric, burning hot - he was clearly extremely excited about something.\n\u201cWhere have you been, then?\u201d Remus asked, choosing to look at James, instead, to keep his voice level.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been practicing something else!\u201d Peter burst out, biting his bottom lip.\nRemus leaned back on the windowsill and looked at James again, raising a questioning eyebrow. James swallowed, his adam\u2019s apple bobbing, then cleared his throat,\n\u201cMoony,\u201d he said, \u201cYou may remember we had an idea, in third year\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou have ideas all the time, Potter, be specific,\u201d Remus said, irritably, lighting his third cigarette. His shoulders hurt, and his neck. He wasn\u2019t in the mood for games on a full moon, they should know this by now.\n\u201cThe\u2026 to help you with the\u2026 I know you said we shouldn\u2019t, um\u2026\u201d James ran his hand through his hair, \u201cBut we\u2019d already got so far with it, and\u2026 um\u2026 look, I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re sorry\u2026 but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSpit it out!\u201d Remus sighed, exhaling smoke. James looked panicked. He glanced at Sirius, then looked at his feet and mumbled,\n\u201c\nWe\u2019vebecomeanimagus\u2019\n...\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cOh for Merlin\u2019s sake!\u201d Sirius said, stepping forward, \u201cLook, Remus!\u201d\nAnd with that, Sirius promptly transformed into a very large black dog, and Remus fell off the window ledge in shock."

            "content": "The dog - Sirius the dog - barked twice and wagged its tail playfully as Remus picked himself up off the floor. He looked at James and Peter, who were both smiling sheepishly. He looked at the dog again, and it transformed back into Sirius, standing before him with the same mad grin.\n\n\n\u201cYou did it.\u201d Remus said, tonelessly, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you bloody did it.\u201d He sat down again, feeling a bit wobbly.\n\n\n\u201cAre you angry with us?\u201d James asked, his eyes huge and earnest.\n\n\n\u201cCan you all do it?\u201d\n\n\nPeter and James looked at each other, then nodded. Remus breathed in, his chest tight. \u201cGo on then,\u201d he whispered, \u201cShow me.\u201d\n\n\nAt once, James and Peter transformed into a huge, regal stag, and a fat brown rat. James\u2019s antlers scraped the low ceiling of their room, so that he had to bow his head slightly. Sirius laughed,\n\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t choose what we turned into,\u201d he explained. \u201cOtherwise Peter probably would have picked something else\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOi!\u201d Peter said, transforming back, \u201cRats are highly intelligent creatures, I looked it up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShame you\u2019re not.\u201d Sirius replied.\n\n\n\u201cNot everyone wants to be a big slobbering mutt,\u201d James transformed back too, and punched Sirius on the shoulder,\n\n\n\u201cAll right, Bambi, calm down,\u201d Sirius smirked, ruffling Peter\u2019s hair, \u201cJust having a laugh, aren\u2019t we, mate?\u201d\n\n\nPeter smiled back. He did look pretty happy. All of them did. Remus was still speechless. He watched them all as if they were strangers. Had they really done this - some of the most difficult magic, which required skill, concentration and - above all -\n\n\npatience\n\n\n, just for him?\n\n\n\u201cRemus?\u201d James asked, looking serious again, \u201cYou are angry aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Remus frowned, then shook his head, \u201cNo, no, not angry\u2026 I just\u2026\u201d He rubbed the back of his head, closing his eyes, \u201cI knew you\u2019d do it anyway, I knew you\u2019d try, at least. You never listen to me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry.\u201d James said, forlorn. Even Sirius had stopped bouncing about.\n\n\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t be sorry!\u201d Remus said, quickly, opening his eyes, \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done is amazing\u2026 you lot are amazing. I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\n\nHe cursed himself for not being able to thank them properly - for feeling everything so strongly, but being unable to put any of it into words. What was the point of all that reading if it didn\u2019t give you the words when you needed them?\n\n\nHe looked up again to find Sirius watching him - his smile was calmer now, and the light of understanding shone in his eyes. Remus\u2019s heart skipped a beat.\n\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d He said, quietly, just to Sirius.\n\n\n\u201cAnything for our Moony!\u201d Sirius grinned again, and suddenly everything was back to normal, and the dorm room was just their dorm room, and these incredible people were just his friends. \u201cCome on,\u201d Sirius said, brightly, addressing all of them, \u201cLet\u2019s go down for dinner. We\u2019ve got a long night ahead of us!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTonight?!\u201d Remus said, surprised, \u201cYou want to try it tonight?!\u201d\n\n\n\nOf course\n\n\n, he thought,\n\n\nthis is why they chose the very last moment to reveal themselves.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo time like the present,\u201d James smiled.\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t want to spend another night alone in that horrid shack when you don\u2019t have to, Remus?\u201d Peter said, earnestly.\n\n\nRemus thought about this as he followed the others down the many stairs and corridors to the Great Hall. He did not like being alone, right before the moon or right after it. He assumed the wolf didn\u2019t like being alone either, judging by the pain it caused him. But he had\n\n\nalways\n\n\ndone it alone. It had never been a question before.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t speak at all through dinner, picking at his plate listlessly. Sirius nudged him every now and then, and Remus threw him a smile, but went back to playing with his roast potatoes.\n\n\n\u201cRemus, you\u2019re not eating,\u201d Marlene said, concerned, \u201cThat\u2019s\n\n\nreally\n\n\nnot like you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm,\u201d he replied, putting his fork down, \u201cI don\u2019t feel well. I think I\u2019ll go to the hospital wing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh no, again?\u201d Marlene tilted her head in sympathy, \u201cYou poor thing.\u201d\n\n\nRemus shrugged and got up to leave. The marauders got up too and followed him out.\n\n\n\u201cHow are you going to do it?\u201d He asked, as he walked, not daring to look at any of them.\n\n\n\u201cPete\u2019s small, he can get us in,\u201d James said, eagerly, \u201cThen we\u2019ll use the cloak - it\u2019s a doddle to fit under now we can change.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk,\u201d Remus nodded, working it out, \u201cOk, if you can sneak in behind Pomfrey\u2026 she puts a locking charm on the door, otherwise.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Peter nodded, enthusiastically, \u201cWe\u2019ll do it, Remus, we will!\u201d\n\n\nOutside the hospital wing, he turned and looked at them all. It helped to be tall, at times like this.\n\n\n\u201cYou know I might kill you all.\u201d\n\n\nThey looked back at him without wavering. Sirius straightened his back,\n\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\nRemus sighed.\n\n\n\u201cOk. See you in an hour or so, then.\u201d And with that he entered the infirmary, without looking back. His heart was hammering in his chest - part excitement, part terror.\n\n\nIt was dangerous; it was so,\n\n\nso\n\n\ndangerous that his head hurt. But he had told them \u2018no\u2019 once before, and this was the result. He could only hope that they were quick enough and clever enough to escape, if things went wrong. And if they couldn\u2019t escape\u2026 he hoped that at least one of them would be brave enough to do what was necessary to ensure the three of them survived, even if it mean he wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be all right, dear?\u201d Madam Pomfrey asked, surveying him with worried eyes. \u201cI know the first night is a bad one\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, really.\u201d Remus said, sitting down on his little cot, as usual. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe very crack of dawn,\u201d the medi-witch promised. She gave him a quick kiss on the forehead before bustling out of the room. Remus breathed in deeply and looked around.\n\n\n\u201cAre you there?\u201d He breathed into the empty room.\n\n\nJames appeared suddenly, pulling back the cloak. Sirius and Peter quickly followed, transforming back from their animagus forms.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get used to that,\u201d Remus blinked. he bit his lip nervously and tried to smile, gesturing at the dingy room, \u201cWelcome to the Shrieking Shack\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMoony,\u201d James said, looking deeply troubled as he took in the surroundings, \u201cIt\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok. It\u2019s better than a cage.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\n\n\nis\n\n\na cage,\u201d Sirius said, sounding fierce.\n\n\n\u201cWhen will it happen?\u201d Peter asked, suddenly, standing behind the other two.\n\n\nRemus rolled his shoulders carefully to see how the ache was coming along.\n\n\n\u201cNot long,\u201d he said, flatly, \u201cFifteen minutes, maybe.\u201d\n\n\nThere were quiet for a bit. When Remus could feel his blood begin to boil, and that tell-tale tingling in his muscles, he suddenly panicked, \u201cNo one\u2019s ever seen it happen before.\u201d He said, staring at them all helplessly, \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2026 it\u2019s really, really ugly.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, Remus,\u201d James said, soothingly, \u201cWe know what to expect.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI might scream\u2026 I\n\n\nwill\n\n\nscream.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Sirius promised.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got your wands?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d they all withdrew them to show him.\n\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he nodded, looking at the floorboards. His back hurt, he could feel every vertebra pushing against the skin. \u201cIf I attack\u2026 if you can\u2019t control me\u2026 you\u2019re going to have to\u2026\u201d he faltered. It was starting. \u201cChange,\u201d he shouted, curling up on the bed, facing the wall, \u201cquickly!\u201d\n\n\nHis nerve endings caught fire, and the transformation began.\n\n\nIt hurts\n\n\n, his mind babbled, like a whinging child,\n\n\nit hurts it hurts it hurts\u2026\n\n\nhe started to lose his mind in the agony, aware someone was screaming, until he wasn\u2019t Remus anymore, and the screaming was a long, dark howl of anguish.\n\n\nHe finally rolled over, his body new and strong and powerful\u2026 he sniffed. He knew this place - his prison. He wanted to be free, he wanted to get out and run and hunt and kill\u2026 he was so hungry, so restless. He was about to howl again, run at the windows or scratch at the door. He sniffed the air. He was not alone.\n\n\nThe wolf turned its eyes on the three animals locked in with it. It growled, jumped down from the bed. It snapped his jaws, and stood tall, raising its tail to show dominance. The black one growled to, sniffing at the wolf. It stepped forward and the wolf snarled, still unsure. The black one lay down at the wolf\u2019s feet. It rolled over and showed its belly. Friend. The wolf, knowing itself to be the leader now, stopped growling. He recognised the scent of them; knew they meant no harm.\n\n\nThis was his pack - and he was no longer alone.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nRemus woke up choking and spluttering as he came back into his body. It was dark and dusty, like always, and his bones were still sore and tired, and his head still throbbed. But there was no blood; at least he couldn\u2019t smell it - couldn\u2019t taste it - and the pain was passing quickly, like water down a drain.\n\n\n\u201cMoony?\u201d Sirius\u2019s voice broke in, familiar and comforting. \u201cHere,\u201d\n\n\nRemus felt hot with shame as Sirius handed him a blanket to cover himself.\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he croaked, wrapping it around himself. He squinted as his vision unblurred, the shapes of his three friends swimming slowly into view, \u201cEveryone ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Sirius beamed, \u201cBetter than fine! It\n\n\nworked\n\n\n, Moony!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHere, c\u2019mon,\u201d James reached down and helped Remus to his feet, then supported him back over to the little bed. Remus still felt weak, as usual, but that was all. No cuts, no scratches - he had not hurt himself at all.\n\n\nHe pulled his blanket tighter around his body and looked up at his three best friends - the dearest people in the world. His eyes filled with tears and he looked down, quickly, embarrassed.\n\n\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d Sirius asked, sounding worried, \u201cDoes it still hurt?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Remus shook his head, smiling, \u201cI\u2019m just being silly.\u201d He wiped his eyes and looked at them again. James looked as regal and proud as ever, his glasses slightly askew, dark rings under his eyes, but smiling nonetheless. Peter was pink, flushed with excitement, and Sirius was utterly perfect, glowing as if he\u2019d just been handed the quidditch cup. Remus felt very frail and pathetic, all skinny and naked on the bed beside these heroes. \u201cWas it bad?\u201dHe asked, nervously, \u201cThe transformation?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was pretty awful.\u201d James said, honestly. The others nodded.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re so brave, Remus.\u201d Peter burst out.\n\n\n\u201cBut afterwards,\u201d Sirius said, eager to remember, \u201cAfterwards it was amazing - you weren\u2019t sure at first, but then I--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou submitted to me.\u201d Remus said, \u201cI remember.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI thought you couldn\u2019t remember anything that happened?\u201d James asked, cocking his head.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t, usually,\u201d Remus frowned, \u201cBut last night was different\u2026 I remember it all. I wasn\u2019t me, exactly, but I wasn\u2019t\n\n\nnot\n\n\nme either. Does that make sense?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sirius laughed. Remus laughed too. \u201cYou lot better get under the cloak. Madam Pomfrey\u2019s on her way. Could, er\u2026 someone pass me my clothes?\u201d\n\n\nSirius was the last to hide under the cloak, he was alive with joy, and kept transforming back and forth, unable to stay still. When they absolutely had to go, he squeezed Remus\u2019s shoulder gently, one last time,\n\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you, Moony? Didn\u2019t I tell you?!\u201d He whispered, feverishly.\n\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Remus smiled, weakly. He lowered his voice, so that no one else could hear him, and looked at Sirius carefully, \u201cWas it scary? Was\n\n\nI\n\n\nscary?\u201d He had no idea what he looked like in wolf form.\n\n\nSirius\u2019s expression did not flicker.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d He said, firmly. \u201cYou were beautiful.\u201d"

            "content": "Of course, Madam Pomfrey was completely confounded by Remus\u2019s blemish-free night in the shack.\n\u201cAmazing!\u201d She kept repeating, \u201cCompletely amazing\u2026\u201d\nRemus fobbed her off with some mad theory that he was \u2018maturing\u2019, and that must account for it. She didn\u2019t seem convinced, but the sweet nurse was just so pleased to find him unharmed that she didn\u2019t ask any questions about it. She kept him in the infirmary to sleep through Sunday, but by midday he felt as alert and energetic as he did when the moon was waning.\n\u201cI\u2019ve no reason to keep you here,\u201d Madam Pomfrey smiled, still not quite believing it. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in cluttering up my ward with healthy patients.\u201d\nRemus practically skipped back to Gryffindor tower, taking the stairs two steps at a time. He was unsurprised to find the marauders all in bed still, though James and Peter were showing signs of life.\n\u201cAll right, Moony?\u201d James smiled sleepily, pulling back his bed curtains at the sound of the dormitory door.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Remus whispered back, not wanting to wake Sirius. He hated having his sleep interrupted at the best of times, and today Remus really felt he deserved a lie in. Plus, \u2018\nyou were beautiful\n\u2019 had been ringing in Remus\u2019s ears all day, and he wasn\u2019t sure yet how he would ever be able to speak to Sirius again.\n\u201cPomfrey say anything?\u201d\n\u201cNah, she can\u2019t work out what she did differently. We got away with it.\u201d\n\u201cGreat!\u201d James yawned, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to get some \u2018pepper up\u2019 pills or something for next time - it\u2019s a Monday.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do it every month\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShuddup, Moony,\u201d Peter called out, groggily, \u201cWe\u2019ll do whatever we like.\u201d\nRemus smiled to himself, collected his books and crept down to the common room so as not to disturb them any further.\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Marlene cried, \u201cThank goodness, I am so stuck on this stupid History question\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhich one did you pick?\u201d Remus settled down at a desk with the girls. \u201cGoblin rebellion?\u201d\n\u201cTroll uprising.\u201d Marlene sighed mournfully. \u201cI thought it would be easier.\u201d\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Remus replied, sifting through his notes to see what he had on the troll uprising. He found trolls pretty dull, himself, but he had dutifully taken down everything Professor Binns had said. Even though Sirius had been passing notes all the way through that lesson.\nBeautiful.\nBeautiful\n. What did that mean? It was a good thing, obviously. A word that could only ever be positive. But Sirius had said it. Worse, he had said it about Remus\u2019s wolf form. So, it might mean any number of things \u2013 Remus had created a shortlist in his head.\nFor example, \u2018you were beautiful\u2019 might mean:\n\n\u201cYou\nwere\nbeautiful last night, as a wolf, but you are\nnot\nbeautiful this morning as a human.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were beautiful last night\nbecause\nI was a dog, and dogs are in a good position to judge canine beauty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am\ntelling\nyou that you were beautiful, even though it isn\u2019t true, because I don\u2019t want to hurt your feelings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\nare\nbeautiful all the time and would very much like to snog you.\u201d\n\nRemus was willing to admit that option 4 was the least likely. He finally found the notes and passed them to Marlene.\n\u201cSkim through and let me know if you get stuck. Some of it\u2019s a bit confusing, but I\u2019ve got some good tricks for remembering the key dates.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver, Remus!\u201d Marlene gushed, looking relieved.\n\u201cAt least you\u2019ve finished your Transfiguration essay,\u201d Mary frowned, looking just as frazzled as Marlene. \u201cI\u2019m so behind, I\u2019m going to be up all night.\u201d\n\u201cDo you need a hand?\u201d Remus asked, reaching for his own Transfiguration homework, which just needed a quick proof-read before it was ready to hand in.\n\u201cOh, no thank you\u2026\u201d Mary blushed, looking down, \u201cUmm\u2026 Sirius promised to help, actually. You know, because he\u2019s really good at Transfiguration.\u201d\nMarlene giggled,\n\u201c\nAnd\nhe\u2019s asked her to go to Hogsmeade with him\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, has he?\u201d Remus asked, his mouth suddenly very dry.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Mary grinned, looking very pleased with herself. Remus couldn\u2019t blame her. Lucky cow. \u201cI know I dumped him before,\u201d Mary said, in a hushed tone, \u201cBut we were just kids then. He\u2019s\nso\nmuch more mature now.\u201d\nLily gave a sarcastic snort, but didn\u2019t look up from her own work. Remus just smiled and nodded, looking down at his Charms textbook. He wasn\u2019t much in the mood for homework now. Marlene and Mary continued to giggle and whisper about Sirius.\nRemus gave himself a stern telling off. It wasn\u2019t fair to feel the way he did \u2013 not fair to Mary, and not fair to Sirius. In fact, it was incredibly selfish. Sirius hadn\u2019t spurned him, or set out to hurt him deliberately. Quite the opposite \u2013 Sirius had gone out of his way to make Remus feel safe and comfortable in his own skin. It was horribly ungrateful of Remus to get upset over a stupid thing like this.\nReally, it was none of his business\nwho\nSirius went to Hogsmeade with. Remus himself had never had any interest in Mary Macdonald, so the churning, sick feeling in his stomach was completely out of place. And his friends were\nallowed\nto have girlfriends, if they wanted. It was\nnormal\n. Sirius deserved a bit of normality, after the summer he\u2019d had.\nHe thought about it all evening, and into the next day. About Mary, and Sirius, and \u2018you were beautiful\u2019... Would Sirius tell Mary she was beautiful? She\nwas\nbeautiful, it would be a fair statement \u2013 not just her soft curves and chocolate brown eyes, but the spatter of freckles on her nose, her warm brown skin \u2013 which had never been spotty, like every other teen in their year, but glowed like mahogany. Her laughter, her humour, her quick wit. She was a good match for Sirius.\nThe thing was, Remus decided, if a\nboy\ntold a\ngirl\nshe was beautiful, there could really be no doubts about what his intentions were. Boys telling other boys they were beautiful was a bit blurrier \u2013 especially when neither party had all of the information.\nAfter all, Remus repeatedly told himself, Sirius had no idea what he had been up to all summer. As far as Sirius knew \u2013 as far as anyone at Hogwarts knew, Remus was just as interested in girls as every other boy his age. So it could easily be read as a completely platonic, innocuous compliment. On the other hand, a small, wheedling voice would whisper, Sirius had\nalways\nknown Remus better than Remus knew himself. He had always been able to suss him out \u2013 the reading problem, the lycanthropy \u2013 why not this too? Was it so terrible to hope?\n* * *\nSaturday 4th October 1975\nAfter a week of restless nights, Remus was desperate for someone to talk to. And this time there was truly no one he\ncould\ntalk to. Everyone knew slightly different shades of Remus, based on the secrets they were aware of. The marauders knew he was a werewolf \u2013 but only Sirius knew about his struggles with reading. Lily knew about the reading, but not about the werewolf problem. Mary and Marlene knew least of all, and he liked it that way.\nThere was only one person in all the world who knew about his newest secret \u2013 and that person was nearly impossible to get in touch with. However, Remus was more than just a werewolf with reading problems and a gargantuan crush on his best friend. Above all things, he was a marauder; and nothing was impossible to a marauder.\nLast year, Mary had told him there was an old muggle phone box on the outskirts of Hogsmeade which was still in service. All he needed to do was get to it without anyone asking where he was going, and make sure Grant was waiting on the other end, back in Essex.\nThe first part was easy \u2013 Sirius and Peter would both be occupied on the next Hogsmeade weekend with their respective dates. James, though he had asked Lily out several times already this term, would be at a loose end, but was much less nosey than Sirius. Remus thought he could get away from him without much effort.\nGetting a message to St Edmund\u2019s was much more difficult, and in the end Remus settled for owling Matron. He wrote her a quick note explaining that he would not be back for Christmas \u2013 this was completely redundant, as so far he had not spent one Christmas as St Edmund\u2019s since he was eleven, but it served his purposes. He enclosed a second envelope, addressed to Grant Chapman, with an even briefer note inside:\n\n\u2018Saturday 4th Oct. Phone box on Station Approach. 12pm.\u2019\n\nAfter that, Remus just had to hope for the best.\nHogsmeade weekend arrived, and Remus had somewhat forgotten that as a prefect, he had certain duties to perform, which slowed him down a great deal. He and Lily had to check all of the third year\u2019s names off their list of students who had the correct permission slips, then lead them all down to the village.\nLuckily, James soon grew bored of following Remus down, bringing up the rear of a long line of excitable thirteen year olds, and he disappeared off to look at the latest quidditch supplies. In the end, Remus did not make it to Hogsmeade until half past twelve, so when Lily was finally satisfied they had shepherded every last third year, he had to run as fast as he could to the edge of town, praying nobody noticed him.\nHogsmeade was the only village for miles and miles around, and there was only one path which lead to and from it. Remus suspected this road was seldom used, as wizards had so many other means of travel. The tall, red phone box looked very strange, then, standing by itself surrounded by lush green Scottish hillsides. Remus thanked his lucky stars it was unoccupied \u2013 he had been worried he\u2019d arrive to find some muggleborn student already in there, tying up the line. But no, he was quite alone. He opened the door and stepped inside, punching in the number as quickly as possible.\nIt only rang twice, before a crackly voice answered on the other end.\n\u201cHjhfrd\u2026\u201d it seemed to say.\n\u201cHello\u2026 hello, can you hear me?\u201d Remus said, loudly into the receiver.\n\u201cWotcher, Remus,\u201d Grant\u2019s voice returned, slightly tinny, but much clearer, and as cheeky and cheerful as ever. Remus felt at ease for the first time in weeks. \u201cCor, been waiting an hour in this bloody box.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Remus said, \u201cTook longer than I thought to get away. You got my message, then?\u201d\n\u201cI did. Very flattered, I must say. Missin\u2019 me, are ya?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Remus said, quickly \u2013 and he realised he meant it. Sirius had been a distraction of epic proportions, but he had to admit that he\u2019d felt a little bit lonely without Grant around. \u201cHow are you?\u201d\n\u201cSame old. How\u2019s school?\u201d\n\u201cFine, fine\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 I wanted to ask you something.\u201d\n\u201cGo for it.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026 you know that day when we were\u2026 um, early in the summer, when we were sitting outside, and you\u2026 you--\u201d\n\u201cSnogged ya face off?\u201d\nRemus felt himself blushing hard against the cold plastic receiver.\n\u201cYeah. Er\u2026 well, I wanted to ask. Um. How did you...\nknow\n?\u201d\n\u201cOh gawd,\u201d Grant sighed heavily, \u201cWho is it?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you--\u201d\n\u201cYou fancy someone, right? Some posh boy at school? And you wan\u2019 me to tell you what signs to look out for, see if he fancies you back.\u201d\nRemus blinked. That was pretty much exactly what he wanted. \u201cWell,\u201d Grant said, \u201cSorry to let ya down, me ol\u2019 duck, but I\u2019ve got nuffin\u2019 for ya. Nine times out of ten they\ndon\u2019t\nfancy you back, so don\u2019t get your hopes up. Eight times out of ten they\u2019ll beat the living daylights out of ya if you try it on. Hope \u2018e\u2019s not on the rugby team, or whatever it is you toffs do.\u201d\n\u201cNo. And I don\u2019t think he would\u2026 he wouldn\u2019t\u2026 he\u2019s my friend.\u201d Remus ended, lamely.\n\u201c\u2018e ever done anything to make you think he\u2019s one of us?\u201d\n\nOne of us.\n\n\u201cErm\u2026 not exactly.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018e got a girlfriend? Or is it a boys only school? Always fancied goin\u2019 to one of them.\u201d\n\u201cThere are girls,\u201d Remus sighed. \u201cAnd yeah, he\u2019s um\u2026 well actually he\u2019s gone out with a girl today.\u201d\n\u201cAh, well it don\u2019t sound like your luck\u2019s in, mate. I mean, he\nmight\ngo both ways, but I dunno how likely that is, to be honest.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus sighed.\nHe called me beautiful\n, he wanted to say.\nSurely he couldn\u2019t be so cruel as to say a thing like that and not mean it?\nThrough the silence that followed, Grant laughed softly on the other end of the phone,\n\u201cOh Remus, love. Real stunner, is \u2018e?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno what to do.\u201d Remus replied, closing his eyes and leaning hopelessly back against the booth.\n\u201cNuffin\u2019 you can do. It won\u2019t last forever, don\u2019 worry. You\u2019ll move on \u2013 just look after yourself.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cAnytime. You\u2019re back next summer, yeah?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cChristmas?\u201d\n\u201cProbably not.\u201d\n\u201cShame. Crap here by myself. Had to play footie yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you hated football.\u201d\n\u201cNah, jus\u2019 told you that so you\u2019d like me.\u201d\nRemus laughed.\nThough the phone call had not taught Remus anything he hadn\u2019t already known, he felt a lot better for it. He headed back into Hogsmeade with a spring in his step, looking forward to a visit to Honeyduke\u2019s before finding his friends in the Three Broomsticks. Grant was quite right \u2013 of\ncourse\nSirius was a no go. Eventually Remus\u2019s feelings towards him would cool off.\nThis new, positive outlook did not last long. Remus had no sooner set foot back in Hogsmeade, when Severus Snape appeared, slinking out from an alleyway between two cottages.\n\u201cLupin.\u201d He said, coldly. He looked worryingly calm and collected, his beady black eyes fixed on Remus.\nAt fifteen, Snape was even more awkward looking than he had been at eleven. Adolescence had ravaged him; his limbs had grown gangly, his nose even more hooked, and he had a terrible case of acne, which put Remus in mind of their itching powder prank in first year.\n\u201cAll right, Snivellus?\u201d Remus huffed, walking past, \u201cForaging in other people\u2019s bins, are you?\u201d\nSeverus walked alongside him, smirking.\n\u201cWhat were you doing, leaving Hogsmeade?\u201d\n\u201cNone of your business, creep.\u201d\n\u201cYou were gone for almost an hour.\u201d\n\u201cDid you follow me?!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re up to something.\u201d\n\u201cGet lost, or I\u2019ll give you detention.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complete joke that you got made prefect.\u201d Severus said, quite out of the blue. Snape had not been made a prefect for Slytherin. \u201cThough I suppose you\u2019re the best of a bad lot.\u201d\n\u201cLook, you\u2019re not going to get a rise out of me.\u201d Remus said, through gritted teeth. He would walk faster if he could, but his gammy hip was playing up again. \u201cI\u2019d tell you to bugger off back to your mates, but I know you haven\u2019t got any.\u201d\n\u201cI know about you,\u201d Snape hissed, \u201cCare home brat.\u201d\n\u201cThis care home brat beat you at Arithmancy last year. And History.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll find out what you\u2019re up to.\u201d\n\u201cWell, good luck.\u201d Remus knew he had done a good job of covering his tracks \u2013 even if Severus found out he had made a phone call, what did that matter? \u201cI really don\u2019t know what\u2019s got you so wound up, Snivellus. Not enough first years to curse or something?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s something not right about you.\u201d Snape said, falling back now as a gang of sixth years approached, \u201cLily doesn\u2019t believe me, but I\u2019ll work it out. So watch your back,\nLoony Lupin\n.\u201d\nRemus swore at him, and marched off towards Honeyduke\u2019s, hoping that he looked more careless than he felt."

            "content": "\u201cHe wants a party, obviously.\u201d James said, walking between lessons one afternoon.\n\n\n\u201cIn our dorm?\u201d Remus asked, struggling with his ridiculously heavy book bag.\n\n\n\u201cCommon room, I think. He wants everyone involved.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Remus smiled fondly. He shifted his bag again.\n\n\n\u201cWant me to levitate that for you? I levitated Pete all the way up to divination, yesterday.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs that how he got that bruise?\u201d Remus raised an eyebrow.\n\n\n\u201cNot my fault Sirius shut the trap door too soon. Anyway, this birthday party - I think he wants it to be like yours last year.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Remus shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m not carrying him all the way back from Hogsmeade in that state again.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, still in the common room. I just mean he wants alcohol. It\n\n\nis\n\n\nhis sixteenth\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not holding his hair back when he starts puking, either.\u201d Remus said firmly.\n\n\nJames ruffled his hair as a group of girls walked past, all staring at him. Sometimes Remus was glad he had no interest in the opposite sex, because otherwise walking around with the quidditch captain might be unbearable. No wonder Peter liked to flaunt Desdemona so much.\n\n\nThe Sirius and Mary saga was currently at tolerable levels. Nothing had happened during the Hogsmeade visit, as far as Remus knew - and Mary would have almost certainly told him if it had. Apparently she wanted him to \u2018prove\u2019 that he could be a gentleman before she consented to be his girlfriend.\n\n\n\u201cA gentleman!\u201d Sirius scoffed, when the marauders were alone, \u201cI speak five languages! I have a family motto! I can ballroom-bloody-dance! I have\n\n\ntwelve\n\n\nsets of dress robes! What more does she want??\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNow you know my pain.\u201d James sighed in response.\n\n\n\u201cShe wants you to respect her,\u201d Peter tried to explain.\n\n\n\u201cI do respect her!\u201d Sirius said, piously, \u201cShe\u2019s got the best tits in the year. That\u2019s very respectable.\u201d\n\n\nRemus buried his head in his hands to hide the fact that he was smiling - because\n\n\nsurely\n\n\nSirius was never going to get a girlfriend with that attitude.\n\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d James said, now that the girls had passed and they were almost at the Great Hall, \u201cGood idea? Big party, lots of noise, lots of booze, lots of girls?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, yeah, sounds great!\u201d Remus replied, half-heartedly.\n\n\n\u201cAww, I know you\u2019re shy, Moony, but I swear, loads of girls like you. You just need to know how to talk to them.\u201d\n\n\nRemus thought that was a bit rich, coming from James \u2018oi, Evans!\u2019 Potter, but he said nothing. \u201cAnyway,\u201d James went on, grinning as they entered the hall. \u201cYou can be the JD, you know all the music.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe\n\n\nDJ\n\n\n,\u201d Remus corrected.\n\n\n\u201cWhatever. All right, Wormtail?\u201d James elbowed Peter, who was sitting with his girlfriend at the Ravenclaw table. She frowned at James,\n\n\n\u201cWhy have you started calling him that?? It\u2019s a terrible nickname!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d Remus smirked, \u201cSuits him down the the ground.\u201d\n\n\nPeter flicked two fingers at both of them and returned to his lunch. They\u2019d all been playing about with nicknames, partly because they wanted to finish the map by Christmas and needed the aliases, partly because James and Sirius just liked the idea of having codenames. They\u2019d made a game of never calling each other by the name name twice, but after \u2018squeaker\u2019, \u2018whiskers\u2019, \u2018scabbers\u2019 and \u2018cheese-muncher\u2019 had been tested, \u2018Wormtail\u2019 had ended up sticking for Peter.\n\n\nRemus was loving every minute - now they knew how he felt. Though he had to admit, he had grown quite fond of \u2018Moony\u2019.\n\n\nThey sat at the Gryffindor table. Sirius and Mary were already there, chatting animatedly.\n\n\n\u201cFido,\u201d James nodded, as he sat.\n\n\n\u201cRudolph.\u201d Sirius replied, with an an identical nod.\n\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019ve you two been?\u201d Mary asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you have a free?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLibrary.\u201d Remus said, reaching for the soup ladle, standing to lift the lid on the steaming tureen between them. Tomato - his favourite. \u201cYou two are acting like we don\u2019t have OWLs coming up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my revision at Christmas,\u201d Mary shrugged, \u201cI\u2019m not that fussed. I\u2019m more nervous about the career interviews.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCareer interviews?\u201d Remus sat down, alarmed.\n\n\n\u201cLily was telling me,\u201d Mary explained, \u201cAfter OWLs we have to go and have a meeting with McGonagall about what to do after school finishes. No idea what I\u2019ll say - if this war carries on I won\u2019t even be able to get a job as a muggleborn.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou will,\u201d James said fiercely, \u201cWe\u2019re going to win.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, even so,\u201d Mary shrugged, \u201cI dunno what I want to do when we leave. The only wizard job I know anything about is teaching, and I definitely don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\n\n\nAn owl appeared from somewhere above them, landing beside Sirius\u2019s plate. He rolled his eyes - it was a Black family owl.\n\n\n\u201cAt least it\u2019s not a howler.\u201d James said, cheerfully, buttering his bread roll. Sirius ripped open the white envelope and Remus watched his blue eyes flicker across the text. He stood up, looking over at the Slytherin table. Mary, Remus and James all turned to look too. Regulus was watching his brother. Sirius made eye contact with him, raised the letter and his wand, and said,\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nIncendio.\n\n\n\u201d\n\n\nMary yelped as the piece of parchment burst into flames between Sirius\u2019s fingers. Sirius sat back down, satisfied.\n\n\n\u201cBad news, then?\u201d James asked, returning to his lunch.\n\n\n\u201cA summons to spend my birthday with my darling brother.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell. Is that so bad?\u201d James asked.\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Remus said, sternly. He had not forgotten the vicious cuts on the backs of Sirius\u2019s legs.\n\n\n\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d A voice behind them spoke. Regulus had actually left the Slytherin table to confront his brother. Sirius ignored him, instead continuing to eat his food. \u201cSirius.\u201d Regulus said, louder this time, \u201cWhy did you burn that letter?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Mary,\u201d Sirius said, standing up again, carefully avoiding eye contact, \u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019ve got Charms next, haven\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t from mum,\u201d Regulus said, his eyes overbright and his cheeks turning unnaturally pink, \u201cI wrote it myself, I wanted to see you.\u201d\n\n\nBut Sirius was having none of it, and had already swept away from the table, Mary on his arm.\n\n\n\u201cI can talk to him, if you want?\u201d James turned to Regulus.\n\n\nThe younger Black brother blinked a few times, then glared at James. Remus could see his long eyelashes glittering with angry tears.\n\n\n\u201cPiss off, Potter, no one asked you. If he\u2019s happy with his mudblood girlfriend then fine. I don\u2019t care!\u201d And with that, Regulus gave his own flounce, returning to his friends on the other side of the hall.\n\n\nJames sighed, heavily, playing with his soup.\n\n\n\u201cReal flair for the dramatic, those Blacks.\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThursday 30th October 1975\n\n\nSirius\u2019s birthday fell rather unfortunately on a Monday that year, so they decided to hold the party on the Saturday which preceded it. This was not long after the marauder\u2019s second full moon spent together in the Shrieking Shack, which had been just a successful as the last, if not moreso, because they were all much more prepared.\n\n\nRemus had managed to get hold of two bottles of firewhisky from a seventh year who had once bought cigarettes from him - James paid, of course. The rest of the Gryffindors were quite used to marauder parties now, and those who weren\u2019t interested were armed with silencing charms for their dorm rooms. Lily did not think this was reasonable.\n\n\n\u201cReally, Remus, we can\u2019t disrupt the whole house just because it\u2019s Sirius\u2019s birthday!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Remus yawned. It was late, and they were patrolling the fourth floor again. \u201cWe did it last year. And the year before that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLast year coincided with a quidditch victory.\u201d Lily said, \u201cThat was a house celebration.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, so\u2019s this.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, this is a Sirius celebration.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah. Everyone loves Sirius.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHmph.\u201d\n\n\nIt was true - Lily was potentially the only Gryffindor who didn\u2019t at least find James and Sirius funny. Everyone else loved the idea of a party. \u201cYou ought to put a stop to it.\u201d she said.\n\n\n\u201cWhy me?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re a\n\n\nprefect\n\n\n, Remus. Why d\u2019you think they gave you that badge?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBelieve me, I have no idea.\u201d He yawned again. His eyes itched with tiredness, \u201cHave we done enough, yet?\u201d He whinged, \u201cHaven\u2019t seen any students for ages.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d Lily said, catching his yawn. \u201cI\u2019ll just check the girl\u2019s loo\u2019s here, then let\u2019s head back.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d Remus leaned against the wall and waited while Lily went in to investigate. She was nothing if not thorough. She clearly loved being a prefect as much as James loved being quidditch captain.\n\n\nRemus was definitely\n\n\nnot\n\n\nenjoying the responsibility. As if he didn\u2019t have enough to do, with OWLs on the horizon, not to mention full moons, a war and keeping on guard for various Slytherin attacks. Speaking of which.\n\n\n\u201cLoitering outside the girls loos?\u201d A voice slithered up from behind him. Remus turned to see Snape coming around the corner. \u201cHoping Moaning Myrtle will go out with you if you ask nicely?\u201d\n\n\nRemus groaned and rolled his eyes,\n\n\n\u201cOh piss off, will you. I really will give you detention this time; you\u2019re out of bounds.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust try it.\u201d Severus narrowed his eyes.\n\n\n\u201cGo back to your dorm.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMake me.\u201d\n\n\nRemus had been doing his utmost to keep his temper under control this year - and he\u2019d been doing fairly well, other than that small altercation with Regulus. But Snape seemed very keen to make himself an exception. Ever since their encounter in Hogsmeade, Remus had noticed the Slytherin student watching him; appearing from behind corners or following him into classrooms. This was the latest in a string of recent ambushes, and Remus\u2019s nerves were wearing thin.\n\n\nFortunately for Severus, at that very moment Lily completed her inspection and walked out of the toilets.\n\n\n\u201cSev!\u201d She said, sounding half surprised, half concerned. Her eyes flashed between Snape and Remus, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was just telling Snivellus that he\u2019s about to get a detention for being out of bounds\u2026\u201d Remus said, smugly. He knew that Lily was one of the only people Snape cared about, and that the last thing he wanted was to lose face in front of her.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call him that!\u201d She frowned. \u201cYou really ought to be in your own common room at this time of night,\u201d Lily said to Severus, reproachfully.\n\n\n\u201cI wanted to make sure you were ok,\u201d Severus said, smoothly, \u201cIt isn\u2019t safe wandering around the castle with delinquents.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWatch it, Snape,\u201d Remus withdrew his wand.\n\n\n\u201cWatch what, muggle-lover?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou slimy, filthy\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStop it, both you you!\u201d Lily shouted, pulling out her own wand, \u201cOr I\u2019ll turn you both into mice and you can take your chances with Mrs Norris!\u201d\n\n\nThey both stared at her, dumbstruck. \u201cQuite right,\u201d she said, drawing herself up to full height. \u201cNow, Severus, go back to the dungeons. Remus, shut up and come with me.\u201d\n\n\nWith that, she stormed off, plaits bouncing behind her like two copper whips.\n\n\nRemus had to walk very fast to catch her up, and was panting by the time they reached the top of the second staircase.\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t start it, you know,\u201d he told her, \u201cOl\u2019 Snivellus has been following me around all year, the slimeball.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it!\u201d She snapped, \u201cI don\u2019t even care who started it anymore, you lot or him, I think you\u2019re all horrible bullies.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLily!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI mean it, Remus, I\u2019ll curse you!\u201d\n\n\n\nGirls\n\n\n. Remus thought, grumpily, as he let her go on ahead, rubbing his poor hip.\n\n\nMental. Every last one.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nSaturday 1st November 1975\n\n\n\nWell you can bump and grind\n\n\n\n\nIf it\u2019s good for your mind\n\n\n\n\nYou can twist and shout\n\n\n\n\nLet it all hang out\n\n\n\n\nBut you won\u2019t fool the children of the revolution...\n\n\n\nThe Slytherins might all have high profile careers ahead of them. The Ravenclaws probably kept the coolest heads in an emergency. And if you wanted a anything done well then you could count on a Hufflepuff. But Gryffindor Tower threw a bloody good party.\n\n\nWord had got out, and a steady stream of Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw students were sneaking in through the portrait hole - which was supposed to be manned by Peter, who had got drunk very quickly and was apparently extremely hospitable after a few firewhiskies. By ten o\u2019clock the common room was heaving, awash in dazzling red and gold, full of chatter, laughter and music.\n\n\nRemus had started off in charge of the record player, and had implemented a system, based on the way a muggle jukebox worked using a simple levitation/locomotor spell combination. However, things had quickly got out of hand, and in the end he\u2019d abandoned his post in favour of having a good time. Sirius, who was on his third or fourth whisky by now, was having the time of his life; centre of attention and surrounded by girls.\n\n\nThe Gryffindor girls had been pouring over a copy of\n\n\nMarie Claire\n\n\nall afternoon, and Remus noticed that they were all dressed very differently for this year\u2019s party - their skirts had got shorter, the colours less conservative and the makeup was something else.\n\n\nMary had performed a spell on her eyelashes that made them long and thick, like bat\u2019s wings. She looked utterly stunning in a royal blue mini skirt and white blouse with long bell sleeves, cut low to accentuate what Sirius called \u2018the best tits in the year\u2019. Marlene was very striking too, her fair hair combed out for once, rather than in its usual practical ponytail, in white flares and a floaty paisley print top. And even after Lily\u2019s outburst the other night, she was smiling and chatting away with everyone else, wearing an emerald green crocheted dress.\n\n\n\u201cI think tonight might be the night, y\u2019know,\u201d James slurred, collapsing into the seat next to Remus like a sack of potatoes.\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Remus mused conversationally, \u201cAnd what makes you think that, Prancer?\u201d (He was running out of Father Christmas\u2019s reindeer; they were going to have to settle on one eventually).\n\n\n\u201cLook at her!\u201d James gushed, \u201cShe\u2019s obviously trying to get my attention.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nLook\n\n\nat her!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Remus patted his friend\u2019s knee indulgently, \u201cYeah, I definitely see it. She\u2019s mad for you, mate.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI just need to work out how to impress her\u2026\u201d James downed the remains of his whisky. Remus didn\u2019t know how many that made - but it wasn\u2019t his job to babysit anyone.\n\n\n\u201cYou could try talking to her about Charms,\u201d Remus suggested, \u201cYou were struggling with that banishing incantation last week, and she nailed it on the first go.\u201d\n\n\nJames looked at him as if he was insane.\n\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll come up with something. Something to really wow her.\u201d\n\n\nHe got up and wandered away before Remus could try to tell him that Lily Evans probably did not want to be \u2018wowed\u2019. And anyway, he was distracted at that moment by Sirius, who had begun dancing with Mary to the final bars of the T.Rex song blaring out. Sirius often joked that the only kind of dancing he knew was ballroom - but here was evidence that that had been a lie. Remus looked away quickly, blushing.\n\n\n\u201cDrink, Remus?\u201d Marlene now landed beside him, taking James\u2019s place. She clutched a bottle of something greenish.\n\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWitches Brew,\u201d she smiled, pouring it into his cup. He sipped the fluorescent green liquid - it was very sweet, with a slight apple taste. Definitely alcoholic.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to make me so sick,\u201d he grinned.\n\n\n\u201cUgh, look at him,\u201d Marlene sighed, watching Sirius dancing, \u201cCould those jeans be any tighter?!\u201d\n\n\nRemus mumbled something into his cup, taking another gulp. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely going to go out with him again,\u201d Marlene said, \u201cMary always gets what Mary wants.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI thought you fancied James?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm, well they\u2019re both pretty gorgeous, to be honest. I swing back and forth. But Potter\u2019s so ga-ga for Lily it hardly seems worth it. Plus, I\u2019m on the quidditch team, aren\u2019t I? I\u2019d never hear the end of it if I went after the captain.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere are other boys,\u201d Remus said.\n\n\n\u201cNot like Sirius.\u201d She lay her head on his shoulder, dopily.\n\n\nHe finished his drink in one go and allowed her to pour him some more. He was getting a taste for it, whatever it was - Remus had always liked sweet things. The T.Rex song finally ended, and the next album spun itself out of its sleeve and fluttered onto the turntable.\n\n\n\nWishin' and hopin' and thinkin' and prayin'\n\n\n\n\nPlannin' and dreamin' each night of his charms...\n\n\n\n\nThat won't get you into his arms\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cOh god,\u201d Remus moaned, \u201cWho put Dusty Springfield in the pile?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI love this one!\u201d Marlene sat up, smiling.\n\n\nSure enough, the bouncy pop record had an amazing effect on every other girl at the party, as they all began to bop along to the tune, singing along loudly. Remus considered taking that moment to nip upstairs for a cheeky fag, but Marlene hoisted him to his feet,\n\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, darling, let\u2019s have a dance,\u201d She flung her arms around his neck, \u201cI\u2019ll pretend you\u2019re a tall handsome stranger, and you can pretend I\u2019m Raquel Welch or something.\u201d\n\n\n\nShow him that you care just for him\n\n\n\n\nDo the things he likes to do\n\n\n\n\nWear your hair just for him, 'cause\n\n\n\n\nYou won't get him\n\n\n\n\nThinkin' and a-prayin', wishin' and a-hopin'...\n\n\n\nRemus was unsteady on his feet at the best of times, but after mixing drinks all evening, and with Marlene hanging off him, giggling and swinging him about, it was all he could do to cling on for dear life.\n\n\n\u201cYes, Moony!\u201d Sirius crowded, as he and Mary moved closer to them, \u201cI never knew you could dance!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m the next Fred Astaire,\u201d Remus raised an ironic eyebrow, holding Marlene\u2019s hand over her head as she twirled around, then struggled to regain her balance.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a sweet couple,\u201d Mary said, leaning into Sirius. Remus shook his head, snorting with laughter.\n\n\n\nSo if you're thinkin' of how great true love is\n\n\n\n\nAll you gotta do is hold him and kiss him and squeeze him and love him\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cOi, Evans!\u201d James had remerged, apparently ready to enact his plan. The whole room turned to look at him, standing on top of one of the study tables with his broom held aloft.\n\n\n\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d Remus breathed.\n\n\n\u201cOh yes!\u201d Sirius cheered.\n\n\n\u201cPOTTER!\u201d Lily Evans shouted, \u201cGet DOWN from there, you\u2019ll hurt yourself!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWatch this!\u201d James cried, gleefully, thrilled by the attention. He leapt onto his broom and soared upwards at an astonishing rate.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never fallen off before,\u201d Marlene said, uncertainly, as James began the first of a series of loops and dives, each shakier than the last.\n\n\n\u201cHas he ever been drunk before, though?\u201d Mary countered.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine!\u201d Sirius laughed. They all watched as James flew around and around the rafters, faster and faster, until Remus\u2019s neck hurt and he was in danger of whiplash.\n\n\nEvidently, Lily had had enough too.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nPetrificus Totalus\n\n\n!\u201d She commanded, pointing her wand at James. He stopped at once, freezing in mid-air, but Lily was incredibly deft and switched seamlessly to a levitation charm, lowering him slowly to the ground. She set him down on the carpet, and stood over him, hands on her hips.\n\n\nHe blinked up at her, unable to speak, but full of plain adoration.\n\n\n\u201cYou idiot.\u201d She said. \u201cTen points from Gryffindor, and a weeks detention!\u201d And with that, she left him on the carpet and returned to her friends.\n\n\nRemus un-petrified James and helped him to his feet, handing him another whisky. The music had slowed down now, it sounded like Fairport Convention.\n\n\n\u201cTough luck, mate,\u201d he said, trying to sound sympathetic.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d James grinned back, slightly dazed but no worse for wear, \u201cDidn\u2019t you see how she looked at me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 yeah\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSmitten.\u201d He murmured, staggering backwards slightly, until Remus guided him into an armchair. \u201cTotally smitten.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDrink your drink, James.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCheers Moony, you\u2019re the best.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Remus replied, watching Mary wrap her arms around Sirius\u2019s neck and lay her head against his chest as they danced slowly. \u201cI\u2019m the best.\u201d"

            "content": "Thursday 18th December 1975\n\u201cI\u2019d like that essay back in January\u2026 yes, Mr Pettigrew, that is in addition to the one on the pitfalls of the\nGemino\ncurse.\u201d McGonagall gave a thin smile that was anything but sympathetic.\nPeter looked pretty dreadful, but the whole class felt it. Their workload had grown so enormous in the run up to Christmas that Sirius had had to perform a shrinking charm on his books, notes and papers just to fit them all under his bed. Remus felt that this was only a short-term solution - if Sirius actually took everything out and organised it for once, he\u2019d have no problem fitting it all neatly on his assigned shelves. Remus, who had never really owned enough things to make a mess with them, hated untidiness. Some nights he thought that the state of Sirius\u2019s bed was even more distracting than the boy sleeping in it.\nMarlene was particularly distressed as they left the classroom for Potions.\n\u201cI just can\u2019t work out the duplication part, it\u2019s so confusing!\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s an easy way to get the pronunciation right,\u201d Remus said, struggling with his heavy bag again. His shoulders were very sore this week in the run up to the moon. \u201cI can show you before we leave for Christmas if you want.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes please!\u201d Marlene nodded gratefully, \u201cYou make everything easy to understand. Tonight?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t tonight,\u201d he said, smoothly, \u201cFriday?\u201d\n\u201cOh, ok\u2026 I\u2019ll have to get all my packing done tonight though. Still got presents to wrap for mum and Danny.\u201d\nThis year, Remus had neatly wrapped every one of his Christmas gifts the moment he\u2019d bought them, too excited to wait. Now he was looking forward to two uninterrupted weeks at the Potter\u2019s with Peter and James.\nSirius had been summoned home in a howler earlier in the term. Remus was conflicted about this; of course he was deeply concerned for his friend, who was sure to have a terrible time. But on the other hand, two weeks without Sirius taking up all the air in the room would be a welcome relief for Remus, whose willpower was starting to fail.\nFor example, just now, as he stood outside the dungeon entrance chatting to Marlene, it was taking every ounce of his energy not to stare directly over her shoulder, to where Mary and Sirius were locked in a very passionate embrace, which was bordering on obscene.\nThey had been like that since Sirius\u2019s birthday; every moment in each other\u2019s company seemed to be spent tongue wrestling - much to James\u2019s disgust.\n\u201cEvans, can\u2019t you stop them?\u201d He asked, leaning against the wall, put out. \u201cI want my friend back.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the rules about displays of affection, Potter,\u201d Lily said, grimacing, \u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019ve checked?\u201d\nFortunately, at that moment, Slughorn opened the door to his classroom and Remus hurried inside. He and Lily shared a desk at the front of the room, so at least he didn\u2019t have to see Sirius and Mary making eyes at each other all lesson. The only saving grace was that at least Sirius didn\u2019t talk about her when she wasn\u2019t there - like Peter did with Desdemona, or James with Lily. Remus had begun looking forward to late nights in their dorm room, when he could pretend nothing at all had changed.\nPotions was dull, as usual. Remus had plans to drop the subject as soon as he could after OWLs were finished with - he would pass by the skin of his teeth, if at all, and only thanks to Lily.\nSlughorn gave them yet another assignment due in January.\n\u201cAt this rate I\u2019ll be writing essays during Christmas dinner,\u201d Lily sighed as they packed away their things. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for OWLs to be over, can you?\u201d\n\u201cI s\u2019pose we\u2019ll just have to start work on NEWTs once these are finished,\u201d Remus replied pessimistically. \u201cAnd Dirk Cresswell told me we won\u2019t get our OWL results until the end of the summer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! Oh no, that\u2019s going to ruin my holiday. Dad wants to take us all down to Cornwall in the caravan and I was really looking forward to it.\u201d\nRemus nodded, gravely. Even though it was not yet Christmas, he had been looking forward to the summer holidays too. Two long, warm, simple months with Grant sounded like utter bliss. He\u2019d written Grant a Christmas card, but hadn\u2019t made his mind up whether or not to send it. There was nothing interesting inside - just a standard festive greeting - but he was shy about it. Grant might think it was silly. Remus had been carrying it around in his book bag for a week.\n\u201cSo, what are you up to tonight?\u201d Lily asked, as they left the classroom on their way to lunch.\n\u201cHmm? Nothing.\u201d\n\u201cI heard you tell Marlene you were busy, and we\u2019re not on the rota for patrol tonight\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, er\u2026 it\u2019s something else. Detention.\u201d\n\u201cRemus, you never get detention,\u201d Lily laughed, \u201cCome on, what is it? A prank? A secret affair?\u201d\nRemus gave a mysterious smile, which he hoped was something like Sirius and James\u2019s -\n\u201cAsk me no questions and I shall tell you no lies.\u201d\n\u201cJust try not to break any laws,\u201d she grinned back, elbowing him gently.\nRemus tutted, as if he would never consider such a thing. Really, it was James, Sirius and Peter who were breaking the law. He was just an innocent werewolf bystander.\n\u201cEvans, Moony.\u201d James joined them as they reached the Great Hall. \u00a0\u201cMay I join you for lunch, as you are the only two people in my life not currently snogging?\u201d\n\u201cOi, what am I, scotch mist?\u201d Marlene nudged him as they sat down.\n\u201cMy apologies, McKinnon,\u201d James bowed graciously, \u201cI thank you for maintaining your decorum. Unlike some I could mention.\u201d He balled up serviette and threw it at Sirius\u2019s head. \u201cLovebirds! Get a bloody room, we\u2019re trying to eat!\u201d\nIt had no effect.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty brave of her, snogging him all over the castle like that.\u201d Marlene mused, \u201cOr brave of him, I\u2019m not sure. Either way, a pureblood and a muggleborn, flaunting their relationship--\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Lily said, bristling like an angry cat, \u201cMary is every bit as good as Sirius Black. Blood status has nothing to do with it.\u201d\n\u201cWell obviously\nI\nknow that.\u201d Marlene said, defensively, \u201cBut\u2026 well, see for yourself.\u201d She glanced over at the Slytherin table.\nA number of Slytherins, Regulus among them, was watching the excessive display of affection taking place on the Gryffindor table. As a muggleborn, Mary had been a target for most of her school career, but it was clear that the disapproval had amped up since she had started going out with the heir to one of the oldest pureblood families in Britain.\nIt was deeply unnerving, the way they were all staring like that; narrow eyes and clenched fists. All of them except Snape - who was watching Remus.\n\u201cBloody hell.\u201d James muttered. \u201cBunch of weirdos.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about her.\u201d Marlene bit her lip. \u201cIf she gets cornered in the halls and Sirius isn\u2019t there\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll look out for her.\u201d James said, gallantly. He looked at Remus and Lily, \u201cRight?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Remus nodded at once.\n\u201cEr\u2026 yeah,\u201d Lily said, more slowly. She had a funny look on her face, as James caught her eye. As if she had seen something which surprised her. \u201cObviously. We all care about Mary, we won\u2019t let anything happen.\u201d\n* * *\n\u201cHe\u2019s late.\u201d Remus grumbled, wrapping his arms around himself and pacing. \u201cHe\u2019s off snogging MacDonald, he\u2019s not coming.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be here, Moony, give him a minute.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t\nhave\na minute!\u201d Remus snapped. His nerves were raw, he didn\u2019t have the patience to be polite. \u201cI need to go and see Madam Pomfrey\nnow\n.\u201d\n\u201cOk, well you go, we\u2019ll follow,\u201d James said, \u201cIf Black doesn\u2019t show up then me and Pete\u2019ll come by ourselves. It\u2019ll still work, I\u2019m big enough to control you.\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t like the idea of that, but he was in too bad of a mood. He was just about to storm out of the room when the door swung open, almost hitting him in the face,\n\u201cOops, sorry I\u2019m late!\u201d Sirius said. His hair was out of place and his cheeks were pinkish. Remus regarded him with disgust,\n\u201cI have to go.\u201d He said, through gritted teeth.\n\u201cYeah, I know, I\u2019m really sorry, Moony.\u201d Sirius tried a charming smile. \u201cI was just with Mary, and--\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got time for this!\u201d Remus left at once, marching purposefully down the stairs. Any time of the month - any time at all, other than the full moon - and Remus could keep all the plates spinning; his desire for Sirius, his jealousy of Mary, his loneliness for someone to talk to. Just now it was all a bit too much.\nHe barely spoke to Madam Pomfrey all the way to the shack, and once they were halfway there he realised he could smell his friends - all three - following them under the invisibility cloak. Trying hard to shake off his temper and appear calm, he re-focussed his thoughts on Christmas with the Potters; the scent of clove and orange, the thick juicy currants in Mrs Potter\u2019s fruit cake, velvety white royal icing, the warmth of the fireplace. He felt a lot better, by the time Madam Pomfrey was locking him in.\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Moony,\u201d a voice said, moments before Sirius, James and Peter appeared as if out of nowhere. Sirius stepped forward guiltily, \u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Remus shrugged, hearing the click in his joints as he did so. \u201cYou made it in time. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cTell you what,\u201d Sirius grinned at them all, \u201cSnogging\u2019s really moreish, once you get the hang of it.\u201d\nJames and Peter laughed. Remus smiled as politely as he could. He desperately wished he could tell them all the truth - that he wasn\u2019t the priggish, inexperienced boy they thought he was; that actually he knew\nexactly\nhow much fun it was to be kissed for hours - the impossible intimacy of having someone to cling to. More than that, he knew how it felt when it was gone.\n\u201cWhere does she think you are now?\u201d James asked Sirius,\n\u201cDetention, obviously. Got to maintain my bad boy persona.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you do, Snuffles.\u201d\n\u201cOh piss off, Buckeroo.\u201d\nRemus closed his eyes as pain shot through his body. He bit his lip and rolled back on the bed,\n\u201cBetter change,\u201d he said to his friends, \u201cSee you in a bit.\u201d\n* * *\nFriday 19th December 1975\n\u201cBloody hell, Moony, I\u2019m really not a fan of that bit.\u201d Sirius was saying softly, guiding Remus back into his bed.\n\u201cMm, not my favourite part either.\u201d Remus responded, wincing against the morning light. \u201cSorry, it must be crap to watch.\u201d\nHe\u2019d dislocated a shoulder again. What would happen when he finished school and Madam Pomfrey couldn\u2019t fix him anymore? Would he have to go to a hospital? Were there wizard hospitals?\n\u201cIt was good though,\u201d James was saying, somewhere else in the room, \u201cYou\u2019re trusting us more and more.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius agreed, \u201cI reckon in the new year we can try leaving this place\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cStart exploring - there\u2019s acres and acres of forest out there to explore, Moony. You deserve it.\u201d\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Remus couldn\u2019t think straight, he was too tired, too sore.\n\u201cSee you later,\u201d James whispered, just as Remus fell asleep.\nWhen he woke up, he was already in a hospital bed, his arm was mended, and he felt as fit as a fiddle. What was more - it was the very last day of term, and tomorrow he would be boarding the Hogwarts Express back to London, then off to the Potters. He smiled to himself. He could not remember having been so happy in a very long time. When had he ever woken up from a full moon without a new scar? When had he ever had a Christmas to look forward to with a loving family? He might even have a go on James\u2019s old broom, if someone bribed him with a bit of chocolate.\n\u201cGood afternoon, Mr Lupin,\u201d Madam Pomfrey called out. She must have some kind of sixth sense; she always knew when he was awake.\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d he called back, with a mild croak. He and Sirius had been howling together, he remembered. It had been a lovely thing - like singing.\n\u201cAnother very good night!\u201d The medi-witch approached his bed, \u201cI\u2019ll fetch you some lunch, but then you\u2019re free to go. Merry Christmas, my dear.\u201d\n\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d he smiled up at her. He would leave her gift behind on the bed - he was too shy to hand it over in person."

            "content": "Saturday 20th December 1975\n\u201cI will literally curse you both with a lip locking charm if you plan to do that all the way to London.\u201d Lily said, raising her wand to Sirius and Mary. Her deadpan expression was very hard to read, and the couple quickly disentangled. Mary stuck out her tongue, cheekily.\n\u201cYou too, Wormy!\u201d James held up his own wand, grinning at Lily like a lunatic.\nPeter and Desdemona moved apart too, smiling sheepishly.\nThe carriage was extremely cramped. Remus was squashed up against the window next to James, with Sirius and Mary by the door. On the opposite row of seats, Lily and Marlene were squeezed in beside Peter and Desdemona.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just saying goodbye,\u201d Mary smirked, laying her head on Sirius\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only two weeks, and you can write to each other.\u201d Lily replied, smartly.\n\u201cEr\u2026 actually, better if none of you write to me.\u201d Sirius said. \u201cI\u2019m not likely to get the letters anyway, and unless you want my dear mother reading them\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the mirror, though?\u201d James said, seriously, \u201cYou can still get in touch with us if you need to?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, \u2018course.\u201d Sirius smiled at him, reassuringly, patting his breast jacket pocket.\nRemus stared out of the window, pressing his forehead on the cold glass. The train moved sluggishly down to London. They passed the phone box he had used to call Grant and he felt a pang of guilt for not phoning again since then. He had been so busy with everything else in the end that he hadn\u2019t even sent the Christmas card. Grant was supposed to be studying at the local secondary modern, but at sixteen he could leave whenever he wanted. Remus tried to convince him over the summer to finish his CSE\u2019s, even maybe take a GCE if he could, but Grant had just laughed at him, as if education was one of Remus\u2019s peculiar eccentricities.\nMatron usually got the St Edmund\u2019s boys apprenticeships where they showed aptitude for handiwork, but Remus couldn\u2019t remember Grant ever mentioning the things he was good at - only the things he struggled with like Maths and English. And Remus couldn\u2019t very well tell Grant any of his best subjects, could he? The boys who didn\u2019t get apprenticeships had to find their own way, once they turned eighteen. Remus wasn\u2019t sure--\n\u201cOi, Moony, wakey wakey!\u201d Sirius barked, wrenching Remus out of his daydream, \u201cTrolley\u2019s here, don\u2019t want to miss your lunch, do you?\u201d\n\u201cOh, cheers,\u201d Remus turned back into the noisy, over warm carriage, where James was buying at least twelve pasties on top of all the sweets they could manage.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll never get through all of this!\u201d Lily scolded, smiling slightly.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve clearly never seen Moony eat,\u201d James winked.\n\u201cOooh, I wish I had your metabolism, Remus!\u201d Desdemona said. \u201cMy mother\u2019s always telling me I ought to start dieting.\u201d\n\u201cNothing wrong with having curves,\u201d Mary said, taking a huge bite out of her own pasty. \u201cGives \u2018em something to hold on to!\u201d\nThe girls all giggled, even Lily, who was blushing hard. Remus wished the journey would be over soon.\nOf course, as the train pulled into King\u2019s Cross, he felt a horrible twist to his insides as Sirius fell quiet, his face pinched and pale. The girls and Peter all hurried to gather their things, eager to meet their families on the platform. Remus and James were deliberately slow, waiting until Mary had finally left the car, then helping Sirius with his own bags.\n\u201cCheck in every evening, right?\u201d James gripped his best friend\u2019s shoulder, \u201cIf I don\u2019t hear from you I\u2019m sending help.\u201d\nSirius grinned gratefully.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Nothing I haven\u2019t done before.\u201d\n\u201cPlease be careful!\u201d Remus burst out, \u201cKeep your head down, don\u2019t be so\u2026 so\u2026\nyou\n!\u201d\nSirius laughed.\n\u201cSound advice, Moony.\u201d\nRemus lowered his gaze, smiling bashfully. He wanted to hug him, but it was too late. Regulus was standing in the open doorway, arms folded.\n\u201cReady?\u201d\nSirius nodded, and did not turn back. James and Remus watched the brothers leave. They were almost the same height now. Regulus had a slimmer build, perhaps, but from behind they could be twins.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be ok.\u201d James said, and Remus instinctively knew that he was reassuring himself, more than anything else. After a moment, James was back to normal. He grabbed his suitcase handle (and Remus\u2019s too, without a word) and exhaled, \u201cC\u2019mon then, Moony - let\u2019s do Christmas!\u201d\n* * *\nWednesday 24th December 1975\nIt did not snow over Christmas of 1975 either - fortunately, nor did it rain, which meant (to James, anyway) that conditions were perfect for lots and lots of quidditch practice. Remus gave in and did as he was instructed. It took both their minds off Sirius. Remus was never going to be any great shakes at flying, but after the first three days in the air he at least wasn\u2019t terrified of falling any more. He even managed to get a quaffle past Peter once.\nBetween drills, the boys enjoyed all of the festive trimmings Remus had come to expect from a typical Potter Christmas; tinsel, lights, wrapping paper, late nights eating buttered teacakes, hearty dinners and bright mornings. Mr and Mrs Potter were as delightful as ever - though it was evident that their ongoing involvement in Dumbledore\u2019s resistance movement was taking its toll.\nMr Potter didn\u2019t join them outside as much, but locked himself in his study. When he emerged he moved stiffly, his back bent; no longer the sprightly mischief maker he had been only three short years ago. Mrs Potter, who was still everything a mother ought to be, had more silver hair than Remus remembered, and dark rings under her eyes. She still always had a smile for her boys, when they came in from the cold.\n\u201cJames, go and get your father, it\u2019s time for supper - have you spoken to Sirius today? Send him our love, will you dear? Remus! You look frozen through, go and stand by the fire for a bit and warm up\u2026 I\u2019ve put out an extra chop for you so make sure you eat it. I don\u2019t know how you boys keep growing the way you do\u2026 Hello, Peter love, staying for tea? Make sure your mother knows\u2026\u201d\nThey were speaking to Sirius as much as possible. Every night Remus and James would kneel on James\u2019s bed with the mirror lying open between them and wait for their friend to appear. It was always an immense relief when he did - those wicked blue eyes and cheeky grin, promising them he was ok.\n\u201cReg\u2019s being a complete prat, as usual, and mother is an eternal delight, but nothing out of the ordinary.\u201d\nThe trouble was, Remus thought, pursing his lips, neither he nor James really understood what \u2019ordinary\u2019 meant in the Black household. So, there was no way of knowing how much danger Sirius was in.\n\u201cCan\u2019t say much,\u201d Sirius would whisper, after his brief updates, \u201cAnyone could be listening. Bloody portraits are spies here.\u201d He looked tired.\n\u201cWish we could just go and get him.\u201d James would say, hopelessly.\n\u201cMe too.\u201d Remus nodded along. Every night the same.\nThe final night they heard from Sirius was the night before Christmas Eve (\nwas that the eve of Christmas Eve?\n, Remus found himself thinking childishly. Something Grant might say, to make Remus laugh.) The irony of it all, was that on that night, the 23rd of December 1975, Sirius was in high spirits. In fact, Remus might go so far as to say he sounded\npositive\n. Optimistic.\n\u201cThey\u2019re being ok today, actually,\u201d he smiled up through the compact mirror, \u201cActually sort of\u2026 nice. Friendly. Dad smiled at me. I dunno if dad has ever smiled at me. They keep talking about moving past our problems as a family\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d James smiled back, encouraging, \u201cMaybe the war has knocked some sense into them.\u201d\n\u201cTraditional Christmas Eve dinner tomorrow night,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cAll the Blacks in one place - joy. I should be able to get away for our usual time, just don\u2019t laugh at my stupid dress robes, ok?\u201d\nJames and Remus smiled, and promised not to laugh. They went to bed that night feeling reassured; looking forward to their own Christmas Eve plans.\nThese plans of course involved more quidditch practice - but thankfully only an hour of it. Afterwards Mrs Potter called them in and requested that they fetch the nice china down from the attic, along with the big Christmas tablecloth,\n\u201cWith everything going on I\u2019m so behind this year\u2026\u201d she murmured, stirring a bowl of mincemeat ready for pies. Remus noticed that her fingernails were bitten down to the quick.\n\u201cHave we got many people coming this year, mum?\u201d James asked, as he carefully unloaded the box of china plates and bowls, handing them to Remus for a quick rinse under the tap.\n\u201cMm\u2026 well, Darius, of course, he\u2019ll always show up for a hot dinner if one\u2019s on offer.\u201d\nRemus scowled, but said nothing. Mrs Potter continued, \u201cI invited the Bones\u2019s and the Tonks\u2019s\u2026 but everyone seems to want to keep to themselves this year. The Pettigrews will be over, I imagine. Perhaps some people from the ministry, your father\u2019s friends\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDumbledore?\u201d\n\u201cNo, dear, he\u2019ll be busy.\u201d\nRemus was glad of this. Dumbledore was so serious these days, and his name always seemed to be spoken with a sense of dread. He brought bad news. The Potters were such nice people, why couldn\u2019t they invite nice teachers, like Professor Flitwick, or even Professor Ferox? Though, Remus mused, as he wiped down a large serving dish, he was probably just plain old\nMr\nFerox now. Or Leo - that was his given name, according to Mary. Leo Ferox. Sirius Black. Maybe Remus just had a thing for cool names.\nAfter dinner, James and Remus convened on James\u2019s bed once again at their usual time for their appointment with Sirius. But when James opened the mirror, nothing appeared - only their own reflections.\n\u201cHe had that dinner,\u201d Remus said, though it didn\u2019t feel right. \u201cHe might be late.\u201d\nSo they waited. After half an hour, most of which they spent in anxious silence, James tried speaking softly into the mirror.\n\u201cSirius?\u201d He called, \u201cAre you there?\u201d\nNothing.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d James said. Remus didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d James got up, \u201cI\u2019m telling dad.\u201d\nMr Potter frowned when he heard, but wasn\u2019t much help.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t jump to any conclusions, James. You said all was well, yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to Black family banquets before,\u201d Mr Potter said, thoughtfully, \u201cThey run on late - especially if Orion is presiding. Man likes to hear himself speak. Not unlike Sirius.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll wait up a bit longer,\u201d Mrs Potter said, smoothing down her son\u2019s hair lovingly, \u201cLet\u2019s have some tea, eh? Come and sit by the fire.\u201d\nThey did. Gully the house elf came in with the tea tray, laden with the steaming pot and a plate of biscuits too, but neither James nor Remus was in the mood to eat. The hour grew later and later - the Potters had a grandfather clock in the hall, and Remus could hear it ticking away mercilessly. The compact mirror lay open in James\u2019s lap, reflecting only the flickering orange of the fireplace.\nEven James\u2019s parents looked nervous now. Mr Potter got up a few times and paced. Mrs Potter kept bustling about the room; straightening the ornaments on the mantelpiece or rearranging the brightly packaged presents under the tree.\nAt eleven o\u2019clock, an owl came screeching out of the black night, towards the living room window, and it was only Mrs Potter\u2019s quick thinking and speedy wand work that stopped it from shattering the glass. It was a huge, stately eagle owl - the same kind the Blacks used. It wailed, agitated and clearly exhausted from its journey. James wrested the note from its leg and tore it open. His eyes widened and he let out a strange, strangled noise. Remus jumped up to read over his shoulder.\n\nHe\u2019s in trouble. Please help. R.A.B.\n\n\u201cEffie, send for Dumbledore at once.\u201d Mr Potter said, joining Remus at James\u2019s side.\nRemus began to tremble. He had never known terror like it. He wanted to scream, shout - hit something. James was the same, he could tell - he\u2019d turned white as a sheet, reading the note over and over.\n\u201cWe need to go,\u201d James said, his voice broken, \u201cWe need to go and get him now.\u201d\n\u201cWe will,\u201d Mr Potter said, \u201cJust stay calm.\u201d\nRemus laughed. It was hugely inappropriate, but no one seemed to notice.\nStay calm\n.\nThere was no time for anything else. The fireplace crackled loudly, then blazed bright emerald green. Mr Potter put his arms around both boys and pulled them back sharply. A chaos of noise and shouts echoed through the chimney flue from another fireplace, in another house. The body of Sirius Black tumbled out of the flames and onto the carpet at their feet."

            "content": "Remus, James and Mr Potter ran forward at once. Remus collapsed to his knees, reaching Sirius first. He was lying face down, black hair pouring like blood on the red carpet. Remus didn\u2019t even think, just rolled him over. His face was pale, his eyes were closed, but he was alive. Yes, Remus could hear Sirius\u2019s heart, pounding hard behind his ribs. He could smell the stink of fear, mixed with adrenaline.\n\u201cSirius?!\u201d James was there too, pressing his head to Sirius\u2019s chest to listen,\n\u201cHe\u2019s alive.\u201d Remus said, his voicing sounding strange. He was clutching Sirius\u2019s shoulders still, where he had turned him, he couldn\u2019t let go, his hands fisting the fine velvet dress robes.\n\u201cEffie!\u201d Mr Potter was shouting, \u201cQuickly!\u201d He bent over Sirius, \u201cStand back, boys, give him some air\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMmm.\u201d Sirius stirred, slightly, his eyelashes fluttered, but nothing more.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d Remus asked the room, desperately. Mr Potter was guiding him away, he had to let go. He crawled backwards, crab-like as Mrs Potter rushed in. He knew his legs wouldn\u2019t stand, just yet.\nEuphemia Potter was on the carpet in seconds, pulling Sirius\u2019s head into her lap. He must have made another noise, because she started whispering to him, sweet, small things;\n\u201cShhh now, love, I\u2019m here, you\u2019re safe, shhh\u2026\u201d\nRemus felt his eyes well up, drew his legs up under his chin and wrapped his arms around them. What was happening? He looked over at James, sitting opposite him on the living room floor, just as shocked, just as frightened. There was a distant *CRACK* outside, and Mr Potter left the room, returning moments later with Dumbledore. He seemed to bring the cold in with him; Remus felt the chill settle into his bones despite the fire which continued to blaze.\n\u201cMoody\u2019s outside,\u201d the old man said to James\u2019s father, \u201cProtective charms, everything in his arsenal. No one else will be coming here tonight.\u201d\nGood\n. Remus thought.\nGood\n.\nLock us all up in here, never let anyone near him again.\n\u201cHow is he, Effie?\u201d Dumbledore stood over Mrs Potter, who was still cradling Sirius. She was performing some kind of magic, her eyes closed, wand running over the unconscious boy\u2019s body, her lips were moving fast without making a sound. She eventually looked up, more shaken than Remus had ever seen her, fiery rage in her eyes.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll live.\u201d She said. \u201cHe needs rest.\u201d\n\u201cWas it\u2026?\u201d Mr Potter looked nervous. Mrs Potter closed her eyes again, and nodded.\n\u201c\nCruciatus\n.\u201d\nJames\u2019s covered his face with his hands. Remus just felt empty - as if everything that had ever made any kind of sense to him had been wrung out. The torture curse.\n\u201cBoys.\u201d Mr Potter suddenly said, sharply, looking at James, then Remus, \u201cI know you want to stay, but we need you to go to bed, just now. There\u2019s nothing you can do for Sirius at the moment.\u201d\n\u201cBut dad!\u201d James started, climbing shakily to his feet. There were tears in his eyes too.\n\u201cJames!\u201d Mrs Potter said, from the floor. \u201cNo. Bed.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t shout, but every man in the room seemed to shrink, slightly. There was no question of disobeying her.\nRemus wasn\u2019t sure how he got up, whether Dumbledore helped him, or whether he did it himself. Nor was he sure how he left the room that Sirius was in. It seemed like hours later that he was standing on the first floor landing, with James. Gully was lighting candles throughout the house, moving silently. The portraits along the staircases were sleeping. James held open his bedroom door, and Remus went inside without a word.\nThey lay on the bed, side by side, over the covers still in their clothes. They had been sitting on the same bed only two or three hours before, waiting for Sirius to tell them he was ok. In the dark, James and Remus collected themselves, giving each other the time they needed.\nJames broke the quiet, of course.\n\u201cHe\u2019s here now.\u201d He said, tonelessly. \u201cHe\u2019s here now, and mum won\u2019t ever let him go back, I know it.\u201d\nRemus nodded, because there weren\u2019t any words. He didn\u2019t know if James saw; they were both staring straight up. His mind was racing, and he said the first thing that felt like a coherent thought,\n\u201cIs that what happens? With that curse?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never seen it.\u201d\n\u201cNo, of course.\u201d\n\u201cMum used to be a healer. If anyone can help him\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd Dumbledore\u2019s here.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, exactly.\u201d\n\u201cIf he\u2019s\u2026\u201d Remus\u2019s voice cracked, and he stopped talking.\n\u201cI know, mate.\u201d James whispered.\nThey did not speak again until the morning.\n* * *\nChristmas Day 1975\nRemus couldn\u2019t believe he had fallen asleep. He cursed himself for being so thoughtless, so selfish.\nYou\u2019ve no right to him\nhe told himself angrily as he sat up, climbing off James\u2019s huge, comfortable four poster bed,\nyou\u2019ve no right to call yourself his friend at all, if you can\u2019t even stay awake when he\u2019s\u2026\nhe didn\u2019t know how Sirius was.\nHe left James still sleeping, and went to the bathroom. It was morning; the curtains has been drawn, presumably by Gully, and watery winter daylight filled the stairwell. The house was very quiet, no one else was awake yet. There was no usual smell of breakfast cooking or tea brewing on the hob. After he\u2019d been to the loo and had a quick wash, Remus stood awkwardly in the hall.\nHe didn\u2019t want to go back into James\u2019s room; that seemed a bit weird, especially when he had his own things all laid out in one of the guest rooms. Sirius was in the room at the end of the hall, Remus could smell him. Mrs Potter was in there too. He didn\u2019t know where Mr Potter was.\n\u201cMaster Lupin,\u201d a squeaky voice startled him from the stairs. It was Gully, his big brown eyes full of innocent concern, \u201cIs you wanting breakfast, Master Lupin?\u201d\nRemus shook his head,\n\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d\n\u201cTis a terrible thing. Terrible bad thing.\u201d The wizened little creature shook its head sadly, ears wilting like a sorry puppy.\n\u201cYes. Terrible.\u201d Remus sat on the stairs, glad for someone to talk to.\n\u201cI\u2019m telling my mistress, and my master, we\u2019s got to be careful; we\u2019s got to protect our own. Gully is thinking we should go into hiding, Gully knows lots of families going into hiding now.\u201d Gully\u2019s brow creased, as if he was trying to remember something exactly right, \u201cBut my mistress is saying to me, \u2018Gully, we is responsible. We is a good, lucky family and we has many good things.\u2019 Mistress tells me we needs to be looking after everyone we can. She says if we don\u2019t, we is having nothing worth protecting at all.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t do a very good job of protecting Sirius.\u201d Remus scuffed the carpet angrily with his toe.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Gully shook his big round head again, \u201cAlways, in war, there is people getting hurt.\u201d\nRemus bit his lip. Behind them, a door opened,\n\u201cGully?\u201d The weak voice of Mrs Potter came, \u201cWill you come and sit with Sirius while I -- oh, hello, Remus, dear.\u201d\nShe had been up all night, that was clear, but she still had a smile for him.\n\u201cIs he ok?\u201d Remus stood up.\n\u201cNo lasting damage,\u201d she croaked, her smile waning slightly, \u201cNot on the outside, anyway. He\u2019s sleeping still, just a mild dose of potion. Would you like to sit with him? I need a little lie down before Monty gets home.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah of course,\u201d Remus started forward, eager to help in any way he could. He crossed the landing quickly, and slipped into the room.\n\u201cSend Gully to wake me as soon as he opens his eyes,\u201d Euphemia said, patting his shoulder gently, \u201cDumbledore will want to speak to him. He wanted to last night, but I wouldn\u2019t let him. Poor lamb.\u201d\n\u201cHe was conscious, then? Last night?\u201d\n\u201cYes. For a little while,\u201d Euphemia sighed, deeply, hollow with exhaustion, \u201cBut he was in no fit state for an interrogation.\u201d\nRemus nodded, dumbly.\nShe closed the door behind her. The room was dark, but that was ok. Remus could see in the dark; often he liked it.\nThe figure lying in the bed could not possibly be his friend, Sirius Black. Because Sirius Black never slept like that; facing up, hands by his side, covers neatly tucked over his chest. Sirius slept like a dog; all rumbled sheets and limbs akimbo, face down, arms thrown wide.\nRemus approached with caution. Was this how it was, he wondered, the morning after a full moon? Was this how it felt to see your friend torn apart? It was unbearable. He sat in the seat by the bedside, a squashy purple armchair with a book splayed open on one arm.\nUnforgivable: Caring for the Victims of Curses and Hexes\n. Remus closed the book, wondering whether Mrs Potter had needed to consult it many times before. There was a handkerchief underneath it, damp with tears - Remus could smell the salt. It must have been difficult for her - as a healer and a mother. Had she looked at this black haired boy and seen James? Had she wondered what kind of parent would do such a thing?\nHe sat in the quiet, listening to Sirius breathing. Stupidly, he thought of Grant, who could be no help at all, except that he probably would have hugged Remus, and Remus felt that a hug was the only thing he wanted in the world, just now. The church bells echoed up the hill from the village. It was Christmas Day.\n* * *\nJames came in and joined him, after an hour or so. He brought tea, and Remus accepted it gratefully. James raised his dark eyebrows at Remus, questioning, and Remus shook his head,\nno\n. James sat on the arm of the chair, and they did not speak.\nIt was another hour before Sirius so much as moved. A quiet stirring, then a flicker in his features, before his eyes eased open, heavy with sleep. It took him a moment to focus, and the room was still very gloomy. When he finally caught the shapes of James and Remus, his brow furrowed, then he cracked a smile,\n\u201cBloody hell,\u201d he said, hoarsely, \u201cWho died?\u201d\nJames laughed,\n\u201cWanker.\u201d\n\u201cTosspot.\u201d Sirius threw back.\n\u201cArse.\u201d\n\u201cOi,\u201d Sirius pushed himself up on his elbows, \u201cBe nice, I\u2019m an invalid you know.\u201d\n\u201cTell you what,\u201d James grinned, \u201cYou really know how to make an entrance.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s in my noble blood.\u201d Sirius smiled, then faltered, his eyes suddenly stricken. They all fell quiet again. \u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered, looking down.\n\u201cTea?\u201d\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u201cGully!\u201d James summoned the house elf, who was only too pleased to serve.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Sirius asked, the colour slowly returning to his cheeks, \u201cYou two been keeping a bedside vigil for me?\u201d\n\u201cActually, it\u2019s mum who was up all night.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah\u2026\u201d Sirius\u2019s face grew distant, closed off. \u201cI\u2019ll thank her, obviously. Say sorry for showing up like that\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d James shook his head, \u201cShe\u2019d do anything for you. She loves you.\u201d\nSirius\u2019s eyes filled with tears and he looked away. Fortunately, Gully reappeared at that moment with a tea tray laden with cups, saucers, toast, muffins, sausages, eggs (scrambled, fried and boiled), smoked salmon, kippers, and even cereal.\nNone of them ate very much. Remus was hungry \u2013 starving, actually, but everything tasted like plastic so in the end he just downed cup after cup of scalding tea - no milk, no sugar. He wasn\u2019t angry yet \u2013 anger was his usual response to feeling helpless, or sad, or in pain, but he felt like it might come later. Just now, he wanted to be whatever Sirius needed.\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, suddenly, \u201cI was supposed to get your mum, James - as soon as Sirius woke up.\u201d\n\u201cLet her sleep,\u201d Sirius said, resting back on his pillows.\n\u201cNo, she wanted me to, so that she could get Dumbledore.\u201d\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d James asked, perplexed. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine, now.\u201d\n\u201cHe wanted to ask some questions-\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Sirius said.\nJames and Remus both turned to look at Sirius, who had paled again, his eyes big and frightened. \u201cPlease,\u201d he said, \u201cNot yet, just\u2026 just let me have Christmas, ok? I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d\n\u201cOk mate, it\u2019s ok\u2026\u201d James said, softly, leaning over to pat Sirius\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe won\u2019t wake her up. You can pretend to be asleep, if you want. Anything you want.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Sirius relaxed back again. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cPfft.\u201d James blew his hair up from his forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas, isn\u2019t it?\u201d"

            "content": "No one was angry that they\u2019d tried to protect Sirius. Mrs Potter rose from her own bed when Mr Potter returned from wherever he\u2019d been, and they both agreed that Dumbledore was sure to arrive of his own accord, eventually, and anything he wanted to ask Sirius could wait until then.\nThey salvaged the rest of the morning as best they could. Mr Potter cheerfully offered to apparate all of the presents up to Sirius\u2019s bedroom, but Sirius wouldn\u2019t have it.\n\u201cMy legs work fine!\u201d He insisted, \u201cI want to come down and see the tree!\u201d\nSo, they all gathered themselves up and got dressed or changed, then reconvened half an hour later in the living room. Remus couldn\u2019t help staring at the patch of carpet where he had seen Sirius\u2019s body fall less than twelve hours previous. The pain was sharp and startling. He had to look at the current, conscious Sirius; bundled up in blankets with yet another mug of tea on the couch opposite him, just to feel normal again.\nThe unwrapping of gifts still felt as joyful and natural as ever. A free for all, no order to it, they simply tore at wrapping paper until they were surrounded by it, strips of brightly coloured debris. It didn\u2019t matter what anyone got, only the memory of having received something nice on that awful morning. The Potters, of course, had plenty ready for both Sirius and Remus, and they promised Sirius even more yet to come -\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get you some nice pictures, to brighten up your room,\u201d Mrs Potter said, \u201cWhich quidditch team do you support, sweetheart? Or perhaps one of those rock stars you kids like?\u201d\nSirius looked at her as if he\u2019d just received the most wonderful gift of his life. Perhaps he had.\n\u201cMost of my stuff\u2019s at Hogwarts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's just clothes at home\u2026\u201d He looked a bit embarrassed, and Remus knew he was also thinking about the rude posters he had permanently affixed to his bedroom walls. You could be sure he would not be doing that in his new room at the Potter\u2019s.\n\u201cWell, you can borrow some of James\u2019s things for a little while. Perhaps we\u2019ll go shopping in the new year.\u201d\nThey sat down to a quiet Christmas lunch. Evidently, someone had disinvited the guests that had been planned for \u2013 which to Remus was a blessing. He was already worm thin from too much worry and not enough sleep; he did not need Darius Barebones thrown into the mix. He did think of the Pettigrews, and wonder if Peter was worried, or feeling left out.\nGully was just about to set light to the Christmas pudding when the *CRACK* of apparition sounded outside the front gate. Dumbledore. Sirius jumped, and looked as if he wanted to get up from the table, but stayed put. Mr Potter smiled at them all reassuringly and went to the door.\nEveryone listened intently.\n\u201cAlbus! Merry Christmas,\u201d\n\u201cFleamont. I take it Sirius has had his rest?\u201d\n\u201cYes, we were just about to have--\u201d\n\u201cI did request that you contact me as soon as he woke up.\u201d\n\u201cCome in, Dumbledore. Join us for some pudding.\u201d\nDumbledore stalked into the room. He was wearing sombre robes in deep, brownish maroon, like dried blood. He looked as though his night had been just as long as theirs. He was followed in by a stocky man who resembled a rather grizzled bulldog. He had a mass of greyish-ginger hair, and mean dark eyes which darted furtively around the room, as if scouting for trouble.\n\u201cAlbus, Alastor,\u201d Mrs Potter got up, waving her wand. Two more chairs appeared at the dinner table, as well as small plates, forks, napkins and goblets. \u201cWon\u2019t you join us for pudding?\u201d\n\u201cNot now, Effie,\u201d The stocky man - Alastor - grunted, \u201cOn duty.\u201d\nShe gave him a look, not dissimilar to the look she had given James last night. He cleared his throat and sat down, quickly. Remus smirked. He had to find out exactly how she did that. Mothers had their own magic, it seemed. Dumbledore took his place with more decorum. His expression, as ever, was still as a millpond and impossible to read. He was looking at Sirius.\nThere it was, Remus felt it settle around him like an old friend. Rage. The desire to lunge across the table and shake Dumbledore senseless was so strong, and so tangible, that he found himself gripping the seat of his chair.\nThe stranger, Alastor, turned to look at him. Remus felt himself being scanned by those dark, perceptive eyes. Oh. He knew Remus was a werewolf - Remus wasn\u2019t sure how\nhe\nknew that Alastor knew, but he did. There was no question. Remus raised his chin and looked him in the eye. Alastor smiled, slightly, as if this had confirmed something he had hoped for, then turned back to Dumbledore.\n\u201cSirius,\u201d their head teacher said, quietly, \u201cHow are you?\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Sirius nodded, staring at the big dark pudding at the centre of the table. Gully snapped his fingers and it caught alight, the blue flame shimmering like strange magical vapour.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to discuss last night's events with you,\u201d Dumbledore pressed, \u201cI know it isn\u2019t pleasant, and you may wish to forget, but anything you tell me might be useful, do you understand?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Fine.\u201d Sirius nodded, expression unchanged.\nThe flame died, and Gully clicked his fingers again. The pudding divided neatly into eight portions. It was rich and moist and cloying, the fruit and brandy stuck in their throats. They ate quietly for a moment, before Mr Potter felt he had to speak.\n\u201cNot seeing your family today, Moody?\u201d\nAlastor shook his head.\n\u201cThe job comes first. I\u2019ll be here as long as you need me.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re very grateful.\u201d Mrs Potter said, the kindness returning to her tone.\n\u201cAlastor is an Auror,\u201d Mr Potter explained to the boys. Remus saw the light of recognition go on in James and Sirius\u2019s eyes, and made a mental note to enquire later. If he had to guess, he assumed it meant some kind of wizard bodyguard. He thought of Charles Bronson in\nDeath Wish\n, and imagined Alastor Moody with a gun.\nOnce pudding was eaten, they all returned to the living room. Sirius sat on the sofa, with James and Remus either side. They had sat in the same formation last Christmas, when Dumbledore had arrived to announce the deaths of the Frasers. Remus had not thought of the Frasers at all since then, not really \u2013 only as part of the ever-darkening backdrop of a war he would prefer not to worry about. He had so much else to distract him.\nOne of these distractions was sitting beside him, right now. Their knees knocked together occasionally; Sirius wouldn\u2019t sit still. Remus tried not to flinch away, in case it was misread.\n\u201cI hope this will not take long.\u201d Dumbledore smiled, pleasantly, as if this was nothing more than a friendly chat. \u201cSirius, we just need to know anything you can remember about the events which led to you arriving here at eleven fifteen last night.\u201d\n\u201cWas that the time?\u201d Sirius blinked, \u201cI thought it was later.\u201d\nDumbledore folded his hands in his lap and smiled.\n\u201cIn your own time, please.\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Sirius cleared his throat, and glanced at James, who smiled at him in a brotherly way. Sirius looked at Dumbledore again, \u201cI thought it would be ok. I never really got on with my family that well\u2026 since I\u2019m in Gryffindor, y\u2019know. But they were\u2026 I thought it would be ok. We have a family dinner every year on Christmas Eve \u2013 the\nwhole\nfamily.\u201d\n\u201cWho was there?\u201d Moody asked. He was taking notes, a quill hovered just at chest level, scribbling quickly onto a piece of floating parchment.\n\u201cAll of the Blacks,\u201d Sirius looked up at him, \u201cAnd the Lestranges. The Malfoys \u2013 Narcissa and her husband, anyway. Not Andromeda, obviously. The\u2026 the Goyles arrived later. And the Notts. The Crabbes. Barty Crouch was visiting, he\u2019s friends with my brother.\u201d\n\u201cCrouch?!\u201d Moody sounded surprised. Dumbledore smiled again, inclining his head,\n\u201cThat would be Bartimus Junior, of course.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius nodded. \u201cLittle git.\u201d\n\u201cQuite the gathering, eh Albus?\u201d Moody muttered.\n\u201cQuite. Please, Sirius, do go on.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026 yeah, it was all normal really. Normal for us. Dinner, dancing. Snobby stuff. They\u2026.\u201d He paused, looking ashamed, \u201cThey toasted to Voldemort. I didn\u2019t join in though, professor, I swear! It was sort of jokey, I don\u2019t even know how serious they were. Dad was a bit drunk.\u201d\nDumbledore\u2019s expression did not change. Sirius was looking at his feet now, and kept talking, faster and faster.\n\u201cI was s\u2019posed to talk to James at eight, so I tried to sort of sneak off. But my cousin - Bellatrix - she caught me, and cornered me in the library. She said as I was nearly of age, it was time I started taking my role as heir more seriously, leave my friends behind, and grow up. I told her to\u2026 well, I wasn\u2019t very nice. She called my parents, Reg came in too. And Crouch.\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t worried, because\u2026 well everyone knows Bella\u2019s a bit bonkers, so I thought they\u2019d just tell her to stay out of it. But they didn\u2019t; they sided with her. Dad said\u2026 he said he wanted me to make him proud for once. I told him I was trying, but. But... \u201c\nSirius paused for breath. The silence was agony. He continued.\n\u201cAnyway. They wanted me to swear allegiance to Voldemort. I thought they were joking. They were saying all this mad stuff, about muggleborns, and blood traitors, and\u2026 then Bellatrix showed me her arm \u2013 she\u2019s got this tattoo,\u201d he looked up, as if realising this piece of information was useful, \u201cIt\u2019s the dark mark, sir, the skull and snake. She said she\u2019s chosen a side, and it was time for me to choose mine. I said no. I said it so many times.\u201d He closed his eyes, looking down again.\n\u201cAnd they hurt you, for it?\u201d Dumbledore prompted, \u201cThey tried to persuade you?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cBellatrix did this?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cYour mother? Your father?\u201d\nSirius\u2019s breathing was very shallow, but he kept going. He nodded.\n\u201cThey took turns.\u201d\nMrs Potter stood up, suddenly, and left the room. Remus didn\u2019t blame her. His urge to hit something was reaching critical levels.\n\u201cBut you managed to escape?\u201d Dumbledore pushed, gently.\nSirius nodded again,\n\u201cAfter a while, I must have stopped saying no, because\u2026 well it just hurt too much, I couldn\u2019t say anything. They must have needed me to agree, because they left me there, they locked me in the library. But there\u2019s a fireplace there, and floo powder. I dunno, maybe they wanted me to go.\u201d He sounded very tired, now. But the story was told, and there was an air of relief.\n\u201cThank you, Sirius.\u201d Dumbledore said, very softly. \u201cThis has been a great help. I won\u2019t disrupt your Christmas any further.\u201d He stood, smoothly, and glanced at Mr Potter, \u201cYour offer to house Sirius until he comes of age still stands, I assume?\u201d\n\u201cAs much as it did when he was twelve.\u201d Mr Potter said, straightening his back. He was a head shorter than Dumbledore, but at that moment, Fleamont Potter was the tallest man in the room.\n\u201cExcellent.\u201d Dumbledore nodded. \u201cI shall see you boys in January, then.\u201d\n\u201cWait!\u201d Sirius jumped up, \u201cProfessor \u2013 what about my brother?\u201d\n\u201cDo you believe Regulus is in danger?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll hurt him. He\u2019s good at doing as he\u2019s told, he only wants to please our parents. But they\u2019ll make him join Voldemort, he\u2019ll get marked \u2013 he\u2019s sixteen next year, and\u2013\u201d\n\u201cDoes Regulus want to leave?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 no. Not like I did.\u201d\n\u201cThen we cannot force him. He is in no immediate danger. I\u2019m sorry, Sirius.\u201d\nSirius hung his head, sat back down. Dumbledore left, quietly, shaking Mr Potter\u2019s hand. Moody left too, returning to his station outside the Potter\u2019s front gate. Remus watched him through the window. What a very strange man.\n\u201cMr Potter,\u201d Sirius said, unnaturally polite, \u201cPlease may I borrow some parchment? I\u2019d like to write to Andromeda.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, my boy.\u201d Mr Potter nodded. He led Sirius and James into his study.\nRemus stayed put, feeling that he wasn\u2019t really needed just now. The Potters were there to support Sirius; they could do whatever was necessary. He, Remus, was only really useful when Sirius needed some sense slapped into him (verbally, of course), or when a prank needed ironing out. And there would be plenty of time for those things, once this particular storm had passed.\nAgain, Remus wished he could speak to Grant. There was definitely a phone box in town; if he wanted to, Remus could call St. Edmund\u2019s, and Matron would probably hand the phone over; she wasn\u2019t a jailor. But Moody was, and Remus didn\u2019t much like the idea of explaining why he fancied a trip into the village on Christmas day.\nHe closed his eyes and tried to imagine what Grant might say.\nBloody hell!\nProbably.\n* * *\nThey went to bed early that night. There was nothing else to do \u2013 James didn\u2019t even suggest flying practice. They played a few half-hearted games of chess, but everyone kept yawning so much that in the end it was ridiculous to try and stay up. They piled into James\u2019s bed, even Remus. He tried to manoeuvre it so that James ended up in the middle, but Sirius crawled over them and plonked himself down between his two friends.\n\u201cBudge up, Moony,\u201d he grinned, with a sharp elbow in the ribs.\nRemus kept as close to the edge as possible. Touching Sirius underneath the covers, even with his toe was utterly unthinkable.\nThis is weird,\nhe thought.\nMates don\u2019t share a bed. Even best mates. This is\nso\nweird...\nHe tried to sleep. James began to snore, and Sirius\u2019s breathing levelled out. Remus relaxed. He could\ndefinitely\nimagine what Grant would say to this. \u2018I\nknew\nyou boarding school lads were all poofs!\u2019 Remus couldn\u2019t help chuckling slightly, under his breath. Sirius rolled over to face him, eyes open, wide awake.\n\u201cWhat are you giggling at, Moony?\u201d\n\u201cNothing!\u201d Remus whispered back, embarrassed. \u201cJust not used to sharing a bed.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, James\u2019s snoring is pretty bad.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s weird, right?!\nRemus wanted to say,\ndon\u2019t you think we\u2019re weird??\n\u201cMm.\u201d Was all he said.\n\u201cI can\u2019t sleep.\u201d Sirius sighed.\n\u201cI could get James\u2019s mum? She might have some more potion.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t want any more potion.\u201d Sirius sounded overtired and sulky, like a child. Remus was glad. That made him easier to deal with.\n\u201cWell. Just shut your eyes then.\u201d He instructed.\n\u201cI keep thinking about it.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d\n\u201cNo, not like that, I just mean\u2026 it\u2019s weird, but while they were doing it \u2013 before I sort of stopped thinking \u2013 I was thinking about you.\u201d\n\u201cMe?!\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I was thinking\u2026\nat least now I know how Moony feels\n. When we were researching all that stuff to help you on the full moon, there was a description in one of the records, written by a witch who had lycanthropy. She said the pain of transformation was similar to the\ncruciatus\ncurse.\u201d\n\u201cOh. I never heard that. I don\u2019t think it can be, I think\ncruciatus\nmust be much worse.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Sirius agreed. \u201cBut it helped, a bit. I thought \u2013 if Moony can do it, so can I.\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t have a proper response.\n\u201cGo to sleep, Sirius.\u201d\n\u201cAll right. Night.\u201d\n\u201cNight.\u201d\nHe waited for Sirius to fall asleep \u2013 properly, this time \u2013 then carefully got up, and went back to his own bed."

The Potters hosted a small gathering for New Year\u2019s Eve, but very few people came. Many of their close circle were now working for Dumbledore, Mrs Potter explained, and busy with the war effort. Whatever that was. Their peripheral friends had either turned their backs on the Potters (\u201cwe\u2019re blood traitors,\u201d James proudly declared) or else were simply too frightened to associate themselves.\n\n\nMoody would not hear of Mrs Potter taking Sirius to Diagon Alley, but he needed shoes to begin the new term in, so they all sloped down to the village one afternoon. There, Sirius had fallen madly in love with a pair of brand new black Doc Martens, with bright yellow laces. Remus was pretty jealous; his own pair had been knock-offs from down the market, and had fallen apart long ago.\n\n\nOn their way back from town, they\u2019d passed a couple of punks - a very odd sight in this little country village, but Remus supposed there were teenagers everywhere. One of them had a row of heavy silver rings in the cartilage of one ear. The other had green hair.\n\n\nMrs Potter had forbidden any dyeing of hair, but the night before school was due to begin, Remus had relented after hours of Sirius\u2019s begging, and helped him pierce one of his earlobes using his prefect pin and a potato. It had bled - a lot, but Sirius was thrilled.\n\n\nThus he presented himself before Remus the morning they were setting off for London - he had messed up his hair for volume, flipped it over one shoulder to show off his new gold earring, stood with his legs apart like a guitarist, hands in his pockets, big black bovver boots,\n\n\n\u201cMuggle insight,\u201d he grinned at Remus, putting a cigarette between his teeth, \u201cHow do I look?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLike a twat.\u201d James said.\n\n\n\u201cLike a rock star.\u201d Remus said, groaning inwardly. He was doomed.\n\n\nHe had thought (hoped, really) that Sirius\u2019s trauma might have cooled Remus\u2019s considerable ardour towards his best friend. Might jolt him into realising that \u2013 as friendship was all they would\n\n\never\n\n\nhave \u2013 he ought to focus his energies on just being a bloody good friend. But no. Sirius was a demi-god, and Remus was helpless to do anything but worship him.\n\n\nYou silly, lovesick prat,\n\n\nhe told himself.\n\n\nAt any rate, Remus was glad to be going back to Hogwarts, where lines were very clearly drawn, and there were exams to focus on.\n\n\nSirius turned heads at King\u2019s Cross. Muggles didn\u2019t give him half a glance, but wizards - or, more accurately, witches \u2013 stared. Mary came clacking over to him on the platform in a pair of turquoise suede boots with a heel that brought her up to his height.\n\n\n\u201cHiya gorgeous!\u201d She chirped, then hugged him fiercely, and Remus caught the look on his face over her shoulder. He looked pleased.\n\n\nIt must be nice, after a hard time, to hold someone in your arms like that. Especially someone as emotionally open as Mary. Remus allowed his own pain to peak, then subside, slowly, concentrating on smiling and listening to Marlene tell him all about her Christmas.\n\n\nOnce aboard, they bundled into their usual carriage, and Remus would be forever thankful to Lily, who suggested that he join her in patrolling the length of the train a few times.\n\n\n\u201cYou looked like you could do with some air,\u201d she smiled up at him.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, cheers. Stuffy in there.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFull on Christmas with the marauders, then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou can say that again.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPoor Remus.\u201d She linked her arm with his, leaning against him slightly. It felt nice, like a mini cuddle. She had a small, soft sort of body. Maybe that was the attraction with girls.\n\n\n\u201cI heard about Sirius,\u201d she said, very quietly. \u201cIs he ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus nodded, \u201cThink so. How did you know?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 Sev told me, actually. I didn\u2019t believe him, but based on Sirius\u2019s new look...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFuck. How does he know?\u201d\n\n\nLily shrugged.\n\n\n\u201cDoes everyone know?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOnly that he\u2019s been kicked out. And disinherited. No one knows why.\u201d She was looking at him, and he realised she wanted him to tell her why.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d want everyone to know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good friend.\u201d She patted his arm.\n\n\n\nYeah,\n\n\nhe thought, bitterly.\n\n\nI\u2019m a great friend, me. All I think about is Sirius. Sirius\u2019s safety. Sirius\u2019s happiness. Sirius\u2019s hands, Sirius\u2019s neck, Sirius\u2019s mouth, Sirius throwing me down on the bed and--- Stop. Nope. Not the time. Fuck\u2019s sake.\n\n\n\n\u201cOi!\u201d Lily was shouting, suddenly, pointing down the long corridor of the moving train, \u201cIf that\u2019s you, Crouch, I\u2019ll have your guts for garters\u2026\u201d\n\n\nBarty Crouch. Remus\u2019s stomach turned. He had been there, on Christmas Eve\n\n\n.\n\n\nNasty little creep. The fair haired fourteen year old was tormenting some first year girls, levitating their book bags over their heads. Lily, ever fearless, marched over, threatening detention, loss of points, even a few hexes. He sneered at her, but let the bags drop.\n\n\n\u201cBarty, what are you--oh.\u201d The door of the nearest compartment slid open, and Regulus Black appeared. His eyes narrowed at Lily, \u201cWhat do you want, Evans?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo need to be so rude,\u201d she tutted. She raised an eyebrow at Crouch, \u201cStay out of trouble, or I\u2019ll be speaking with Slughorn. You\u2019re on thin ice already and you know it. C\u2019mon, Remus,\u201d she glanced back at Lupin, who was still standing a little way back, hoping to avoid doing his prefectly duty.\n\n\nRegulus\u2019s head snapped back, he stared at Remus and all of the arrogance vanished. He looked so much younger.\n\n\n\u201cLupin.\u201d He said, stiffly.\n\n\nRemus just nodded. Regulus opened his mouth once or twice. He obviously wanted to ask. Remus wanted to hit him. But not in front of Lily. He remembered Sirius\u2019s desperate concern for his brother and saw it reflected back at him in Regulus\u2019s eyes.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d Remus blurted out.\n\n\nRegulus blinked, then nodded, then turned back into his car, slamming the door. Barty scratched his head in shock, looking very confused.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThursday 15th January 1976\n\n\nAs the second term got into full swing, Remus realised he needn\u2019t have worried so much. He didn\u2019t even have to try to avoid Sirius. OWLs were just around the corner now, scheduled to begin in May, and if the fifth year students thought their workload had been heavy during the first term, they were in for a very rude awakening.\n\n\nRemus combatted this added stress by spending every spare hour he could in the library, or in the common room perfecting practical spells. By the third week, he found that he had somehow become the unelected leader of a sort of homework and revision club \u2013 a group of fifth years, and even some younger students, had started coming to him for tips or advice on their own work.\n\n\n\u201cLupin! What\u2019s the flicky bit you do for locomotive spells? I keep doing it wrong\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus, Remus, is it\n\n\n\u2018Apar-E-cium\u2019\n\n\n, or\n\n\n\u2018A-PAR-ecium\u2019\n\n\n?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHey, Lupin, can you show me how you did that timeline, again? I keep forgetting\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus pretended that he found the whole thing a huge imposition, but he was secretly thrilled. He was\n\n\ngood\n\n\nat something. The marauders \u2013 when he saw them \u2013 thought it was hilarious, and had taken to calling him \u2018professor\u2019.\n\n\nOne student in particular had started joining him for regular study sessions \u2013 a fourth year Gryffindor called Christopher Barley. He was quiet and studious, with serious dark eyes and long, slender fingers. He was shy, but when Remus said hello to him he gave an incredible smile, lighting up from the inside.\n\n\nRemus realised after the third or fourth time he bumped into Christopher somewhere in the castle \u2018by coincidence\u2019, that the younger boy had a crush on him.\n\n\nI\u2019m getting better at this\n\n\n, he thought, guiltily. The feeling was, unfortunately, not at all mutual. Remus was flattered, of course \u2013 it was hard not to be \u2013 but he couldn\u2019t summon up any feelings beyond sympathy for Christopher. Neither of them were brave enough to say anything, which was just as well\n\n\nOn top this this, Remus had his prefect duties, which seemed to multiply with each week. After a Hufflepuff (and muggleborn) prefect had been hexed before Christmas while on a nightly patrol, and not been found until the morning, the heads of each house demanded that prefects patrol in pairs at all times.\n\n\nThese patrols had become a nightly farce, for Remus, as he spent most of the time trying to direct Lily away from wherever the other three marauders were out of bed, working on some nefarious scheme or other. This worked most of the time.\n\n\nThe problem was, that since Christmas James and Sirius had become more daring than ever. Armed with the marauder\u2019s map and the invisibility cloak, they navigated the castle like a pair of pirates, pillaging and laying waste. Several times, Remus would get back from patrol and find them not in their beds - only for the two boys to return an hour later, laughing and full of bravado, telling him how they had almost been caught this time,\n\n\nalmost\n\n\n.\n\n\nQuidditch, too, kept them busy and apart from Remus. The match with Slytherin had been the first game of the year, and resulted in a tie, which meant that both houses were now competing ruthlessly for the cup. With James now at the helm, the Gryffindor team was practicing twice as often every week, and Potter was dragging Sirius out every morning at the crack of dawn for a jog.\n\n\nIn fact, between Remus\u2019s desire to study, his group of disciples and his prefect duties, his scant free time barely ever seemed to coincide with that of his friends\u2019. He barely saw them at mealtimes, or before bed - except for Peter, whose only extracurricular activity was his girlfriend.\n\n\nSo it came as something of a surprise one night in mid-January when Remus bumped into Sirius. It was a routine patrol, and Remus and Lily\u2019s last of the week. The full moon was due in two days, and Remus had cunningly manipulated the prefect\u2019s rota to avoid those nights. He had offered to take charge of the rota for their house, in fact - and the rest of the Gryffindor prefects were obviously relieved. They were all good at their jobs, of course, with a strong sense of justice and fairness, combined with the courage to do the right thing - but few Gryffindors could ever be bothered with the admin. Remus seized this opportunity, and it had so far served him well.\n\n\n\u201cCome on now,\u201d Lily said, as they descended the flight of stairs from the Astronomy tower - usually a hotspot for after-curfew activity, tonight it was deserted - \u201cThe main ingredients in a calming draught, list them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cErr\u2026\u201d Remus huffed, as his hip clicked on the last stair. He was just glad he had a lot of energy shortly before the moon, \u201cLacewing flies, dew from a field of clover, sea water, and\u2026 um\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh come on, Remus!\u201d Lily sighed, exasperated, \u201cThis is fourth year stuff!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know, but I can never---wait, did you hear that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSh!\u201d\n\n\nHe was sure he had heard a sigh, or a gasp, and now, in the perfect silence, he was aware that he could hear two more heartbeats nearby, pounding hard. And the scent of something else, something exciting and heady. He ripped back the nearest tapestry, raising his wand.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nLumos\n\n\n!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMary!\u201d Lily gasped.\n\n\n\u201cMoony!\u201d Sirius said.\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you two doing?!\u201d Lily said, immediately adopting her authoritative voice, which Remus thought was eerily close to McGonagall\u2019s.\n\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t guess, Evans?\u201d Sirius winked at her. His arms were still protectively wrapped around Mary\u2019s waist, his hair had fallen forward untidily and his mouth was redder than usual. Mary\u2019s blouse was unbuttoned almost down to her navel, and she was hurriedly trying to cover up.\n\n\n\u201cWe ought to give you both detention,\u201d Lily raised an eyebrow at her friend,\n\n\n\u201cOh, be nice, Lily,\u201d Mary cajoled, a soft smile on her lips, \u201cEveryone does it, just a bit of fun.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 as this is the first time,\u201d Lily relented, \u201cCome on, we\u2019re heading back to the Tower now anyway.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFive more minutes?\u201d Sirius asked, cheekily, much to Lily\u2019s horror. Mary laughed and slapped him playfully.\n\n\n\u201cBad boy!\u201d She giggled, buttoning up her shirt. \u201cC\u2019mon, it\u2019s not like anything else was happening tonight.\u201d\n\n\nThe four of them walked back to Gryffindor common room together, the girls giggling and whispering together, occasionally sneaking glances back at Sirius, before bursting into giggles all over again. Sirius played up to this, walking with an exaggerated swagger, tucking his long hair behind one ear and winking at them when they looked. He tried to catch Remus\u2019s eye a few time, as if to let him in on the \u00a0joke, but Remus kept looking forward and said nothing.\n\n\n\u201cAlright, Moony?\u201d Sirius asked, when they were all in their beds and still had not spoken. He sounded a bit worried now.\n\n\nGood\n\n\n, thought Remus.\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus replied, rolling over and closing his eyes."

            "content": "Monday 18th January 1976\n\n\nRemus Lupin had absolutely no interest whatsoever in the Forbidden Forest at any other time of the month. Care of Magical Creatures had given him a healthy respect for the beasts who lived there, and he was inclined to give them a wide berth.\n\n\nThe wolf clearly felt otherwise. James and Sirius - or rather, Prongs and Padfoot as they were now known - had very little trouble leading the werewolf out of the shack and into the green velvet darkness of the woods. Remus\u2019s memories of the full moons were much better than they ever had been - but still not quite human, and therefore less complete. He remembered scents, shapes, noises and even tastes, sometimes.\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stop you chasing rabbits if you want to chase rabbits,\u201d James shrugged, when Remus woke up that morning distressed by the blood on his tongue. \u201cYou seemed pretty happy about it at the time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was bloody good fun,\u201d Sirius put in, licking his own lips.\n\n\n\u201cYou were encouraging me!\u201d Remus accused, pulling his trousers on underneath his blanket. \u201cYou ought to know better, you have self control!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius shrugged, \u201cBut when I\u2019m a dog, I\u2019m a dog. It\u2019s what we do.\u201d\n\n\nThat was Sirius all over. Have all the fun and take no responsibility.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Moony,\u201d James yawned, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t ever let you hurt a person. And you\n\n\ndid\n\n\nhave fun, I promise.\u201d\n\n\nHe didn't need James to tell him that. As much as the human Remus prefered to remain aloof, and separate himself from those baser instincts the wolf represented, he couldn\u2019t wait for the next moon.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better be off,\u201d he yawned back, \u201cSee if you can get a bit of kip before breakfast.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, all right,\u201d James nodded sleepily, \u201cSee ya, Moony.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBye Prongs.\u201d\n\n\n\u2018Prongs\u2019 had been a stroke of genius one afternoon, when Peter had forgotten the word for \u2018antlers\u2019. They\u2019d all laughed so hard the name had stuck. Remus wasn\u2019t sure where \u2018Padfoot\u2019 had come from. Likely a private joke between James and Sirius. Anyway, it made sense, and they had settled into their new names comfortably, sealing them into the marauder\u2019s map.\n\n\nMadam Pomfrey gave him the once over when he arrived, then just sent him on his way.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even need the stretcher anymore,\u201d she marvelled, \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got a good colour in your cheeks. Rest this morning, but if you're feeling up to it you may as well attend your afternoon lessons.\u201d\n\n\nHe felt terrible for lying to her about the reason for his miraculous recoveries, but it couldn\u2019t be helped.\n\n\nRemus managed to sleep through the rest of the morning, and awoke a bit too early for lunch. He went down to the common room to sit by an open window and smoke while he went over his history notes for the afternoon. All things considered, he thought to himself, other than the Sirius problem, life was going pretty well.\n\n\nSirius had bungled an apology, about the Astronomy Tower incident - Remus heavily suspected this was a result of a conference with James.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, Moony, I should have checked with you, or used the map or something, I\n\n\nknow\n\n\nyou hate all that girl stuff, and I know you\u2019ve done loads to keep us out of trouble this year\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus had put on a great show of mulling this apology over, then forgiving his friend, because anything else would have been highly suspicious. He was mortified when even Mary came to offer her own apology, and spluttered that he hadn\u2019t minded in the least.\n\n\nHe liked Mary. He didn\u2019t want to feel this way about her; none of it was her fault, exactly. And, as James so often said, Sirius deserved a bit of fun, considering the year he was having.\n\n\n\u201cHiya, Remus!\u201d A small voice interrupted his thoughts. he realised he hadn\u2019t so much as glanced at his notes yet, and his cigarette had burnt all the way down, unsmoked.\n\n\n\u201cHi, Christopher,\u201d Remus nodded, frowning as he brushed the ash off his sleeve. \u201cY\u2019ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the younger boy grinned and hopped up to join him on the window seat. He was smaller than Remus - but so was everyone. \u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHistory.\u201d Remus said, through his teeth as he lit another fag.\n\n\n\u201cCool!\u201d Christopher grinned. Remus raised an eyebrow, but said nothing. \u201cI won\u2019t bother you, then.\u201d Christopher said, hopefully. \u201cIf you\u2019re busy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Remus asked, not wanting to hurt his feelings. There were enough hurt feelings in the world and he refused to be responsible for anyone\u2019s but his own.\n\n\n\u201cUm, well, nothing really. It\u2019s a Hogsmeade weekend, this weekend.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Remus shifted uncomfortably in the seat. Surely Christopher wouldn\u2019t be so gauche as to ask him out?! He had to nip it in the bud at once, \u201cI er\u2026 I\u2019m going with my mates, y\u2019know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, right. Er... James Potter and Sirius Black and that other one\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d\n\n\nHe could tell that Christopher - like most of the younger Gryffindors - teetered between awe and fear where the marauders were concerned. They were simply\n\n\nso\n\n\ndaring, and\n\n\nso\n\n\nsuccessful, it was intimidating.\n\n\n\u201cWell I was just thinking, that\u2019s all.\u201d Christopher cleared his throat, \u201cYou know how we were talking about that new Arithmancy book, i thought we could see if anywhere was stocking it yet.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry, Christopher,\u201d Remus said, as gently as possible, \u201cI really am busy\u2026 er\u2026 maybe another time?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk. Yeah, of course\u2026\u201d\n\n\nChristopher looked crestfallen. Remus felt bad, but what else could he do? and he really did have plans - not with the marauders, actually; he had another phone call planned with Grant. After the incident with Sirius and Mary Remus had hastily scribbled down a request to speak with Grant and sent it to Matron first thing the next morning. He somewhat regretted to now, having calmed down a fair bit - but was still looking forward to speaking with Grant if he could.\n\n\n\u201cHiya Moony!\u201d Sirius came bounding across the common room from the portrait hole he\u2019d just entered through. He leaned against the wall beside remus and Christopher, grinning that Sirius Black grin.\n\n\n\u201cHi Padfoot,\u201d Remus smiled back - he hoped he didn\u2019t look at Sirius the way Christopher looked at him. That would be embarrassing.\n\n\n\u201cSo, settle a bet for me and Prongs,\u201d Sirius began, completely ignoring Christopher, who got up and mumbled a goodbye, before making a hasty exit. Sirius wasted no time in flinging himself into the empty space on the window seat, \u201cHow many nifflers would we need to find Rowena Ravenclaw\u2019s lost diadem?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is a diadem?\u201d Remus smirked.\n\n\n\u201cLike a crown.\u201d Sirius snatched Remus\u2019s newly lit cigarette and held it to his own lips. Remus had to struggle not to moan at the sight. He simply took out a third cigarette.\n\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d he said, inhaling deeply, \u201cWould you and James want a crown?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Sirius shrugged, \u201cFinding treasure seems like a marauder-type pursuit. Hey, what did that kid want?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cChristopher.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh, he in your fan club?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStudy group.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPfft. What did he want?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe was asking me out,\u201d Remus replied, dryly. Looking out of the window. Apparently not dryly enough - when he looked back at Sirius, his mouth was agape.\n\n\nOh god, Sirius\u2019s mouth.\n\n\n\u201cJoking, Padfoot,\u201d Remus said, with a smirk. He had perfected sarcastic smirks.\n\n\nSirius snorted.\n\n\n\u201cGood one, Moony. Thought you were serious there.\u201d\n\n\nRemus considered saying \u2018no,\n\n\nyou\u2019re\n\n\nSirius\u2019, but that joke had been wearing thin since first year, and would only earn him a punch in the arm. He settled for a shrug and another pull on his fag.\n\n\n\u201cIf you did fancy going out with someone, though,\u201d Sirius said, slyly, \u201cWho d\u2019you reckon? Lily or Marlene?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up.\u201d Remus rolled his eyes.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Sirius continued, conversationally, \u201cLily\u2019s taken - I mean, she doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s taken, of course\u2026 so Marlene it is! Hogsmeade on Saturday?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you asking me out on Marlene\u2019s behalf?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can get her to ask you out herself, if you want, I just thought you\u2019d say yes to me.\u201d\n\n\n\nI\u2019d say yes to you\n\n\n. Remus thought, pathetically.\n\n\n\u201cMarlene\u2019s not interested in me.\u201d He said. This, he had decided, was better than saying \u2018\n\n\nI\u2019m\n\n\nnot interested in\n\n\nher\n\n\n\u2019 - because of course that would only invite the question \u2018why not?\u2019\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Course she is, you\u2019re friends, aren\u2019t you? Anyway,. you have to come, we\u2019re doing it to support James.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNow James is involved.\u201d Remus stubbed out his cigarette and stood up, shoving his history notes into his bag. they obviously weren\u2019t getting read now. \u201cLunch?\u201d He said.\n\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d Sirius nodded, flicked his own cigarette out of the window and stood up. They headed for the portrait hole. \u201cYes, James is involved,\u201d Sirius continued, as they made their way to the Great Hall. \u201cWe all need to be there - and ideally coupled up - so that he can ask Evans out.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJames asks Lily out once a week.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Sirius nodded, \u201cBut this time he\u2019s going in with a game plan.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a song and everything.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJames writes songs?!\u201d Remus\u2019s mask dropped for a moment in genuine surprise.\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Sirius licked his lips, \u201cI may have given him a hand\u2026 anyway, we all need to have dates, to plant the idea in her mind. Like that muggle psychology stuff.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAs much as I\u2019d love to see James make a prat out of himself in the name of true love,\u201d Remus laughed, \u201cI\u2019m busy on Saturday.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoing what?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNone of your business,\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSee, Moony,\u201d Sirius sighed, \u201cThis is why the girls can't get enough of you, so mysterious.\u201d\n\n\nRemus wasn\u2019t sure if Sirius was making a cruel joke, so he left it there. They walked quietly for a little bit. \u201cHey, Moony?\u201d Sirius started again.\n\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you fancy Mary?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\n\nThey had stopped just outside the lunch hall, and remus spun around to face Sirius in shock. Sirius looked embarrassed, fiddled with his earring,\n\n\n\u201cWell you\u2019ve been a bit\u2026 off since we started going out. And I\u2019ve hardly seen you since the, er\u2026 the tapestry fiasco.\u201d\n\n\nRemus snorted.\n\n\n\u201cNo. I do not fancy Mary.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk good,\u201d Sirius smiled at him. \u201cSo you\u2019ll be Marlene\u2019s date?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStill busy, sorry.\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nSaturday 31st January 1976\n\n\nRemembering that the last time he had tried to have a private phone call he had been followed, Remus asked to borrow James\u2019s cloak for their trip into Hogsmeade. Good old James - you could rely on him not to ask loads of questions. Especially when he was distracted by his nerves over asking Lily out.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, \u2018course Moony, \u2018course\u2026\u201d he murmured, staring at himself in the mirror, \u201cIt\u2019s under the bed. Hey, would you say my hair needs trimming? Looks a bit untidy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt does look untidy,\u201d Remus said, from under the bed, \u201cBut a trim won\u2019t help. Don\u2019t worry, girls think it\u2019s charming.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah? Yeah, you\u2019re right\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve asked her out before,\u201d Remus said, emerging with the cloak and brushing the dust from his robes, \u201cHow can you be nervous?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m bloody mad about her.\u201d James replied, without missing a beat. \u201cYou know when you just can\u2019t get \u2018em out of your mind, and in your head it\u2019s great, and everything\u2019s going the way you want - but then they\u2019re there, in front of you, and\u2026 well it all goes to shit, because she\u2019s just so much more spectacular in real life, y\u2019know?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus mrmurded, thumbing the fabric of the invisibility cloak as Sirius exited the bathroom.\n\n\nDown in the village, Remus wished James good luck before disappearing into the gent\u2019s at the Three Broomsticks, throwing on the cloak and then walking straight out again. This time he was able to arrive at the old muggle phone box at exactly the right time, and excitedly keyed in the number.\n\n\n\u201cOi oi, happy new year and all that,\u201d Grant\u2019s voice rattled up the wire. Remus beamed,\n\n\n\u201cHappy new year! I had a card for you, but I never sent it. Sorry.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cS\u2019long as you remember my birthday.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh! Er, ok, when is it?\u201d\n\n\nGrant barked with laughter,\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\n\n\njoking\n\n\nyou silly sod. I never sent you no card either.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStill taking ya\u2019self too seriously, then.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus chuckled, \u201cI s\u2019pose. How are you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShit.\u201d Grant replied, his voice going slightly high as he inhaled - Remus guessed he was smoking. \u201cBloody terrible, actually. But don\u2019t you worry. My problem.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, tell me, go on. I might be able to help.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust Matron. Don\u2019t worry. Hey, how are things with your posho loverboy? Over it yet?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus sighed, \u201cWorse, if anything.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, thought as much.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou said it wouldn\u2019t last!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLied to make you feel better.\u201d\n\n\nRemus couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Thank god for Grant.\n\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m going mad.\u201d He said, whispering into the phone the secrets he hadn\u2019t been able to say out loud. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m just going to do something crazy. He\u2019s so\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBe careful.\u201d Grant warned, \u201cRemember what I said.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus sighed again. \u201cSo, how was your Christmas?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCrap. I was s\u2019posed to go to me gran\u2019s, but grandad cancelled it at the last minute. Didn\u2019t want his nancy-boy grandson showing him up in front of the neighbours. Next time I see him, I\u2019ll wear a dress.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry, Grant.\u201d Remus said, quietly, feeling even worse about not having sent the card.\n\n\n\u201cAww shuddup,\u201d Grant replied, and Remus could tell he was smiling, \u201cLike I said, not your problem. Oi, I might not be here much longer, though. I\u2019m er\u2026 probably going to be moved on. Haven\u2019t exactly been going to school...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere will you go?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDunno. Think I\u2019m done with \u2018omes. Might go up London, got some mates there.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow will I find you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBless ya.\u201d Grant said, \u201cForgot how sweet you was. You could gimme your address an\u2019 I\u2019ll do my best to write?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026 can\u2019t.\u201d Remus felt a horrible tearing on the inside. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, I wish I could, I really do\u2026 my school isn\u2019t really a normal sort of school, and\u2026 well it\u2019s not really possible.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell. That\u2019s that, then.\u201d Grant replied.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nRemus trudged back to the village with a heavy heart. All that obsessing over Sirius had come to nothing, and now he was at risk of losing someone just as important. Someone who actually fancied him back, too. Apparently Remus was only interested in people he couldn\u2019t have. He would look up locating spells, as soon as possible, he decided. He wasn\u2019t going to lose track of Grant like that.\n\n\nHe was mildly cheered upon entering the Three Broomsticks to see Snape sitting in a corner, alone, glaring about the room. Remus went straight back into the gent\u2019s, removed the cloak and then walked out, being sure to catch Severus\u2019s eye. The Slytherin boy nearly fell off his bar stool in surprise. Remus smirked as he walked over to join his friends.\n\n\nThey were all there - Peter and Desdemona, Sirius and Mary, Marlene, James and Lily. Lily looked very pink in the face, but very smug, and James was looking at the bottom of his empty glass. He was dripping wet, and smelled sickly sweet. Evidently, the serenade had not gone down well.\n\n\n\u201cMoony!\u201d Sirius boomed, invitingly, \u201cYou missed all the fun!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, sorry,\u201d Remus smiled at everyone politely, pulling out his own chair. Sirius motioned to the pretty barmaid for another butterbeer. \u201cEr\u2026\u201d Remus glanced at James, then Lily. \u201cHow is\u2026 everyone?\u201d\n\n\nPeter let out a strange, high pitched giggle, then clamped his hand over his mouth. Sirius raised an eyebrow.\n\n\n\u201cOh, quite well, Moony, quite well\u2026 I was just saying, it\u2019s been a while since the marauders have done a proper prank.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou put stink bombs under the rug in the Slytherin common room last week.\u201d Lily said.\n\n\n\u201cAnd yesterday you reversed the lenses on all of the telescopes in the Astronomy Tower.\u201d Marlene said.\n\n\n\u201cAnd you said that tomorrow you were planning to--\u201d Mary started, but Sirius rolled his eyes,\n\n\n\u201cYeah yeah, but those things are child\u2019s play.\u201d He said, decidedly. \u201cPlus, that was just me and James mucking about. A\n\n\nproper\n\n\nmarauder prank needs all four of us.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus doesn\u2019t want to join in with your silly pranks,\u201d Lily said.\n\n\n\u201cYes I do.\u201d Remus replied - partly because he was in a bad mood and felt contrary, partly out of solidarity for poor James, who still had butterbear dripping from the end of his nose."

But Sirius\u2019s high spirits at the prospect of all four marauders working together again meant that the idea kept growing and expanding, until it somehow involved four-hundred dungbombs, a timing delay spell, and all four of them out of bed after curfew.\nThey\u2019d put it off long enough. Even if Remus agreed to forgo his homework for an evening, they had to gather the materials (he didn\u2019t ask where they got their hands on four hundred dungbombs. Best not to know), and then contend with quidditch practice and the prefect patrol rota. Then there was a full moon. All told, the first night all of them were available ended up being at the end of February.\n\u201cBeen a while!\u201d James grinned as he disappeared under the cloak.\nPeter\u2019s ability to turn into a rat was incredibly useful, especially when he could shrink down and rest on James\u2019s shoulder under the invisibility cloak. Unfortunately, tall as they all were now, three was still too many to properly fit.\n\u201cYou two use the cloak,\u201d Remus sighed, pulling it off after trying to squat low enough so that it didn\u2019t show their ankles, \u201cI\u2019ll just flash my prefect pin if anyone asks what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\u201cTakes all the fun out of it, though.\u201d Sirius complained, slightly muffled under the fabric.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll still find a way to have fun,\u201d Remus said. \u201cCome on then.\u201d\nThey left the dorm room and made their way down the stairs to leave Gryffindor Tower. Remus had to walk slowly so that the others could keep up, but he was anxious to get it over with. It was a good idea and everything - but it was going to take most of the night if they wanted all of their bases covered, and he had an early start on Tuesday.\n\u201cHiya, Remus!\u201d\nNo sooner had they turned a corner than they had bumped into Christopher. This was getting ridiculous. Everywhere he turned, if Snape wasn\u2019t watching him, then Christopher was. Remus steeled himself and smiled broadly, deeply conscious that the three marauders stood just behind him, invisible.\n\u201cHi Christopher, how\u2019s it going?\u201d\n\u201cNot bad!\u201d The delighted boy chirped back, \u201cI was just going to the common room, fancy a game of chess?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 sorry, I\u2019m on patrol.\u201d Remus tapped his metal badge.\n\u201cOh right. Where\u2019s Lily, then?\u201d\n\u201cIn the loo.\u201d He said, quickly. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for her.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll wait with you!\u201d Christopher grinned. Remus fought the urge to slap his forehead in disbelief.\n\u201cOh no,\u201d he laughed, trying to keep his tone friendly, \u201cNo, you go off to the common room\u2026 it\u2019s nearly curfew, I don\u2019t want to have to give you detention!\u201d\n\u201cOh, ok then.\u201d Christopher nodded. Remus only ever disappointed him. \u201cSee you later, maybe? I forgot to say, I\u2019m so excited about your party!\u201d\n\u201cMy what?!\u201d\nThere was a low groan of annoyance just behind Remus. Fortunately, Christopher didn\u2019t seem to hear it.\n\u201cYour birthday party! I can\u2019t wait, I couldn\u2019t come to Sirius Black\u2019s party in November, I had a Potions essay due, but this year I\u2019ll make sure to get everything out of the way first!\u201d\n\u201cT\u2019riffic,\u201d Remus replied, giving him a thumbs up.\nJust go away, for god\u2019s sake!\n\u201cSee you there, then.\u201d\nChristopher bounced off, quite happily. Remus smirked and turned to the invisible boys over his shoulder.\n\u201cMy party, eh?\u201d\n\u201cIt was supposed to be a surprise!\u201d James whispered.\n\u201cWho\nis\nthat little git, anyway?!\u201d Sirius asked.\n\u201cLeave him alone,\u201d Remus tutted, \u201cHe\u2019s just friendly.\u201d\n\u201cSuch a benevolent professor.\u201d James laughed. \u201cHe\u2019ll be bringing you apples next.\u201d\n\u201cWell, one of you should tell him I prefer chocolate, then,\u201d Remus replied, breezily, as they made their way further along the hallway\nThey distributed the dung bombs as quickly as they could, and Remus performed the timing delay incantation - something he had been playing around with for a while. The key was making sure the dungbombs were scattered equally throughout the castle, in order to cause maximum chaos.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spaced the times out at hourly intervals,\u201d Remus explained quietly, \u201cI reckon it should take Filch about an hour to clear away the first lot, so as soon as he\u2019s finished the second lot will go off\u2026 then the third.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll never make fun of you again, Moony,\u201d Sirius promised. \u201cYou bloody legend.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well as long as no one knows it was me.\u201d He laughed, \u201cI\u2019ve got my reputation to think of.\u201d\n\u201cOoh yeah, can\u2019t have little Christopher finding out his hero is a bad boy, can we?\u201d\nRemus elbowed him sharply in the side.\n\u201cHurry up,\u201d Peter - now human - said, wringing his hands, \u201cI promised I\u2019d try and say goodnight to Dezzie before curfew\u2026 can we do the Ravenclaw floor next?\u201d\n\u201cAh, young love,\u201d James chuckled, \u201cGiving your girlfriend a goodnight kiss as your friends booby trap her exit points\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShe thinks it\u2019s funny,\u201d Peter shrugged, slightly pink.\n\u201cOi, Pete, how far have you got with Desdemona, anyway?\u201d Sirius asked brusquely.\nPeter blinked wildly a few times. He was not used to being so addressed by Sirius - who had lately been asking him all sorts of questions since beginning his relationship with Mary. Remus had the idea that Sirius saw it all as an extension of the snogging competition.\n\u201cErr\u2026 what do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Sirius continued, juggling a few dungbombs carelessly, \u201cOver the clothes or under the clothes, above the waist or below the--\u201d\n\u201cNothing like that!\u201d Peter was bright red now. \u201cAnd\u2026 it\u2019s none of your business anyway.\u201d\n\u201cOh go on, I\u2019ll tell you how far I\u2019ve got with MacDonald.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to kno--\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s let me feel up her--\u201d\n\u201cOk, finished!\u201d Remus said, loudly. \u201cNext stop, Ravenclaw!\u201d\nIt took them almost another hour, and it was well past curfew by the time they had finished everything.\n\u201cIn hindsight,\u201d James yawned, \u201cWe should have started laying them further from the common room and worked our way back.\u201d\nRemus nodded drowsily.\n\u201cWe did it, though!\u201d Sirius cheered. \u201cThe marauders are back!\u201d\n\u201cWe never went anywhere,\u201d Peter muttered. He was still annoyed for having been put on the spot earlier.\nThey were over halfway back when Remus caught Mrs Norris\u2019s scent. He shushed the others, and Peter quickly transformed into a rat, more out of nervousness than anything. James was just raising the cloak to cover them all, when the cat appeared, mewing disdainfully at them. Sirius, still full of energy, winked at James,\n\u201cWatch this!\u201d and turned into a dog. He barked three times, and Mrs Norris turned tail and ran. Sirius turned back, laughing hysterically.\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?!\u201d Filch\u2019s voice echoed around the same corner.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done it now!\u201d Remus moaned, \u201cYou idiot!\u201d\n\u201cRun!\u201d James said, and set off at full pelt towards the common room, Peter squeaking behind him. Remus tried to keep up, but his hip wouldn\u2019t allow it, and he was soon out of breath. Sirius hung back with him, much to his annoyance,\n\u201cGo!\u201d He panted, waving a hand at Sirius, \u201cI might not get in trouble, but\nyou\nwill, don\u2019t slow down\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNonsense, Moony,\u201d Sirius said, looking around quickly. His face lit up, \u201cIn here!\u201d Sirius grabbed Remus by the wrist and yanked him into a nearby broom cupboard, closing the door as quietly as possible.\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d Remus hissed, annoyed, snatching back his hand, \u201cNow if we get caught they\u2019ll\nknow\nwe were up to something.\u201d\n\u201cOh, relax will you?\u201d Sirius retorted, \u201cThe worst we\u2019ll get is detention. You used to get loads of detentions, you used to be\nfun\n.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m\nsorry\nif my idea of fun doesn\u2019t involved spending all night stuck in a cupboard with you!\u201d Remus whispered back, hotly. It was dark, and he knew Sirius couldn\u2019t see him as well as Remus could see Sirius.\n\u201c\nLumos\n!\u201d Sirius whispered, lighting his wand point and rummaging in his pocket. There wasn\u2019t much room, and he kept jostling into Remus\u2019s hip.\n\u201cWhat are you doing now!?\u201d Remus snapped, trying to edge away as much as possible. Why couldn\u2019t he have ended up trapped with James? Or Peter? Peter would have been perfect.\n\u201cCalm your tits,\u201d Sirius grunted, \u201cI\u2019ve got the map\u2026 hang on.. aha!\u201d He withdrew the blank parchment from his back pocket, and tapped it with his wand, \u201cI solemnly swear that I am up to no good\u2026\u201d\nNothing.\nSirius cleared his throat, \u201cAhem. I solemnly swear that I am up to no good\u2026 Moony, it\u2019s broken.\u201d\n\u201cOr that\u2019s just a bit of old parchment and someone else has the map.\u201d Remus suggested.\n\u201cPotter! I\u2019ll bloody kill him.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s good.\u201d Remus said, thinking fast, \u201cIf James has it, then he can find us. Or at least he knows where we are.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah I suppose you\u2019re right. Think we should wait, then?\u201d\n\u201cWell since you\u2019ve put us in a corner, I don\u2019t think we have a choice.\u201d\nSirius sighed, heavily. Remus felt his breath against his collar bone. He tried to twist away again, feeling an alarming tightening in his trousers.\n\u201cGodric,\u201d Sirius huffed, \u201cWhat is your problem?!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Remus reacted, surprised.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been dragging your heels about this prank for ages, avoiding me and James since Christmas--\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been revising and you\u2019ve had quidditch! We\u2019re not twelve anymore, we can\u2019t spend all our time together.\u201d\n\u201cSeem to spend plenty of time with Evans.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re prefects together, she helps me with potions.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the mood?\u201d\n\u201cWhat mood?\u201d\n\u201cYou! You\u2019ve been grumpy all year.\u201d\nRemus was pretty miffed to be called \u2018moody\u2019 by Gryffindor\u2019s resident drama queen, but he held his tongue. It was no good getting into a fight, not when you were so close your knees were knocking together.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Exam stress.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d Sirius said, defiantly. His wand had gone out, but he was looking right at Remus. Maybe he\ncould\nsee in the dark. Dogs could, couldn\u2019t they? His eyes burned like filaments. \u201cSomething\u2019s\nwrong\n, Moony, tell me.\u201d\n\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. Leave it alone, will you?\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d Sirius replied, his voice softer now, less aggressive. \u201cOk, but I wish you\u2019d tell me. You used to tell me your secrets.\u201d\n\u201cLook, this isn\u2019t the time.\u201d Remus whispered, closing his eyes and turning his head away. \u201cWe\u2019re about to get caught out of bed and probably get a month of detentions. We need to be quiet.\u201d\nHe felt Sirius nod, and they said no more.\nHe could come up with an excuse, Remus thought, for the mood. If exam stress didn\u2019t work, then maybe mention the war. The marauders hadn\u2019t really discussed it in detail, and it\nwas\non Remus\u2019s mind, so he hoped that was more believable. But he didn\u2019t want to remind Sirius, after everything he\u2019d already been through. He\nhad\nconsidered mentioning his Snape problem - but was equally concerned about Sirius\u2019s reaction to that. He\u2019d been getting in enough trouble, lately, and Remus didn\u2019t want anyone going after Severus on his account. He\u2019d deal with that himself.\nSome nights, when he couldn\u2019t sleep, Remus had even mulled over the possibility of claiming he\ndid\nhave a crush on Mary. He was sure that Sirius would be understanding, and it seemed like an easy way out. Or else he could pretend Grant was a girl, and tell them all about that. He had decided not to, and felt guilt for even coming up with the idea. It was dishonest at best, and disrespectful at worst, even if Grant never found out.\nThere was nothing to do but wait for it to pass.\nGod, it was warm, squashed up in a cupboard like that. Remus did everything he could to keep his back pressed hard against the wall. There was barely any room at all; if Sirius so much as stepped forward an inch they would be touching, and if - horror of horrors - they came into contact anywhere below the waist he would find out that Remus was stiff as a rod.\nIt was torture.\n\u201cMoony?\u201d Sirius whispered, so quietly Remus thought he might have imagined it. But he was looking up at him, a strange look on his face, \u201cAre you--\u201d\nSuddenly, blessedly, the door swung open, to reveal James grinning at them, Wormtail on his shoulder.\n\u201cHaving fun, lads?\u201d\nRemus could have kissed him.\n\u201cOur hero,\u201d he smiled weakly."

            "content": "Tuesday 9th March 1976\nIt was a miracle of epic proportions that none of them were caught \u2013 and even more miraculous that their prank went off without a hitch the next day, resulting in a morning off lessons while Filch dealt with the terrible stench. The rest of the classes took place outside on the grounds in the early spring sunshine, which, as far as the marauders were concerned, was a win.\nAdditionally, Sirius could barely contain his glee when they all returned to their common rooms that evening to find a notice pinned to the corkboard reminding students that dogs were not on the approved list for pets at Hogwarts. This caused a huge amount of confusion among the rest of the student populace of course,\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a dog! Who\u2019s got a dog?\u201d\n\u201cIf one of the Slytherins got a dog in, then I want to bring my rabbit from home!\u201d\n\u201cI think I have seen one in the grounds, actually \u2013 maybe it\u2019s a stray?\u201d\nNeedless to say, Sirius and James were in their element.\n\u201cI\u2019ll sniff him out!\u201d Sirius announced,\n\u201cI bet he\u2019s right under our noses!\u201d James laughed.\n\u201cCould be closer than we think!\u201d\nRemus laughed too, trying to mask his unease. Sirius had so far said nothing about the half an hour in that broom cupboard. Remus could only assume that either:\na) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sirius had not found anything out of the ordinary, and in fact Remus was once again overthinking things (likely), or;\nb) \u00a0 Sirius now knew everything about Remus, his darkest desires and deepest secrets \u2013 and preferred not to address it because the whole \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 thing was just too embarrassing (less likely, but more frightening).\nAt any rate, Remus threw himself into his schoolwork, his prefect duties and generally being a model student. This at least ensured that he was out of Sirius\u2019s way \u2013 Sirius had evidently decided to do the complete opposite.\nHe had never exactly been the best at following rules, of course. But even James admitted that this year Sirius appeared to be attempting some kind of record. He was in detention almost every night, rarely completed his homework (even though he could do it with one arm tied behind his back, if he wanted to) and split the rest of his time between making mischief and seeing how far he could get his tongue down Mary MacDonald\u2019s throat. Not that Mary seemed to mind, much.\nThat was fine. That was just as it should be.\nIt wasn\u2019t easy, though. As much of a relief it was to be away from the one person that he couldn\u2019t be sensible around \u2013 Remus also found it very distressing to be away from the one person he couldn\u2019t be sensible around. Marlene and Lily were lovely \u2013 they were kind and funny and clever and generous. But they were a poor substitute for the marauders.\nHe even tried spending a bit more time talking to Christopher \u2013 asking him questions about home, or the music he liked. It was worse than he\u2019d expected. Christopher was a pureblood wizard, who didn\u2019t know any muggle music, and didn\u2019t appear to be that interested in hearing any. On top of that, he had realised his error in spoiling Remus\u2019s birthday surprise, and wouldn\u2019t stop apologising, which was incredibly annoying.\nRemus had already promised James that he would act surprised when the party was unveiled in his honour. He\u2019d tried to talk them all out of it, of course \u2013 but he\u2019d been pleading for moderation since first year, and knew he wasn\u2019t likely to get it.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make a fuss on my account!\u201d He said, at dinner the morning before, \u201cLily will go mental\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWrong,\u201d James said, smugly, \u201cLily sent out half the invitations!\u201d\n\u201cInvitations?!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve had a lot of interest. Considered charging entry, actually.\u201d Sirius explained, eyes twinkling across the table.\nRemus looked at his food, quickly. He had decided not to make eye contact with Sirius ever again. It would not be easy, but it was the only way; of this he was convinced.\n\u201cYour little library gang wanted to come,\u201d James continued, \u201cAnd they\u2019re not all Gryffindors, so we had to open it up to other houses\u2026 then there\u2019s this weird group of seventh years who said you\u2019re a \u2018total legend\u2019 - no idea what that\u2019s about, have you got a secret double life or something, Moony?\u201d\nRemus shrugged. He still had some students asking for cigarettes, though he didn\u2019t sell them anymore. He usually didn\u2019t mind lending fags though, as long as they were eventually repaid.\n\u201cWell, anyway,\u201d James pushed his glasses up his nose, \u201cYou simply have too many fans, Moony, and we can\u2019t let them all down at short notice, can we?\u201d\n\u201cFine. No drinking, though.\u201d Remus sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a school night.\u201d\n* * *\nWednesday 10th March 1976\nIt rained, the morning of Remus\u2019s birthday, but he couldn\u2019t have cared less. He woke up to a pile of presents from the Potters \u2013 all sorts of lovely things like sweets and a home baked birthday cake, plus a fine leather bound notebook and matching quill. There were cards from everybody \u2013 including one from Professor Ferox, which made Remus blush from top to bottom.\nAt breakfast, the marauders conducted almost the entire school in a rendition of \u2018happy birthday\u2019 which ended up running to five encores before Remus attempted to crawl under the table to escape it. The Slytherins scowled, stony faced, and in a fit of birthday\njoie de vivre\nRemus actually stuck his tongue out at Snape.\nThe marauders then piled his plate high with a slice of toast for each available topping, and handed over their own gifts. Sirius and James were in their quidditch robes ready for an early morning practice before lessons.\n\u201cDo we\nhave\nto, Potter?\u201d Marlene whined, looking up at the enchanted ceiling which was grey and drizzly.\n\u201cYes, if we want that cup.\u201d James asserted, pouring her another mug of coffee. \u201cAnd again, after last bell, before the\u2026 you-know-what.\u201d He winked at Marlene so elaborately that Remus almost burst out laughing.\n\u201cSmooth, Potter.\u201d Marlene raised an eyebrow.\n\u201cRight, I\u2019ve got to get to the library,\u201d Mary said brightly, climbing up off of Sirius\u2019s lap, \u201cGot to hand that Divination book back before Pince calls to have me hung, drawn and quartered.\u201d\n\u201cSee you after second quidditch?\u201d Sirius asked, still holding Mary at the hips.\n\u201cNah,\u201d she shook her head, ringlets bouncing, \u201cI\u2019m\nreally\nbehind on History, thought I\u2019d drop in on one of Remus\u2019s classes.\u201d\n\u201c\nStudy sessions\n.\u201d Remus corrected, quickly, careful not to look at the couple for too long.\n\u201cWhatever you say, Professor Lupin,\u201d she grinned at him cheekily.\n\u201cOi,\u201d Sirius tugged at her to reclaim her attention, \u201cI thought you were going to sit in the quidditch stands and do your homework?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I said I might,\u201d Mary squirmed free, \u201cBut it\u2019s bloomin\u2019 freezing out today, and Remus is really good at explaining--\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Sirius said, angrily, tossing his hair and crossing his arms. \u201cDo whatever you like, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\u201cOi, don\u2019t start with me, Mr Black.\u201d Mary frowned, \u201cYou\u2019ll lose, I promise.\u201d\nSirius did not look up. Mary put a hand on her hip, \u201cKiss me goodbye, then?\u201d\nSirius didn\u2019t move. Mary\u2019s face darkened. \u201cFine.\u201d She snapped, with a little stamp of her foot. \u201cI\u2019ll see you when I bloody well see you.\u201d And marched off.\nEveryone else at the table glanced around awkwardly, and now Remus was not the only one avoiding Sirius\u2019s eye. Fortunately, Sirius was, for once, in tune with the feelings of others, and stood up.\n\u201cSee you on the pitch.\u201d He muttered to James as he stalked out of the room, red robes swishing behind him.\n\u201cWell.\u201d Marlene said, \u201cCan\u2019t wait to hear about that for the next two weeks. Hope they make up soon.\u201d\nEveryone at the table agreed.\n* * *\n\u201cThe thing is,\u201d Mary said to Remus later on that evening, as she painted her fingernails a dark, wicked shade of red, \u201cSirius and I just both have such fiery personalities, y\u2019know? In\nWitch Weekly\n, it says that means our relationship is very passionate.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d Remus replied, trying to tune it out as he very purposefully began drawing out lines for his Astronomy chart.\n\u201cAnd obviously, passion is really good, in a relationship,\u201d she continued, blowing on her fingernails. \u201cI mean\u2026 it\u2019s really good, that side of things.\u201d She smiled to herself, in that awful, smug, satisfied,\nhappy\nway she always did when talking about Sirius. \u201cBut he needs to learn that I have my\nown\nlife, you know? I mean, it\u2019s the seventies!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, great.\u201d Remus nodded, not looking up.\n\u201cRemus?\u201d Christopher appeared at his side, \u201cAre you doing a star chart? Can I watch?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m really not that great at Astronomy, Chris,\u201d Remus replied, trying to concentrate on his lines, \u201cYou\u2019re better off just reading the text book\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh no, I bet you\u2019re\ngreat\n!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m really n\u2014\u201d\n\u201cRemus?\u201d Mary said, leaning over the desk, jogging his ruler, and smearing the tiniest fleck of red nail polish onto his parchment, \u201cAre you listening to me? I asked if you know\nwhy\nSirius\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLupin, Lupin!\u201d A third year came running out of the portrait hole, \u201cI lost your notes on unicorns, I\u2019m really sorry, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHiya Lupin, can I bum a fag?\u201d A sixth year appeared.\nRemus screwed up his face. A dull pain had started up behind his eyes.\n\u201cJust \u2013 can everybody please be quiet?!\u201d He said, much more brusquely than he meant to. He looked up and saw everyone staring at him, slightly wide eyed. \u201cEr\u2026 I\u2019ve got a headache, I\u2019m going for a lie down.\u201d He got up.\n\u201cOooh!\u201d Mary said, standing up too, \u201cYou can\u2019t! Sorry, Remus, but the lads are up there planning\u2026 er\u2026 I mean making\u2026 er\u2026 I mean\u2026\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cI was supposed to keep you down here\u2026\u201d\nRemus took a deep breath.\n\u201cOk. I\u2019ll go to the hospital wing, then.\u201d\nHe refused all offers to escort him, hurrying as quickly as possible, skull throbbing sickly with every step. It was no good, he would have to start being rude to people - for the sake of his own sanity, if nothing else. Since when had he become everyone's best friend, anyway? Wasn\u2019t he just the same scrawny, mean, care home brat he\u2019d always been?\nThe cool quiet of the sick bay was so soothing Remus could have burst into tears. As much as he usually felt very much at home in the warm red glow of the Gryffindor common room, it was in the still, soft greys of the hospital wing where Remus first remembered feeling truly peaceful at Hogwarts. He stood there enjoying it for a moment, eyes closed. If he could just stay here all night.\n\u201cHello, Remus dear,\u201d Madam Pomfrey smiled, coming out of her office, \u201cEverything all right?\u201d\n\u201cI er\u2026\u201d\nOh no. He really was going to cry. He swallowed helplessly, and raised a fist to his forehead.\n\u201cRemus?\u201d The nurse came over a little quicker, her brow creasing with concern. She was still just a bit taller than him, but they were eye to eye, pretty much.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he gasped, his voice tight and strange as he fought back tears, \u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 I\u2019ve got a headache.\u201d\n\u201cSit down,\u201d Madam Pomfrey said gently, motioning to the nearest armchair, by an unoccupied bed. \u201cI\u2019ve just the thing.\u201d\nShe summoned a little pewter vial from her office. It flew into her palm and she uncorked it and gave it to him. \u201cHave two good glugs of that \u2013 don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s nice and sweet.\u201d Her eye twinkled a little.\nRemus downed the potion, and felt all of the tension and pain leave his neck and head at once, like water washing away.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he ducked his head, his voice was still thick. \u201cSorry. Bit of an overreaction.\u201d\n\u201cDear Remus,\u201d Madam Pomfrey clucked, \u201cI\u2019ve known you for five years now, and not once have you ever overreacted. Are you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, better now, thanks.\u201d\n\u201cI mean\u2026 in general?\u201d She pressed, \u201cI\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve been burning the candle at both ends \u2013 doing long hours in the library \u2013 and you have your prefect duties, and your\u2026 well, your health.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Remus rubbed his eyes fiercely. \u201cHonestly. Just\u2026 maybe just tired. I\u2019ll go to bed now.\u201d\n\u201cHappy birthday, Remus,\u201d the medi-witch said, as he got up to leave.\n\u201cCheers.\u201d He nodded, politely. But then she did something very strange. She reached out and hugged him. Very tightly, and not for very long. It was lovely.\n\u201cTake care of yourself.\u201d She said, as he left.\nHe walked back slowly, and wished he had an invisibility cloak for it. He could do without Severus following him, or having to break up a hexing match between two very inept first years. When he finally reached the portrait hole up to Gryffindor Tower, he really did fancy an early night. But of course, the marauders had other plans.\n\u201cHAPPY BIRTHDAY REMUS!\u201d The entire common room exploded, as soon as he appeared.\nThey\u2019d done an incredible job. There were streamers hanging from every rafter, portrait and picture rail \u2013 and confetti liberally sprinkled over everything else. Students and friends of Remus\u2019s from every house and year group grinned back at him, a flock of real live fairies fluttering over their heads. The tables were laden with sandwiches, cakes, pasties and pastries, as well as a huge bowl of very suspicious looking punch.\nHe smiled as widely as he could as he entered the room,\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d He said, hoping he was doing a good \u2018surprised\u2019 face, \u201cYou lot are crazy!\u201d\nThey laughed, and eagerly ushered him into the room, where he found himself surrounded by cheers and pats on the back and birthday wishes. The record player began to blare, and Remus\u2019s sixteenth birthday party began in earnest.\n\u201cI think this is bigger than Sirius\u2019s party,\u201d James said, handing Remus a cup of the purplish looking punch, \u201cDon\u2019t tell him I said that, though.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why all these people are here\u2026\u201d Remus replied, staring around amazed. Everyone from every one of his classes; his study group \u2013 some people he\u2019d only spoken to a few times before.\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re\nMoony\n, obviously. The acceptable face of the marauders.\u201d James nudged him. \u201cWow, look at Evans\u2026\u201d\nLily did look lovely, in a deep maroon mini skirt and high wedge sandals. She was dancing with Marlene and Mary in a little group of three, laughing and raising her hands above her head.\n\u201cPlease tell me someone\u2019s confiscated your broom tonight.\u201d Remus said to James, who laughed good naturedly.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not planning to get\nthat\ndrunk again any time soon. I\u2019m going to try playing hard to get tonight.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019ll appreciate that.\u201d Remus replied.\nHe scanned the room for Sirius, who seemed to be missing. There was Peter, cosied up in an armchair with Desdemona. There was Christopher, having a very earnest conversation with a third year Ravenclaw girl, occasionally glancing up to smile at Remus. The rest of the Gryffindor quidditch team were huddled around the punch, challenging each other to down stronger and stronger measures. No Sirius.\nJames must have seen him looking.\n\u201cHe\u2019s moping somewhere, over Mary.\u201d He explained, \u201cI told him if he can\u2019t cheer the fuck up then he\u2019s not to come down here bringing everyone else down. I\u2019ve taken him a few drinks up, but it\u2019s not working.\u201d\n\u201cOh right. Still haven\u2019t made up, then?\u201d Remus watched Mary, still dancing, who had caught the eye of almost every boy in the room.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like it. I thought maybe tough love would help, but I\u2019m not as good at it as you. So he\u2019s sulking. Don\u2019t mind him though, Moony, enjoy your party!\u201d\nHe did try to. The cake Mrs Potter had sent was glorious \u2013 heavy, rich chocolate with white icing and multi-coloured hundreds and thousands. The candles were enchanted to burn all evening without dripping wax, and only went out for a few moments after Remus blew on them. He did\nnot\ndance, though Marlene and Lily tried to drag him up a few times, but he did mingle, thanking people for coming, and having quite a nice chat with the seventh years about which NEWTs to take.\n\u201cYou should be a teacher.\u201d One of them said, which Remus thought was very kind, but completely insane.\nIt must have been getting close to midnight when he patted his back pocket for his pack of cigarettes, and found them missing. Sighing, he considered leaving it \u2013 but he had had enough to drink now, and just really wanted a smoke more than anything. There was still a box in the bottom of his trunk, if Sirius hadn\u2019t pinched them. He decided to go and look.\nHalfway up the stairs, he bumped into James again.\n\u201cSorry, Moony,\u201d the black-haired boy said, looking a bit drunk and a bit annoyed. \u201cHe\u2019s coming down, now.\u201d\nRemus looked over James\u2019s shoulder to see a sullen faced Sirius following him down the stairs.\n\u201cNot going to bed, are you?\u201d James asked.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Remus shook his head, almost struck dumb, \u201cFags.\u201d\n\u201cFilthy habit.\u201d James said with a wonky smirk. He glanced over his shoulder, \u201cC\u2019mon then, Black.\u201d\n\u201cJust a sec,\u201d Sirius said, looking at Remus, \u201cI just want to say happy birthday to Moony.\u201d\n\u201cFine, but hurry up.\u201d James said, slurring, \u201cRemus, tell him to swallow his stupid bloody pride and get down there and snog Mary, eh?\u201d\n\u201cOk, Prongs.\u201d\nJames pushed the door open, and for a few seconds light and noise invaded the staircase, before muting again as he closed the door behind him. Sirius and Remus were alone.\n\u201cHappy birthday, Moony.\u201d Sirius said, coming down a few steps to stand level with Remus.\n\u201cCheers,\u201d Remus smiled, as casually as he could. \u201cYou er\u2026 you ok?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, fine.\u201d Sirius said, though it was clearly a lie. He was fiddling with an empty cup. \u201cSorry if I ruined your party.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t. It\u2019s been great.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d\nQuiet. Sirius looked down, then up at Remus again. \u201cJames reckons I need to be the one to go and make up with Mary.\u201d\n\u201cProbably a good idea.\u201d\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026 yeah?\u201d Remus was confused. \u201cYou\u2026 um. You like Mary, I thought.\u201d\nSirius shrugged, looking at Remus again, his eyes dark blue, flecked with sharp, icy silver. His lips were shiny and red from drinking, and he had that slightly petulant look he got when he wasn\u2019t smiling. Remus almost wanted to look away, he was so gorgeous. It couldn\u2019t be right, staring at each other like that. It couldn\u2019t possibly end well.\n\u201cI do like Mary.\u201d Sirius said, leaning forward slightly. Remus could feel his breath on his skin.\n\u201cSo go and snog her then, silly prat.\u201d Remus said, hurriedly, trying to step back but bumping against the wall behind him. It really was such a stupidly narrow stairway - like the broom cupboard all over again.\n\u201cI will,\u201d Sirius said, biting his lip slightly.\nOh god\n, Remus thought. \u201cI will, in a minute.\u201d\nRemus swallowed.\n\u201cHave you ever kissed anyone, Remus?\u201d\n\u201cNo, you know I haven\u2019t.\u201d The lie came easily now.\nSirius nodded, looking at him again, that forward, knowing look.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not as scary as you think it is.\u201d Sirius said.\nRemus couldn\u2019t bear it.\nHe might never know what came over him in that moment. It was all just\ntoo much\nand he grabbed the back of the other boy\u2019s neck and pulled him forward, pressing his lips hard against Sirius\u2019s. It was terrifying \u2013 and amazing. Even more so when Sirius began kissing him back, opening his lips and allowing Remus to slide his tongue inside. It was all at once startling, incredible, and familiar. He couldn't think \u2013 as if every transmitter in his brain had short circuited at once, fizzing and popping; sending off sparks.\nYes\n, was the only coherent thought he had;\nyes yes yes yes\n.\nThey came to their senses simultaneously, both pulling away. Remus snatched back his hand, Sirius stared at him wide-eyed. Remus looked away first.\n\u201cI\u2019d better\u2014\u201d Sirius started back towards the common room,\n\u201c\u2014Yeah, I was just\u2026\u201d Remus backed away, up the stairs.\nSirius disappeared back towards the party and Remus exhaled deeply, feeling he might sink to the floor. He ran his fingers through his hair and wiped his mouth. He rubbed his eyes and fought the urge to punch the wall. What had he been playing at?! Sirius would think he was completely mad \u2013 or worse. He\u2019d never done anything like that before. Maybe he was mad.\nHe had to say sorry. He had to make it right, before Sirius told James \u2013 before they all\nknew\n.\nRemus straightened his shirt and headed down the stairs, hoping to catch up with Sirius to apologise \u2013 to somehow explain. He re-entered the common room, still vibrant with light and music, and saw something that made him stop still. He shrank back, unable to look away.\nSirius was snogging Mary.\nHe had her pushed up against the marble mantelpiece, and she looked like she was pushing back against him with equal ferocity, their bodies pressed together, heads bobbing. Her arms were slung around his neck, her thin dark fingers curling in his hair. Everyone cheered and hooted merrily.\nRemus turned on his heel and marched straight back to the tower. He ignored James and Peter, who were planning to head to the kitchens for more supplies. He just shook his head, mute, and carried on up the stairs to their bedroom. He drew the curtains around his bed closed and lay down, feeling strange.\nHe covered his face with his arms and thought about the two of them together. He thought about Sirius\u2019 eyes and the curve of Mary\u2019s hips until he fell into a fitful sleep."

            "content": "Thursday 11\nth\nMarch 1976\n\nHello, Grant.\n\nWotcher, Remus.\n\nHow are you?\n\n\nHow am I? How are\nyou\n, you silly twat; you\u2019re the one having a made up conversation with me.\n\n\nYeah, sorry about that.\n\nS\u2019ok, I\u2019m not busy. I\u2019m not even real.\n\nYou\nare\nreal, I just can\u2019t talk to you in real life. I don\u2019t know where you are, even.\n\nNuffin\u2019 I can do about that. What\u2019s up?\n\nI kissed Sirius.\n\nBloody hell.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nHow should I know? Didn\u2019t I tell you not to?\n\nYeah, but. He kissed me back. For a minute, at least.\n\nSure you\u2019re not just imagining that?\n\nYeah...\n\nRemus gave up at that point. He had been lying awake in bed since at least five o\u2019clock in the morning, alternately panicking and soaring with joy. He had to be mad. Mental. Crazy. Bonkers. Lost it. He\u2019d thought that talking to someone else might help - but who could you talk to that early in the morning? Especially when it concerned a secret which could very well get you expelled, for all Remus knew.\nUnable to find a solution by talking to an imaginary person (or at least an imagined version of a real person), he returned to his previous, somewhat less constructive diversion \u2013 trying to relive the three minutes on the staircase with Sirius last night\nwithout\nreliving the part where they both ran away from each other.\nDid he regret it? It was too soon to tell. On the one hand, Remus might well have just ruined the best friendship he had ever had \u2013 or ever would have. On the other hand, it had been a bloody good snog.\nIn Remus\u2019s limited experience, he thought it probably made sense that just because you really madly fancied someone, it didn\u2019t mean that when you finally kissed them it would be as good as you\u2019d imagined. And Remus knew he had a very vivid imagination sometimes \u2013 but Sirius was\nSirius\n. It had been anything but disappointing. It had been perfect, in fact.\nAs long as you pretended that last part hadn\u2019t happened.\nStifling a groan, he scolded himself and tried to think rationally.\nApproach it like an essay\n, he thought.\nLay out all the facts, then make your argument\n.\nSo, the facts:\na. Remus Lupin had kissed Sirius Black full on the lips.\nb. Sirius Black had not immediately thrown a punch.\nc. Sirius Black had actually kissed Remus Lupin back (despite what the imaginary Grant had to say)\nd. Sirius Black had also kissed Mary MacDonald, immediately afterwards, and with considerable vigour.\ne. Sirius Black had not come to bed. At all.\nBollocks. Shitting buggering bollocks.\nRemus climbed out of bed, it was no good lying there tossing and turning. He had to get out of the tower. Sirius\u2019s bed lay empty to his left. If he wasn\u2019t in it, then he was most likely in the common room. To be safe, Remus took James\u2019s cloak.\nHe was good at being quiet and moving without a sound, but he needn\u2019t have worried. Sirius was dead to the world \u2013 he lay on the couch, head flung back, the perfect line of his jaw exposed. Mary was curled up against his chest, a patchwork quilt thrown over the two of them. Remus hurried past, wanting to get as far away as possible.\nThe prefect\u2019s bathroom was probably one of the weirdest parts of the castle. Remus had thought the older students were teasing him, when they gave out the password in the train back in September. He went once, and once only, in the first term, but couldn\u2019t get past the thought of actually removing all of his clothes in such a big open room. What if someone came in?\nHowever, on this particular morning it was the only place he was sure he would not be found \u2013 even if the marauders decided to use the map; they couldn\u2019t come and find him without the password.\nHe reached the fourth floor and whispered, \u201csqueaky clean\u201d at the entrance before slipping in. No one was in there; it was much too early. He had often wondered whether there was some kind of mechanism in place to stop anyone else from getting in while you were in the bath \u2013 he had so far seen no evidence of this and decided to play it safe.\nStripping down to his boxers and vest, Remus ran the water, and pumped a lot of bubbles into the Olympic swimming pool sized bathtub before sliding in, still in his underthings. The bathroom was one of the most beautiful rooms in the castle, Remus acknowledged. Everything was clean white marble and glimmering golden taps. The stained-glass windows depicted a series of gorgeous, shimmering sea creatures. A lovely tangerine smell was rising from the great white drifts of foam, and Remus finally began to relax.\nHe had never learnt how to swim \u2013 the St Edmund\u2019s boys were offered lessons down at the local swimming baths for free, but Matron wouldn\u2019t let him go. He hadn\u2019t minded \u2013 he didn\u2019t want the other boys to see his scars. But now he was older, he thought he\u2019d like to learn. Sirius had once talked about family holidays in the south of France, where the sea was warm enough to bathe in. Remus couldn\u2019t imagine that. The only sea he\u2019d ever seen was at Southend \u2013 and once Margate. It was bloody freezing, a dirty grey-green colour. Not the crystal azure Sirius had described.\nStill, Remus could float. He lay on his back and stared up at the chambered ceiling.\n\nHaving fun?\n\nNot really.\n\nSo, if he kissed you back, and then ran off and kissed Mary, where does that leave things?\n\nI don\u2019t know, do I?! That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to help me figure out!\n\nAlright, alright, calm your tits.\n\nYou don\u2019t say that. Sirius says that.\n\nLook, I\u2019m doing my best. I told you, I\u2019m not even real.\n\nMaybe I was a really bad kisser.\n\nMaybe.\n\nThe real Grant is a lot nicer than you, you know.\n\n\nYeah, well whose fault is that?\nYou\u2019re\nthe one talking to yourself, you nutter. Find someone real to talk to.\n\n\nRemus sighed, frowning. Could you be a bad kisser and not know it? Probably. He didn\u2019t have enough experience to know. It hadn\u2019t felt bad \u2013 it had felt like they fit.\n\nHe kissed me back.\n\nRemus knew, deep down, that it had nothing to do with how he\u2019d done it. It was the very fact that he\u2019d done it at all.\nHe knew it \u2013 but he wasn\u2019t ready to address it yet. Not even with an imaginary person. If he was being thoroughly truthful, Remus knew that Sirius had every right to run away \u2013 to be shocked, confused or even frightened. And there was a mad kind of Sirius Black logic behind snogging the very first honest-to-goodness girl he could find, right after something like that.\nOnce again, Remus was confronted with the image of Sirius pressing Mary up against the mantelpiece, those hands on her waist that had been on his waist, only moments before\u2026 and he kicked, involuntarily, forgetting to stay afloat.\nSpluttering and choking as he went under, Remus scrabbled back to the surface and came up coughing, orange hued foam going everywhere.\n\u201cRemus, is that you?!\u201d A girl\u2019s voice echoed across the bathroom floor.\nHe struggled to wipe his hair out of his face, blinking, and just made out the blurry outline of Lily Evans in a pink quilted dressing gown. He rubbed his eyes, hard, his feet finding the floor, and choked out,\n\u201cHiya, Lily.\u201d\n\u201cChrist, are you ok? Thought I\u2019d have to dive in and save you there!\u201d\n\u201cLost my balance.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you beat me to a bath, I thought I\u2019d be the first up. Got a filthy headache.\u201d Lily rubbed her forehead with a pained expression.\n\u201cYeah, that punch was pretty strong,\u201d Remus replied, though he felt fine. \u201cI was just getting out\u2026 er\u2026 do you mind turning around?\u201d\n\u201cOh, ok, sorry!\u201d Lily smiled, turning her back.\nRemus moved to the side and pulled himself up out of the warm water with some reluctance. He felt silly and girlish, asking her not to look \u2013 James or Sirius probably wouldn\u2019t care at all. Grabbing a towel, he wrapped it around himself, over his shoulders, rather than around his waist. That wasn\u2019t exactly manly, either, but he didn\u2019t need Evans asking about his scars on top of everything else.\n\u201cOk.\u201d He said, hurrying into a changing cubicle.\nHe heard Lily running the taps again, and a sweet lavender smell filled the room as he dried off and changed into his uniform.\n\u201cSo where did you disappear to last night?\u201d Lily called, over the noise of running water, \u201cWe must have gone on \u2018til at least two. Potter was so pissed.\u201d\n\u201cMust have got a bit too drunk,\u201d Remus called back, \u201cWent to bed at midnight.\u201d\n\u201cLightweight!\u201d Lily teased. He heard the taps go off, and a soft splash as she got in the bath. \u201cStill,\u201d she carried on, \u201cAt least Sirius and Mary made up, eh?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that was lucky.\u201d He replied, evenly, exiting his stall.\nLily was bobbing about at the far end of the pool, her red hair piled up on top of her head, surrounded by a sea of purple foam. She smiled at him.\n\u201cLibrary.\u201d He said, feeling awkward and clammy, fully dressed in the warm, steamy bathroom.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she laughed, \u201cWhere else? Oh, did you see that notice in the common room?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he shook his head. He had not looked at anything but Sirius in the common room.\n\u201cCareer meetings with McGonagall have been posted \u2013 mid-April.\u201d\n\u201cOh good,\u201d Remus felt his limbs grow heavy, \u201cThanks.\u201d\nIt was a relief to be out of the hot bathroom, and rather than the library, Remus decided to go outside for a bit. To the greenhouses and back, maybe. There were sometimes a few Hufflepuffs hanging around there dealing pot, and even though it was a school day, and he hadn\u2019t even had breakfast yet, this seemed like a very good idea.\n\nThis is all your fault, you know.\n\nHow\u2019s that?\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t snogged me last summer, I\u2019d still be\u2026\n\nOblivious? Confused?\n\nNormal.\n\nThat\u2019s a bloody lie and you know it. Wanting to get your end away is the only normal thing about you.\n\nFair enough.\n\nYou\u2019re glad I snogged you. You bloody loved it.\n\n...Yeah.\n\n\nYou\u2019re only annoyed because Sirius didn\u2019t react the way\nyou\ndid.\n\n\n...Yeah\u2026\n\nThe question is \u2013 why the bloody hell would you expect Sirius to act anything like you?\n\nWhy indeed.\nThis was the first bit of useful advice imaginary Grant had dredged up, and Remus clung to it. Sirius needed to do whatever it was Sirius needed to do. It wasn\u2019t for Remus to decide. He congratulated himself on being very mature about this whole thing. After all, he thought, at least it\u2019s done now. At least you know what it\u2019s like. Could you survive forever, he wondered, on one kiss?\nFortunately, there were indeed three Hufflepuffs sitting on the grass behind the greenhouses, two girls and a boy. They smiled at him in that friendly, stupid way that told him they had started early, and in slow and gentle tomes congratulated him on the excellent party. He sat with them until he couldn\u2019t ignore his hunger pangs any more, and staggered back to the castle dizzily for breakfast.\n\u201cHere he is!\u201d James boomed, as Remus took his place at the table.\nPeter, who had his head in his hands and looked a bit green around the gills groaned,\n\u201cNot so bloody\nloud\n, Prongs, I\u2019m begging you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, eat your eggs, you\u2019ll feel better.\u201d James grinned. Remus piled up his own plate with two fried eggs, two sausages, a pile of baked beans, three slices of toast, two slices of fried tomato and three rashers of bacon. He felt very calm and comfortable now. He could tell himself it had been the bath. But obviously not.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re hungover, or it\u2019s just that incredible metabolism of yours.\u201d Marlene grimaced at his plate.\n\u201cBit of both.\u201d Remus shrugged, tucking in.\n\u201cAnd something else,\u201d James wagged his finger, \u201cBeen down at the greenhouses already, Moony? Is this how you want to enter your seventeenth year?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Remus said, mouth full.\nSirius was there, of course, but he hadn\u2019t said anything yet. He was propping his head up sleepily on one elbow, nursing a large mug of milky tea. Remus stared at him intently, willing him to look up, but he didn\u2019t. Mary was nowhere to be seen.\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s being a wimp,\u201d Marlene explained, \u201cPulling a sickie, even though everyone saw her down an entire bottle of Witches Brew by herself.\u201d\n\u201cShe did?\u201d Remus said, \u201cWow, impressive, she probably deserves a lie in then.\u201d He meant it sincerely.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all feeling rough, though,\u201d Marlene said, \u201cEvans was chucking up for at least an hour before bed.\u201d\n\u201cIs she ok?!\u201d James asked, scandalised.\n\u201cYeah, I saw her this morning in the prefect\u2019s bathroom.\u201d Remus said, swallowing his mouthful. \u201cShe\u2019s ok.\u201d\n\u201cIn the bathroom, eh?\u201d James raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop your philandering ways, Remus, give the rest of us a chance.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s me,\u201d Remus snorted, \u201cThe Casanova of Gryffindor Tower\u2026\u201d\nHe\u2019d only said it to make James laugh, but Sirius\u2019s head finally snapped up, his eyes resting on Remus. There was a tiny, almost imperceptible frown, knitting his brow. He looked at Remus as if he was an incantation he hadn\u2019t yet worked out how to pronounce. Remus looked back, steadily, allowing this scrutiny \u2013 he would allow Sirius anything. Another moment and it was over. Sirius looked away, saying nothing."

            "content": "So messed up, I want you here\n\nIn my room, I want you here\n\nNow we're gonna be face-to-face\n\nAnd I'll lay right down in my favourite place\n\nAnd now I want to be your dog\n\nNow I want to be your dog\n\nNow I want to be your dog\n\nWell, come on\u2026\n\nTuesday 16th March 1976\nBy the time the next full moon arrived, it became clear that Remus and Sirius had reached a stalemate. Remus had tried being indirect \u2013 catching Sirius\u2019s eye during meals, or the rare evenings they were all together. He tried hanging back in the dorm room to see if Sirius would stay behind too. But no luck. Sirius\u2019s eyes never met his, and he was always the first to leave a room with Remus in it.\nShort of actually ambushing Sirius somewhere (which he refused to do), Remus was running out of options. The plea for another phone call with Grant was returned, with a note in Matron\u2019s neat, brutally clear handwriting on the envelope. \u2018\nRecipient no longer known at this address\n\u2019. He was completely alone.\nOnce, Remus thought he\u2019d got close to catching Sirius. They were leaving Charms, and James had stopped back to talk to Professor Flitwick, and Peter had nipped to the loo, so Remus and Sirius found themselves waiting alone in a busy corridor. He seized the chance, saying quietly,\n\u201cLook, about the other night--\u201d\n\u201cYeah, we were all so pissed, right?!\u201d Sirius laughed, loudly \u2013 loud enough for people to turn and look. \u201cMental. Can hardly remember half of it!\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 yeah, right.\u201d Remus withdrew.\nIt was a complete lie, they both knew that. But it was one of those awful cases where neither of them were supposed to\nacknowledge\nthe lie; just keep stepping over it. You couldn\u2019t push Sirius any further than he was willing to go. And he was clearly not willing to go\u2026\nthere\n.\nThen, of course, there was Mary. If Sirius\ndid\nwant Remus in the same way Remus wanted Sirius, then surely the Mary thing would be over. But no, Remus was going to have to come to terms with the fact that it wasn\u2019t \u2018the Mary thing\u2019; it was his best friend\u2019s relationship, and it wasn\u2019t going anywhere any time soon. She was everywhere he was, and more often than not on his lap.\nDuring this time, Remus briefly flirted with the idea of leglimency. Being able to read Sirius\u2019s mind was very appealing. He soon gave up, finding it much more difficult than anything else he\u2019d ever attempted. Plus, with his revision schedule now in full swing, he had very little room in his head for new spells.\nNow, on the night of the full moon, Remus sat alone in the Shrieking Shack, waiting for his friends to arrive and not sure if they would be two or three. He was getting a bit paranoid, actually, but that wasn't Sirius\u2019s fault. In an attempt at escapism, Remus had been spending more and more time down at the greenhouses, spacing out and filling up with dozy green smoke. Not ideal. Better than drinking, he supposed. Better than getting detentions for stupid pranks.\nHe\u2019d smoked that particular day to calm his nerves around the moon \u2013 and to see if it had any effect on the transformation pains. Though goodness only knew what a stoned werewolf would be like.\nA sharp pain seared his shoulder blades, and he gasped with surprise. Well, that was that experiment done with.\n\u201cEvening Moony,\u201d the door opened and James poked his head around.\n\u201cIt\u2019s starting,\u201d Remus clenched his jaw, \u201cHurry up, get in.\u201d\nJames quickly transformed, and was followed into the room by a large brown rat and a big black dog. Remus closed his eyes, relieved.\nThe night of the full moon was no different from any other they\u2019d had so far. As animals, they were less conscious, or perhaps just less concerned by their more human problems. The wolf only wanted to run, and hunt, to roll about in the undergrowth and chase the black one and playfight the big one.\nThe next morning, he felt refreshed and invigorated \u2013 or at least he would have if it weren\u2019t for the bone crushing agony of returning to human form. Some things never changed. The marauders crept out, only twenty minutes or so before Madam Pomfrey appeared to take Remus back to school. In the hospital wing, she gave him his usual deep sleep potion and he did not open his eyes until well after midday. This was always going to be a problem, he had realised lately. No matter how much his monthly transformations had been improved, he still lost so much time.\nHe\u2019d already checked, and found that the May full moon did not coincide with any exams. This seemed very odd to him, until he realised that it must have been orchestrated this way, by Dumbledore or McGonagall. He found that a bit embarrassing. Didn\u2019t they know he had sat through classes before with his blood boiling and his muscles aching? That he had finished essays after being up for two days, head throbbing and so tired he only had adrenaline left for fuel? And he had still beaten half the class. He could\ndo\nit. They just had to let him. How would he ever get a job after school if he couldn\u2019t be seen to be keeping up?\nWhen Remus opened his eyes at about four o\u2019clock, he was very surprised to see Sirius there. alone.\n\u201cMorning,\u201d he smiled, softly, a trace of anxiety still clinging to his features. That might not be because of Remus \u2013 Sirius was often anxious, these days. If Snape was Remus\u2019s malevolent shadow, then Regulus was Sirius\u2019s. It seemed even if you left the Black family in everything but name, you were never really free of the sense of obligation. Or the guilt. That could be the case with all families, Remus reflected. He wouldn\u2019t know.\n\u201cMorning,\u201d he nodded back, pulling himself up. \u201cGood night, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, great,\u201d Sirius nodded, eager for some familiar territory. \u201cCan\u2019t believe we found that waterfall, Prongs reckons there\u2019s a cave behind it. Told him if there is, then a troll probably lives there. They like caves, don\u2019t they?\u201d\n\u201cThey do, yeah.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t awkward, exactly. They chatted like this all the time. But they didn\u2019t usually struggle to keep a conversation going. Quite the opposite, in fact. Sirius was looking at the ceiling, when out of the blue he said,\n\u201cWe\u2019re ok, aren\u2019t we, Moony?\u201d His voice was small.\n\u201c\u2018course.\u201d Remus said, hurriedly.\n\u201cBecause you - You, James, Pete. You\u2019re my best mates.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. You\u2019re my best mate. You all are.\u201d\n\u201cOk good.\u201d Sirius look relieved, and Remus was glad he\u2019d said the right thing. But his face seemed to grow troubled again. \u201cThere\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s Mary, just now, too.\u201d\n\u201cMary.\u201d Remus repeated.\n\u201cYeah, I said I\u2019d go and meet her. Pete\u2019ll be along in a bit.\u201d\n\u201cNo, its fine. Once Madam Pomfrey\u2019s back she\u2019ll probably let me out. I\u2019ll\u2026 see you this evening?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d Sirius grinned, looking more comfortable than he had in weeks.\nWe understand each other, now\n. \u201cSee you at dinner, mate.\u201d He said this last word with an overly jocular blokeyness that was very unlike him. Remus was surprised he didn\u2019t punch him on the arm, or knuckle his hair.\n* * *\nWednesday 14th April 1976\nThe next month passed in a blur of quills, books and parchment. Remus couldn\u2019t be sure whether or not he and Sirius were still at odds, because he simply didn\u2019t have the time to worry about it. When they did see each other - in lessons, in the corridors, or yawning goodnight to each other before bed \u2013 everything seemed perfectly fine.\nRemus\u2019s study group had doubled in size, until he had to break them up by different subjects for each day of the week. The sessions mostly took the form of running through past written papers from previous years, sharing their answers, pointing out key extracts from their various textbooks. Remus felt that he was learning just as much as he was teaching \u2013 and he was really enjoying it.\n\u201cHow come you\u2019re not in Ravenclaw?\u201d Christopher asked, one day, as he helped Remus tidy up the disused classroom where they\u2019d been practicing levitation. It was a mess.\n\u201cMy dad was, actually,\u201d Remus smiled softly. That didn\u2019t hurt as much as it used to. There were other things, more important. \u201cAnd the hat did mention it at my sorting, but\u2026 not to be.\u201d\n\u201cSeems like you would have been better off there.\u201d Christopher said, repairing a shattered inkwell and cleaning up the black puddle beneath.\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Remus shrugged, \u201cIf you\u2019d known me then you wouldn\u2019t think so.\u201d\nThey finished this job and Remus glanced at the clock. \u201cShit, I have to go\u2026 sorry, Chris, will you be ok getting back to the Tower?\u201d\n\u201cPureblood privilege,\u201d Christopher said, making a face, \u201cI don\u2019t get bothered. Where\u2019re you going?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 it\u2019s private. Sorry. Thanks for the help!\u201d\nHe had to run, in the end, to get to the hospital wing in time. Madam Pomfrey scolded him lightly,\n\u201cNo physical exercise on full moons!\u201d She said, fastening her cloak, \u201cYou\u2019ll get yourself agitated, and we\u2019ve had such a good year.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he waved a hand, a little too casually. Maybe he ought to get Prongs to scratch him up a bit, so that she didn\u2019t get suspicious. No way would Prongs do it, though.\nThey began to walk out into the grounds together, a journey so familiar now they could do it in their sleep. \u201cI could do this bit on my own, now,\u201d he said, conversationally, \u201cI know how it all works well enough. You\u2019d only need to get me in the mornings, then.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, dear,\u201d she shook her head, \u201cDumbledore\u2019s orders. I\u2019m to make sure you\u2019re safely off the grounds on time.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Of course.\u201d He tried not to sound ungrateful. Of course, that was a concern \u2013 that he might forget, or run late. Then what? It would be much worse than this, he thought, once he turned seventeen and had to register with the ministry.\nInside the Shack, Madam Pomfrey shrieked,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?!\u201d Remus withdrew his wand.\n\u201cOh, nothing,\u201d she clutched her chest, \u201cI\u2026 I saw a rat. Horrible things. Sorry, dear, I wish we could find a nicer place for you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s fine\u2026 see you in the morning.\u201d\nWhen the door close, he spun around, \u201cPete? Was that you?\u201d\n\u201c... Sorry, Moony,\u201d Peter\u2019s voice came from upstairs. \u201cI was supposed to be keeping guard\u2026\u201d\nHe came down the staircase, followed by Sirius and James, who were yawning, and looked as though they\u2019d just woken up.\n\u201cWhat are you two doing here?!\u201d Remus asked, surprised, \u201cWhat about the match?!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been sleeping since the final bell,\u201d James explained, \u201cThen we\u2019ll get another hour or two\u2019s kip in the morning\u2026 and lunchtime, if we can swing it.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re mental.\u201d Remus shook his head, \u201cBoth of you.\u201d He looked at Sirius, to check if they were still playing the eye contact game.\n\u201cAnything for our Moony.\u201d Sirius said, holding his gaze for a good few seconds before dropping it, looking away and rubbing his arm. This satisfied Remus, though he knew he ought to feel guilty. He didn\u2019t know why he took so much pleasure in watching Sirius squirm.\n\u201cWe\u2019re early,\u201d Peter said, sitting on Remus\u2019s little cot, \u201cAren\u2019t we, Remus?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I think so,\u201d he stretched a little bit, to get a feel for his various aches and twinges, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m a way off.\u201d\n\u201cOh, good, can I go back to sleep?\u201d Sirius yawned. He and James had settled themselves on the floor, and Sirius was resting his head on James\u2019s shoulder.\nFuck you, James\n, Remus thought, before stopping himself. He leaned against the wall, self-consciously.\n\u201cOi, when\u2019s your appointment with McGonagall?\u201d James asked, shrugging his shoulder to shake Sirius off.\n\u201cErr\u2026 First thing next Friday I think. Why?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you going to say?\u201d\n\u201cSay?\u201d\n\u201cAbout careers, idiot.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right,\u201d Sirius stifled another yawn, his eyes watering with tiredness. \u201cUgh, I dunno. Don\u2019t really fancy the idea of a job, much. Father wanted me to go into politics, so I s\u2019pose\u2026 not that.\u201d\n\u201cMy mum says it\u2019s a bad time to join the ministry,\u201d Peter said, thoughtfully. \u201cBut Dezzie reckons it\u2019s the best time - when the war\u2019s over we\u2019ll be in on the ground floor to rebuild.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s one way of looking at it.\u201d Sirius raised an eyebrow. He nudged James, \u201cGo on then, tell us what your plans are.\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d James looked at him, innocently.\n\u201cOh, come\non\nPotter, don\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t got it all laid out in front of you. Puddlemere? Holyhead? The Cannons? Who\u2019s shown the most interest so far?\u201d\n\u201cActually,\u201d James raised his head in a very dignified way, \u201cIf you must know, they\u2019ve\nall\ninquired, according to McGonagall. But I\u2019m turning them down \u2013 for now, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah? Going to have a gap year and live off your Sleek-ezy millions?\u201d\n\u201cNo, you git. I\u2019m going to fight.\u201d\nThere was a weird sort of pause. Sirius looked deeply troubled. Remus broke it.\n\u201cYou what, mate?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d James looked uncharacteristically nervous about this, \u201cThe war won\u2019t end unless people fight it. Mum and dad are working so hard and\u2026 well I couldn\u2019t be any kind of son, if I didn\u2019t help, would I? Dumbledore needs as many people as he can get. Plus,\u201d he laughed, shakily, \u201cIf Wormy wants a job at the ministry, we\u2019d better make sure the ministry is still standing, right?\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026 when you speak to McGonagall, you\u2019ll say\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat quidditch can wait? That I want to do everything I can to make sure the wizarding world is safe for everyone, not just purebloods? Yeah, pretty much.\u201d James ended, simply, looking down at his hands.\nQuiet again. Finally, Sirius muttered,\n\u201cThen that\u2019s what I\u2019ll say too.\u201d\n\u201cMate, you don\u2019t have to...\u201d\n\u201cWhat else am I going to do? Retire with my uncle\u2019s inheritance and let you have all the fun? Piss off.\u201d\n\u201cMe too!\u201d Peter said suddenly, eager to be included, \u201cI can help!\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Course you can,\u201d James beamed, \u201cYou\u2019re a marauder, that\u2019s basically the best qualification you can have.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you, Moony?\u201d Peter gabbled, excited and bright eyed.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to\u2026mmph\u201d\nToo late, here it comes,\n\u201cShit \u2013 change! Quick!\u201d\nThey all leapt up ready to take their animal forms.\nThe last thing Remus saw clearly was his three friends, standing together, thinking about their futures."

            "content": "Friday 23rd April 1976\n\u201cGood afternoon, Mr Lupin,\u201d Professor McGonagall smiled as he entered her office.\n\u201cGood afternoon, Professor.\u201d He replied politely, sitting on the chair opposite her desk.\n\u201cAll ready for your exams?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 I think so.\u201d\n\u201cI have every faith in you,\u201d she smiled - McGonagall\u2019s smile was given only when she felt the situation deserved it. For this reason, Remus smiled back.\nThe middle-aged witch looked down at a pile of parchment smoothed out before her. Notes from his other professors, perhaps. She cleared her throat, looked up, and smiled again, \u201cYou have received consistently strong results during your time at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\u201cNot the whole time,\u201d he murmured, thinking of those wasted months in first year.\n\u201cYou are a prefect,\u201d McGonagall continued, \u201cA generally well-behaved, thoughtful young man. You seem to excel in your Charm work, and History, and I hear you have even gathered some pupils of your own?\u201d\n\u201cI just don\u2019t mind helping out,\u201d he explained, embarrassed. \u201cIf people get stuck.\u201d\n\u201cAn admirable quality, Mr Lupin.\u201d\n\u201cEr... thanks.\u201d\n\u201cSo,\u201d she said, briskly, \u201cWith all of these good things in mind, have you given any thought to a career to pursue once you have completed your education?\u201d\nHe was nervous, he realised. More nervous than he expected to be. He rubbed his damp palms on his trouser legs, and tried to make eye contact.\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to register myself. With the ministry.\u201d\nHe saw her purse her lips, but she didn\u2019t interrupt.\n\u201cAnd\u2026 I mean I don\u2019t know much about it, not as much as I ought to, maybe, but\u2026 the war\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the war, Lupin?\u201d She snapped.\n\u201cWell\u2026 people - wizards - they don\u2019t want someone like me, with my problems to have jobs at all, so I thought--\u201d\n\u201cWe cannot submit to others low expectations of us, Lupin. You have done great things, at Hogwarts, and I have no doubt you are capable of greater things still.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d he shrugged, \u201cBut I won\u2019t get the chance unless I\u2026 unless I get involved, I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cGet involved.\u201d Any trace of kindness or encouragement had left her face.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cMr Lupin.\u201d McGonagall\u2019s brow furrowed. She looked tired, as though she\u2019d been working on a difficult problem all day, \u201cYou know that I have already spoken with Mr Black, about his own plans.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus wasn\u2019t sure what that had to do with anything.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure you can imagine exactly what Mr Black\u2019s plans are.\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 I could guess\u2026\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t need to guess. they had all discussed it last night, all four of them on James\u2019s bed.\nJames had always been the head of the group - the leader. His innate goodness, his confidence and his easy going demeanour had ensured this from their very first meeting on the Hogwarts Express. But now, to Remus, at least, he seemed to have taken on a new dimension of wise heroism in his decision to join Dumbledore and pit himself against Voldemort.\nIf James was doing it, then they were all pretty sure it was the right thing to do. Sirius had spoken at length, and with some emotion, about his own desire to beat \u2018them\u2019. Remus had the impression that Sirius didn\u2019t see the war as political, so much as extremely personal. Voldemort might as well have been his mother, or his father. Peter was always excited to begin a new venture, and Remus had to admit that he was impressed - Wormtail was usually the first to point out the risks in a such a plan. But James made it all seem so easy; so simple.\nAs for Remus, there was never any question. He had no other options, as far as he could see it, and the least to lose out of all of them. The three boys he shared a room with had been his primary concern for the past five years, and he saw no reason for this to change when they left school. And he couldn\u2019t deny, even to himself, that staying close to Dumbledore seemed the most likely route to Greyback.\nHe said none of this to McGonagall, of course.\nThe professor removed her spectacles, rubbed her eyes, and covered her face with her hands. She sighed, and the sound struck Remus in a painful way, in the pit of his stomach \u2013 he had disappointed her.\n\u201cMr Lupin, I have interviews with Mr Potter and Mr Pettigrew later this afternoon. Am I to assume that I will hear the same things from them? Don\u2019t any of you have any career ambitions beyond this dreadful war?\u201d\nRemus shrugged, looked at his feet. She wouldn\u2019t change his mind.\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be time for that.\u201d He mumbled, \u201cAfterwards.\u201d\nShe lowered her hands, replaced her glasses and looked at him. Her eyes were rimmed red, slightly puffy. She wasn\u2019t giving him her famous \u2018look\u2019, trying to unnerve him into giving the right answer. The expression she wore was something different entirely - one that didn\u2019t suit her at all. He didn\u2019t like it.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t become a teacher for this.\u201d She said, very quietly, her voice strained.\nHe didn\u2019t know what to say to that. He felt sorry - but he didn\u2019t want to say so, in case she pounced on this as an avenue to dissuading him.\n\u201cI think Peter wants to do something at the ministry,\u201d he offered, \u201cafterwards.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a start, at least,\u201d McGonagall smiled tightly, and reshuffled her papers. \u201cNow, Mr Lupin, let\u2019s talk about NEWTs, shall we?\u201d\n* * *\nThursday 14th May 1976\nShakily, Remus made his was to the very top of the quidditch stands. He found his friends, Lily, Mary, Peter and Desdemona, waiting excitedly as the crowd began to cheer. He sat next to Desdemona, who was wearing Peter\u2019s red and gold scarf,\n\u201cHi Dezzie,\u201d Remus smiled and gave a little wave. \u201cEr\u2026 are you cold?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to blend in,\u201d she giggled, \u201cPetey thought they wouldn\u2019t let a Ravenclaw sit here.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShould you be here, Moony?\u201d Peter asked, watching the players walk out onto the pitch with a pair of binoculars, \u201cFeeling ok?\u201d\n\u201cOh no, have you been ill again, Remus?\u201d Desdemona clucked sympathetically.\n\u201cOh, er, Remus was just, er\u2026\u201d Peter stammered, realising his mistake,\n\u201cOut by the greenhouses.\u201d Remus said, blandly. \u201cI\u2019m stoned out of my mind.\u201d\nHe was stone cold sober, but Desdemona was an innocent sort of girl.\n\u201cEr\u2026 ok\u2026\u201d She smiled politely, but inched away from him, slightly.\nHe had slipped out while Madam Pomfrey was in her office. He felt bad about it, and would apologise later, but he had to see his friends play. They would do the same for him. It was Gryffindor vs. Hufflepuff today, and the crowd braying opposite was decked out in glorious sunshine yellow. It had rained in the night (Remus knew this because he had woken up with wet hair and feet) and the skies were a clear spring blue. Knowing that James would see this as a very good omen, Remus smiled to himself and cheered along with his friends.\nIt was a good game \u2013 a great one, for Sirius, who was in particularly good form. He never missed a bludger, and at one point made an impressive swing right in the nick of time to save the third Gryffindor chaser, leaning so far over that Remus was sure he would topple to the ground.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be another party if we win, is there?\u201d Lily said over the cheers as James scored his fifth goal, \u201cI don\u2019t think we can cope with another one this close to exams.\u201d\n\u201cNot if James has anything to do with it,\u201d Remus said, \u201cHe won\u2019t want to throw away the hours he\u2019s been putting in at the library.\u201d\n\u201cLibrary?!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s been there every day, almost,\u201d Peter filled in, \u201cRevising his bloody arse off. He\u2019s even more of a swot than Moony these days.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d Lily raised an eyebrow.\n\u201cBelieve it.\u201d Remus laughed, \u201cHe\u2019s even enforced dorm room rules so he can get enough sleep between exams. We have to be completely silent after eight o\u2019clock.\u201d\nAnother cheer went up \u2013 the sixth goal for James, twelfth overall for Gryffindor.\n\u201cHa!\u201d Peter roared, \u201cThey\u2019ll never catch up now!\u201d\nGryffindor won, of course \u2013 Remus wasn\u2019t sure if James had yet lost a game. As soon as the final whistle had been blown, all of the Gryffindor students poured down onto the pitch to congratulate their team. Mary was at the head of this, having run down a few minutes ahead of everyone else. Remus, as ever, was behind.\nHe didn\u2019t usually mind, but with the moon so close behind him, he was still pretty sore, and his limp more pronounced than usual. It was probably better if he waited for everyone else to get down, he thought, less people to notice him struggling. Madam Pomfrey had once or twice suggested a walking stick, for when his hip was very bad, but he wouldn\u2019t hear of it.\nRemus was almost all the way down the rickety wooden steps, and could see James and Sirius at the centre of a red robed mob on the quidditch pitch. James looked up and waved at him, and Sirius caught on, waving too. Remus grinned widely, hoping they could see it, and stuck a thumb up by way of congratulations.\nAs he did so, something very sharp and hot stung his ankle, just as he\u2019d raised it to descend another step. With a yelp of surprise and pain, Remus tumbled forward, losing his balance completely and clattering down the rest of the stairs, landing in a heap at the bottom.\nOw\n, he thought.\n\u201cFuck.\u201d He said, pushing up with sore splintered hands, and trying to get to his knees, at least. The problem with being so lanky, he thought, was that there was more of you to get knocked.\nDazed and confused, he was grateful that most of the crowd had their backs turned to him \u2013 he must have fallen at least eight steps down. Then he heard it \u2013 the muffled giggling. He turned, pain shooting up his left side as he did so, and saw three faces hiding underneath the wooden scaffolding. It was Mulciber, Barty Crouch, and Snape.\n\u201cOopsie daisy!\u201d Crouch cackled, showing rows of sharp white teeth, a little too small for his mouth. \u201cPoor ickle Lupin!\u201d He was fiddling with something small and metal.\n\u201cTossers.\u201d Remus muttered, righting himself, hauling his body up as quickly as possible. He fumbled in his trouser pocket for his wand, praying it hadn\u2019t been broken. No, it was fine. He withdrew it and pointed it between the gaps in the steps. His ankle was still throbbing, an itchy, biting pain. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t blame us for your clumsiness,\nLoony Lupin\n.\u201d Snape said coolly, stepping backwards into the shadows. \u201cAnd get that wand out of my face, before I report you for drawing on unarmed students.\u201d\n\u201cUnarmed my arse!\u201d Remus growled, still aiming his wand, \u201c\nExpelliamus\n!\u201d\nBut nothing happened. They really were unarmed.\n\u201cWhat did I tell you, gentlemen?\u201d Snape sneered at his cronies, \u201cLoony Lupin is dangerously mad. Emphasis on the danger\u2026\u201d\nCrouch was beside himself now, giggling manically as he tossed the little metal token between his hands, like some weird juggling act. Was it a sickle? No, Remus could smell it now, even as they were backing away. It must be a prefect\u2019s pin. A silver one.\n\u201cOi!\u201d He yelled, suddenly, but they just laughed and kept walking.\nBy the time James and Sirius \u2013 who had seen Remus stumble, but not much else \u2013 reached him, the three Slytherins were gone.\n\u201cBloody hell, you ok Moony?\u201d James asked, helping him straighten up, offering an arm.\n\u201cFine, yeah\u2026 must have tripped. Stupid long legs, eh?\u201d Remus tried to smile. Sirius was there, and he refused to mention any kind of Slytherin attack with Sirius around. He was too unstable; too reckless these days. The hot, angry itch in his ankle was driving him mad.\nHe hoped murtlap essence helped that too. Bloody Snape. What had he done that for? None of the three who\u2019d attacked him were prefects, so where did they get the badge? And more specifically,\nwhy the bloody badge?!\nThe girls had arrived at the scene now, and were making a fuss, telling Remus to sit down and take deep breaths, asking whether this or that hurt. It was no good saying that\nnothing\nhurt, after he\u2019d just fallen head first down a flight of stairs, and it was no good saying that\neverything\nhurt, but that he\u2019d had much worse. And all the while his mind kept going back to the sting in his ankle, and the word Severus had used \u2013\ndangerous\n. What did he know? Or what did he think he knew?\n\u201cRemus, you really are awfully pale,\u201d Lily was saying.\nMarlene placed a hand on his forehead, and he batted her away irritated,\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He said.\n\u201cAlright, give him some air, for Merlin\u2019s sake!\u201d Sirius, who had up until now said nothing at all, suddenly burst out, pushing them all out of the way.\nRemus looked up, squinting through a few locks of stray hair, to see Sirius with his determined face on. He put his hands on his hips, in a very good imitation of James delegating jobs for a prank, \u201cYou lot go to the changing rooms, or the great hall or wherever you\u2019re supposed to be. Moony, c\u2019mon, let\u2019s go back to the castle, we\u2019ll go by the hospital wing. Prongs, you\u2019ll take my broom back.\u201d\nRemus almost opened his mouth to protest - he couldn\u2019t possibly go to the hospital wing, which he\u2019d only escaped a few hours ago. Madam Pomfrey would never let him leave again once she saw the mess he\u2019d got himself into against her orders. But Sirius was offering him a way out, so he took it.\nHe accepted the offer of Sirius\u2019s arm, and got up, stiffly.\nOw\n, he thought again. He\u2019d badly bruised one of his knees, and his hip was worse than ever. He staggered slightly, but Sirius allowed him to lean into him. He was still in his crimson quidditch robes, trimmed with gold, though he\u2019d taken off the helmet, his hair coming loose from its ponytail. He smelled mildly of perspiration, fresh air and grass.\n\u201cI\u2019ll come too!\u201d Mary chirped, getting up. She was taking her position as queen consort of Gryffindor very seriously.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Sirius said, firmly but kindly, \u201cWe don\u2019t need a big fuss, do we, Moony? C\u2019mon.\u201d\nHe gave Mary a quick peck on the cheek before leading Remus down the last few steps, and off the quidditch pitch back towards the castle.\nRemus pulled away, as soon as he thought he could walk unassisted, and Sirius let him, but kept a steady pace, so that it would take them a long time to get back.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to go and see Pomfrey if you think you\u2019re ok.\u201d He said, quickly, \u201cI just thought you\u2019d like to get away from that lot.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026 cheers,\u201d Remus nodded, cautious.\n\u201cI know you hate people worrying over you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cMoony? How did you actually fall? You never fall over, even after a moon.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I dunno. Wasn\u2019t looking where I was going.\u201d\nSirius seemed to accept this for now, and they kept walking. It must have taken almost half an hour for them to make it all the way up to. Gryffindor Tower. Sometimes Remus wished he was a Hufflepuff if only for accessibility purposes. Finally there, Remus collapsed onto his bed, aching all over and completely exhausted. He hated being that way in front of Sirius. He didn\u2019t want to show any sign of weakness.\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to have a shower, if that\u2019s ok?\u201d Sirius said, quietly. Remus nodded, closing his eyes.\nOnce the bathroom door clicked shut, he fumbled in his bedside table for the murtlap essence. He\u2019d need more, after the next moon, though this jar had lasted longer than any other he\u2019d had, thanks to the marauders. He raised his trouser leg, and found the pin prick. Bastards. It was angry red and raised, slightly, like a mosquito bite. The skin around the puncture was turning deep bruise purple. The murtlap essence didn\u2019t help at all. Definitely silver, then.\nRemus lay down and tried to ignore the pain, allowing his muscles to relax and sleep to take over. He was still lying in this dozy, slightly feverish state when Sirius emerged from the bathroom, a waft of muggy steam and faint aftershave.\n\u201cAre you sleeping?\u201d He whispered, so gently.\n\u201cAlmost,\u201d Remus murmured, opening his eyes just a bit.\nSirius drew the curtains closed, dimming the light in the room. He stood just by Remus\u2019s bed. He picked up the jar of murtlap essence.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this for? Cut yourself?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMoony, please tell me what happened? It obviously wasn\u2019t an accident.\u201d Sirius frowned, \u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, I trust you,\u201d Remus frowned back, \u201cI just\u2026 look, I don\u2019t need you going out for revenge, ok? It\u2019s stupid, and it\u2019ll blow over.\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cThree Slytherins. They tripped me - yanked my foot through the stairs, that\u2019s all. Cowardly gits.\u201d Best not to mention the silver.\n\u201cWhich Slytherins?\u201d Sirius\u2019s voice was hard.\n\u201cNot Regulus.\u201d Remus replied, hurriedly, \u201cSnape, obviously. Mulciber and Crouch. Sirius,\u201d he said, as sternly as he could muster, \u201cI\u2019m fine, ok? Please don\u2019t make it worse.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Sirius said, though he sounded uncertain. They were quiet for a bit. Remus closed his eyes again, his eyelids heavy. \u201cShall I leave you to sleep?\u201d Sirius asked, his voice gentle again.\n\u201cYeah, cheers,\u201d Remus murmured, relaxing again.\n\u201cI\u2019m knackered too,\u201d Sirius said, lightly, with half a laugh, \u201cAfter that match. Sort of jealous of you for having the excuse. Almost wish I could just lie down here with you and not get up again until tomorrow.\u201d\nRemus opened his eyes again, to check Sirius\u2019s face, but he was looking away. \u201cBetter get down for the feast, though. Can\u2019t miss James\u2019s victory speech.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t go near the Slytherins,\u201d Remus said, \u201cPromise?\u201d\n\u201cPromise.\u201d Sirius nodded.\nHe left the room shortly after that, and Remus fell asleep feeling satisfied that no matter how much Sirius hated Slytherin, he would never do anything so reckless that Remus could not forgive him it."

He tried to pretend they were nothing more than the usual end of year exams, but this was almost impossible when everybody else seemed to have lost their heads over it. James became a veritable recluse, holed up in the library or behind his bed curtains obsessively memorising facts and dates he had spent the rest of the year ignoring. Peter occasionally turned very pale and stared, trembling, into space. Marlene had taken to ambushing Remus at various intervals throughout the day, demanding that he quiz her on this or that.\nOnly Sirius seemed calm about any of it, which was just typical. When even James had shut him out, he entertained himself by distracting Mary. Which had the added benefit of distracting Remus, which was horrible, but bearable.\n\u201cGo and find a broom cupboard like everyone else!\u201d Marlene yelled, on the edge of hysteria, throwing a slipper at the couple. They were wound together on the couch in front of the fireplace.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to go, though,\u201d Mary sighed to Remus, in the library the day before OWLs were due to begin. \u201cSirius won\u2019t let me up into your dorm, and boys can\u2019t get in ours\u2026 and I don\u2019t dare get caught in a cupboard somewhere, not with this castle crawling with wannabe death eaters.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Remus finally paid attention, \u201cHas someone tried to hurt you, Mary?\u201d\n\u201cOh, all the time,\u201d she shrugged, with a tired smile, \u201cI\u2019m used to it by now. At least being the only black kid at my primary school prepared me for something.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s horrible, Mary, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Remus squeezed her had, feeling genuinely terrible. Mary was a very tough girl, he knew - you could get away with saying almost anything around her. She might throw a bit of a strop, but she\u2019d forgive you quickly afterwards, and never hold it against you. Still; this was something else entirely, and it was obviously having an effect.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so sweet, Remus,\u201d she smiled kindly, squeezing his hand back. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, though. I\u2019ve got Sirius.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d Remus released her hand, returning to his work before casually asking, \u201cWhat does he say about it?\u201d\n\u201cOh, y\u2019know, that he\u2019ll defend me to the death, that nothing they do can ever come between us\u2026 to be honest, I think he has a bit of a white knight complex.\u201d\n\u201cWell.\u201d Remus closed his book and looked up at her, \u201cYou\u2019re no damsel in distress.\u201d\nMary\u2019s face split in a lovely grin. She really was very beautiful.\n\u201cCheers, Remus, knew I could count on you to support the women\u2019s lib argument. Right, can we go over the Defence Against the Dark Arts paper again? Professor Droskie hinted there\u2019d be something on either werewolves or vampires...\u201d\nRemus would never know whether it was the increased attacks on muggleborns - and therefore Mary - that caused the incident which took place after the DADA written exam. He flattered himself, once or twice, that it could have had something to do with Severus\u2019s dogged pursuit of Remus, even though Sirius had promised not to retaliate. He liked to think, later on, that James and Sirius had acted out of a kind of righteous indignation; that this was a chance to prove they had picked a side.\nIn reality, it was probably a mixture of reasons; none of them noble - the heightened tension of OWLs, combined with the relief of having just finished an exam. Growing tensions that had been simmering all year - in fact, for a number of years - between Gryffindor and Slytherin. Severus Snape simply being an annoying prick, James wanting to impress Lily, Sirius\u2019s merciless aggression towards anyone who so much as hinted allegiance to \u2018the other side\u2019.\nIn short, no one was quite themselves that day, and it was hot - these two factors alone might have been enough to bring a situation to boiling point. The fact that Sirius was playing the bored aristocrat, and that James was eager to please him was nothing new - and could potentially be explained away later as obnoxious teenage behaviour. Besides, those who knew Sirius, and what he had suffered, were inclined to pander to him; allow him to put on airs - and James was particularly indulgent.\nThe level of cruelty was certainly new, and could not be explained so easily.\nUnfortunately, as the years would go on, Remus would see more and more of this ruthlessness - not always from his friends, but certainly from people he had thought were \u2018good\u2019. It would always seem to Remus that this was the day the war truly started, as far as the marauders were concerned.\nRemus did not consider himself blameless, of course. He could have stepped in. He did put down his Transfiguration book when Lily got involved - but he had assumed she would shut everything down, scold James and move on. He certainly hadn\u2019t expected Snape to say what he had said, or for James to do what he did next.\nPart of him had enjoyed it, too. Part of him liked seeing Snape humiliated and tormented, without Mulciber around to back him up. It was horrible to see Lily so insulted, of course, and when James started really going for it, Remus had to bite his lip to keep from cheering and laughing along with everyone else. He ought to have stopped it. He ought to have stood up to his friends, taken control and been the better man. He just didn\u2019t feel like it.\nWhether or not his intervention would have improved or worsened the situation - or the events that followed - Remus might never know. But he did wish he had tried.\n* * *\n\u201cYou\u2019ve blown any chance you ever had of being with her now, mate.\u201d Sirius laughed, as Lily stormed out of the dining hall later that day, upon seeing James at the table.\n\u201cFine.\u201d James said, scowling. \u201cDo you know what, I\u2019ve wasted to much bloody time pining after her, and if that\u2019s how she feels--\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it how she\u2019s always felt?\u201d Peter asked, pouring out his gravy glumly. Another casualty of the altercation with Snape - Peter and Desdemona had apparently had a blazing row over it. She thought it was bullying; she couldn\u2019t see what Snape had done wrong.\n\u201cShut it, Pettigrew.\u201d Sirius rolled his eyes. He addressed James, \u201cForget about her, Prongs, she\u2019s always been up herself.\u201d\n\u201cOi,\u201d Mary slapped his thigh lightly, \u201cLily\u2019s my\nfriend\n, if you don\u2019t mind. Though, James, I do think you\u2019d better leave her alone for a bit. She\u2019s really upset.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Remus asked, feeling guilty. He ought to have stopped it.\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Mary replied, neatly slicing up her roast potatoes, \u201cDon\u2019t ask me why, but Snivellus has been her best friend since they were kids. I\u2019ve tried telling her what a massive tosser he is, but it doesn\u2019t really get through. She feels sorry for him, I think. He\u2019s madly in love with her, of course.\u201d\n\u201cEurgh, she doesn\u2019t like him back, does she?!\u201d James looked scandalised.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mary shrugged, \u201cBut they\u2019re friends all the same. Or at least they\nwere\n. She\u2019s not talking to him, now.\u201d\nRemus made a mental note to check whether she was ok - that was, if Lily was still speaking to\nhim\n. Her final outburst had definitely felt like an attack on all of the marauders, not just James.\n* * *\nFriday 12th June 1976\nThe Transfiguration written exam was the following week, and Remus was over prepared, if anything. He had a burning desire to beat James, if he couldn\u2019t beat Sirius at it. He thought he could probably best them in the written if he couldn\u2019t in the practical. The paper was three hours long, and demanded a huge amount of concentration.\nRemus only looked up twice, both times to check on Sirius. The first time, he was working on his essay, his quill moving smoothly, as if skating over the parchment, rather than scribbling away like James or Peter. The second time, he was leaning back on his chair, trying to catch James\u2019s eye. Remus sighed. It was so much harder to concentrate this close to the moon. He felt more animal than usual.\nHe was really looking forward to the upcoming moon, as much as he knew it was foolish. It would be the last one of the school year, and all four of them had been planning it quietly over the past week. Exams would be finished, and they were practically invincible, with what felt like the whole world at their feet. James swore he had caught a glimpse of a unicorn last time, and they\u2019d been reading up on how to track them down. Remus wasn\u2019t sure what the wolf might do, faced with a unicorn, but there was no evidence he would attack. Centaurs were something else altogether - centaurs terrified the wolf.\nWhen the exam finished, the students were instructed to stand back against the walls of the Great Hall while McGonagall magically collected in all of the papers alphabetically (in the most elegant use of\naccio\nRemus had ever seen) and reinstated the house tables ready for dinner. Across the hall, Snape was glaring at James furiously.\n\u201cDunno what more he wants,\u201d James tutted, \u201cWe\u2019ve got detention, haven\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u201cDid a teacher see you?\u201d Mary asked, as they wended their way over to their usual seats for dinner.\n\u201cNah, bloody Evans.\u201d Sirius groaned.\n\u201cMy\ndear friend Lily\n.\u201d Mary said, firmly.\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d Sirius grunted. \u201cShe just better not drag it out until tomorrow night.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Mary asked, smiling as dinner appeared on the empty plates before them. Spaghetti Bolognese. \u201cTaking me somewhere nice, for once?\u201d\n\u201cI think the sixth floor girl\u2019s loo\nis\nnice.\u201d Sirius replied sarcastically. \u201cAnyway, no. Got something else. Marauder business.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, of course,\u201d Mary sighed, as if she was terribly hard done by, \u201cI forgot I have to share my boyfriend with\nhis\nboyfriends.\u201d\nJames and Peter snickered, but Sirius bristled like a cat.\n\u201cFuck\u2019s sake,\u201d he spat, looking daggers at her from across the table, \u201cWhy do you have to say shit like that? Spiteful cow.\u201d\n\u201cPureblood snob.\u201d She returned, sweetly, twirling spaghetti on her fork.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Remus said, battling a headache, \u201cPeter and Desdemona are arguing this week. You\u2019ll get your turn next week.\u201d\nThat made everyone laugh, and went some way to calming the atmosphere. Remus was pleased with himself. He was really getting the hang of the whole relationship thing, without ever having to actually be in one.\nBy the time dinner was over, all was well again, and when James got up to go for detention, Sirius told him he would catch up later.\n\u201cI want to make sure Mary gets back to the tower ok,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m not going alone, Remus is coming too, aren\u2019t you Remus?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he nodded, hoisting his book bag up onto his shoulder, \u201cI\u2019m finally going to read something with a plot, now exams are over.\u201d\n\u201cSuch a thrilling life you lead, Moony,\u201d Sirius smirked. He clasped Mary\u2019s hand, \u201cStill, I\u2019d rather come with you. So I don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you be such a prick one minute and then so sweet the next?\u201d Mary sighed, kissing him.\nRemus looked away, politely. That was very much the question, with Sirius, he thought. That was exactly what you were getting yourself into with him.\n\u201cAll right, but don\u2019t be too long,\u201d James said, \u201cDetention is with Filch. Evans is a sadist, I swear.\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t take fifteen minutes.\u201d Sirius assured him, and they set off, the three of them, Remus walking just a bit behind the whole way.\n\u201cOh, for god\u2019s sake.\u201d Mary said loudly, as they reached the portrait hole, and Remus peered around to see what the holdup was. Ah. Of course. Snape again. Reflexively, Remus reached for his wand. \u00a0\u201cLook, she\u2019s not interested in talking to you, so bugger off!\u201d Mary snapped, still holding Sirius\u2019s hand.\n\u201cBlack,\u201d Severus drawled, \u201cTell your muggle bitch to shut up.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you call me?!\u201d Mary shrieked, as Sirius whipped out his own wand and raised it.\nThis is the time\n, Remus thought to himself,\nthis is the time to be a prefect. This is the time to be\nbrave. Sirius had just opened his mouth when Remus stepped forward, standing between the two dark haired boys.\n\u201cStop it right now!\u201d He said, in his most dangerous voice, \u201cSnape, go back to your own common room, or I\u2019ll give you detention. Black, just\u2026 calm down, ok?\u201d\nSirius was red in the face, and did not lower his wand. Snape cocked an eyebrow,\n\u201cListen to him, Black, even\nLoony Lupin\nknows you couldn\u2019t beat me in a duel.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said,\u201d Remus hissed, \u201cShut up and get lost.\u201d\n\u201cShould I get someone?\u201d Mary asked, nervously watching Sirius\u2019s face.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s ok\u2026 just go in.\u201d Remus said, watching her crawl through the portrait hole. He turned back to Sirius, \u201cCome on, you\u2019ve got detention now, let\u2019s go\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not looking well, Loony Lupin.\u201d Severus said, suddenly. Remus turned, confused. What fresh hell?! \u201cComing up on your time of the month, is it?\u201d\nThe implication was clear. Remus was speechless, shocked. He gaped, finding his voice,\n\u201cYou\u2026 you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d\nSnape smiled, obviously thrilled to have wrought such a reaction. He looked at Sirius, now,\n\u201c\nYou\nall know, of course. You and Potter and that little rodent, Pettigrew? You know what he is? I always wondered why three purebloods would want to waste their time on filthy scum like him, but now I see - he\u2019s your little pet project, isn\u2019t he, Black?\u201d\n\u201c\nConfringo\n!\u201d\n\u201c\nExpelliarmus\n!\u201d\nRemus and Sirius both shouted their incantations at the same time, but Remus was quicker, and had Sirius\u2019s wand in his hand before any further damage could be done. He rounded on Snape now.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you think you know,\u201d he said, very low, standing over the Slytherin boy, pointing two wands directly at his face, \u201cBut whatever it is, you\u2019re wrong. Now get back to the dungeons before I summon McGonagall.\u201d\nSnape, who had paled very slightly, gave a minuscule nod before edging around the two Gryffindors and slinking away, down the corridor. Remus didn\u2019t take the wands off him until he was definitely gone, and he didn\u2019t give Sirius\u2019s back until the last moment. Sirius snatched it and glared at him,\n\u201cWhat did you do that for?!\u201d\n\u201cSirius! Do you want another detention?!\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear the things he said about Mary?! The things he said about you?!\u201d\n\u201cOf course I did.\u201d Remus folded his arms, coldly. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a complete knob. A complete knob who you humiliated yesterday, and who you promised me you wouldn\u2019t go after.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but---\u201d\n\u201cYou promised, Sirius.\u201d Remus stared him down. He saw the look in Sirius\u2019s eyes - he had just realised that they were completely alone, and standing quite close. He stepped back, smartly,\n\u201cI know what I said,\u201d he replied, his voice still thick with rage, \u201cBut I won\u2019t have him spreading rumours about you! He deserves a taste of his own bloody medicine.\u201d\n\u201cSirius,\u201d Remus moaned, \u201cPlease, just\u2026 just go to your detention and calm down, ok? I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\nYears later, Remus would look back on that conversation with the benefit of hindsight, and scold himself for leaving things that way. But they were not yet the men they would become, and as much as Remus liked to think he was mature and intuitive - he was about to learn that he still didn\u2019t know the first thing about Sirius.\nBesides, he didn\u2019t have the patience. The moon was coming."

The next thought was -\nwhere are\n\nthey\n?\nNo one had ever come. It was warm, too warm for June, and his heart would not stop pounding with the remnants of the wolf\u2019s frustration. He clambered to his feet, and staggered to the bed, dripping blood.\nIt was supposed to have been their final hurrah, he thought, miserably. They were supposed to chase unicorns. What had happened?\nAt once he began to worry - something awful must have taken place, something really terrible, for none of the marauders to come at all.

Only he couldn\u2019t ask what, could he? \u201cOh, you poor thing, it\u2019s been a bit of a night all round, eh?\u201d She began to heal his most pressing wounds.\n\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018all round\u2019?\u201d He asked, trying not to sound too anxious.\n\u201cOh\u2026 nothing, dear, nothing to worry about at all.\u201d\nIn the hospital wing, he would have tried to stay awake, but Madam Pomfrey stood over him to make sure he finished his sleeping draught, and he was out like a light.\n\u201cRemus? \u2026 psst\u2026 you awake?\u201d\nRemus opened his eyes, bleary and irritated, to see the fuzzy image of James float into view. Just James\u2019s head.\n\u201cProngs?\u201d He croaked,\n\u201cShh,\u201d James murmured, barely moving his lips, \u201cPomfrey won\u2019t let anyone in to see you, had to sneak in under the cloak. You ok?\u201d\n\u201cNot really,\u201d He could feel the new scars already, without moving. \u201cWhat happened? You didn\u2019t come.\u201d\nHis friend had an unfamiliar expression. Unfamiliar in James\u2019s features, anyway. Was it shame?\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Moony.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?! What happened?\u201d Remus asked again, his voice hardening. \u201cI can\u2019t remember anything.\u201d\n\u201cIt was\u2026 Godric, I don\u2019t know how to tell you.\u201d\n\u201cTry.\u201d\nWhere was Sirius? Why wasn\u2019t he here?! Remus wanted to scream it.\n\u201cLook, please don\u2019t be too angry with him, ok? He\u2019s an idiot, a bloody stupid idiot, but I don\u2019t think he realised, I don\u2019t think he meant\u2026\u201d\nAh. It dawned on Remus all too quickly.\n\u201cJames. What did Sirius do?\u201d\nJames had never once been dishonest for as long as Remus had known him. And yet, as the story poured out of him, it was still tempered with little white lies - whether they were meant to protect Remus or Sirius, it wasn\u2019t clear. Sirius hadn\u2019t been thinking; he had been reckless; he hadn\u2019t meant any harm.\nBut he had caused a great deal of harm, whether he meant to or not - and might have been responsible for much more.\n\u201cHe\u2026 told Snape.\u201d Remus said, trying to get a grip on the situation, feeling a horrible, sick, prickly sensation beginning in his stomach and creeping upwards.\n\u201cNot\u2026 not exactly,\u201d James blinked, wetting his lips, \u201cHe told him how the willow worked, and Snape\u2026 you know what Snape\u2019s like.\u201d\n\u201cI know what Sirius is like.\u201d\nJames nodded, as if accepting that this was fair enough.\n\u201cNo one got hurt. Sirius bottled it at the last minute and told me, I managed to stop Sniv\u2014Snape-from getting too close, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHe saw me.\u201d Remus thought he might be sick. There was a terrible roaring inside his ears, as if he was falling into a dark pit, a desperate canyon. He closed his eyes. \u201cCan you go away, please, James?\u201d\n\u201cAnd we would have come, me and Pete, we would have, but Snape went to Dumbledore, and you were so riled up--\u201d\n\u201cJames! I want you to go.\u201d He hissed, closing his eyes.\n\u201cBut Moony\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u201c...Ok, mate. Ok. But I\u2019ll be back.\u201d\nRemus said nothing, did not even open his eyes again until he heard the curtain rustling and knew he was alone. Eventually, Madam Pomfrey poked her head around the corner.\n\u201cHello, dear,\u201d she said, softly, \u201cI\u2019ve got another sleeping potion here\u2026 now I know you don\u2019t want it, but--\u201d\n\u201cGive it here,\u201d he reached out an aching arm at once. Anything to make it all go away. Anything which meant he would not have to think any more.\nHe ought to have seen something like this coming even if James hadn\u2019t. Sirius had been in freefall since Christmas, it had just been a matter of who he would crush when he finally landed.\n* * *\nMonday 14th June 1976\nRemus Lupin would never, ever forgive Sirius Black.\nIt was a decision he made almost the very instant he woke up the second time after that terrible moon. The weight of it all came crashing down on him, and he felt a rage so pure it burnt like a fever. This is how betrayal feels.\nHe had not been angry like that in a very long time. At the end of his fourth year, Remus had quietly made a choice to lower his defences, to soften and relax \u2013 at least around his friends. Keeping everyone at a distance - keeping everyone slightly afraid of you - had proved too exhausting to keep up for very long.\nBut now. Now, Remus found it very easy indeed. He barely spoke to Madam Pomfrey, except to demand to be allowed an extra few nights in the hospital wing.\n\u201cReally, Remus, rest is important, but staying in bed all day isn\u2019t healthy. You need exercise.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel well.\u201d He would repeat, from under the covers. It was childish, but she let him be childish. She knew what had happened. She felt sorry for him. The nurse tutted, and signed him in for another night.\nDumbledore was the worst. The bringer of bad news, as always, he had arrived the evening after it happened, to offer his own useless perspective on the situation. Remus sat up in bed, arms crossed, unflinching and unmoving.\n\u201cMr Snape has calmed down considerably, you may be pleased to hear.\u201d Dumbledore said, \u201cHe certainly had a fright, but he has been persuaded to act in the best interests of his school and his fellow pupils.\u201d\nRemus snorted at this. Dumbledore did not react.\n\u201cSo, no harm done. Your friend, Mr Black--\u201d\n\u201cNot my friend.\u201d Remus said, without looking at Dumbledore. He stared forward.\n\u201cRemus\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIs he expelled?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Dumbledore said, quietly, \u201cWhat Sirius did was incredibly foolish, incredibly dangerous. But it was a mistake. I have no doubt that he is truly repentant. He has learnt a valuable lesson, here.\u201d\n\u201cOh, brilliant.\u201d Remus snorted again, tightening his arms as if they were all that kept him together, \u201cAs long as the Black heir has learnt a good moral lesson. As long as it\u2019s benefited his personal development,\u201d\n\u201cRemus\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAs long as we can all look back on this and think, ah what an excellent parable! Thank goodness we all know now exactly what happens when you send your enemy after a deadly fucking monster!\u201d\n\u201cRemus!\u201d\nHe stopped, his face hot, and finally looked at Dumbledore. Cool, forget-me-not blue eyes stared back at him. Remus was reminded of their first meeting. He\u2019d been rude then, too, and angry. \u201cYou have every right to feel what you are feeling.\u201d Dumbledore said, calm as ever. \u201cAnd rest assured, Sirius will be punished.\u201d\nRemus wanted to mumble something sarcastic about the effectiveness of detentions when it came to Sirius Black. He didn\u2019t. Dumbledore continued. \u201cI will caution you now, as I did once before, when a childish prank got out of hand. Passion is an important quality, but we must all learn to exercise control.\u201d\n\u201cBit late for that.\u201d\n\u201cYou have been horribly let down by somebody close to you, and I\u2019m very sorry. But you cannot let this incident--\u201d\n\u201cPeople close to me have been letting me down since I was five.\u201d Remus said, bitterly, \u201cI\u2019m used to it. Anyway,\u201d he hunched down in his bed, wishing Dumbledore would go away and leave him in peace, \u201cWe weren\u2019t that close.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pity.\u201d Dumbledore replied. He stood up. \u201cBecause we will all need each other more than ever, soon enough. Forgive and forget, Remus.\u201d\nRemus did not say goodbye, he just rolled back over and tried to sleep.\n* * *\nMadam Pomfrey would not let him stay for three nights in a row. He went straight to Professor McGonagall instead. He knocked twice on the door, then barged straight in.\n\u201cRemus! Are you quite well?\u201d\n\u201cSend me back.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d His head of house stood up from where she\u2019d been sitting behind her desk.\n\u201cSend me back.\u201d He repeated, clenched fists, \u201cTo St. Edmund\u2019s. Exams are finished, I don\u2019t need to be here.\u201d\n\u201cRemus, the term is not finished. Unless you are unwell, I cannot send you anywhere.\u201d\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m a prisoner?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not, you silly boy. Sit down.\u201d\nHe thought about refusing, or even storming straight back out again. But she was so stern, and something drilled into him at an early age forced him to obey the raised voices of older women. She sat too, the colour in her face going down. She swished her wand, and a kettle appeared, along with two cups and saucers, \u201cTea, Mr Lupin?\u201d\n\u201cNo thanks.\u201d\n\u201cCome along now,\u201d she tutted, pouring him a cup anyway, \u201cI find that most unpleasant conversations can be made easier with the right refreshments. Help yourself to a biscuit.\u201d She nodded to a plate which had not been there a moment before.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. I just want to go.\u201d He said, his voice as level as he could keep it.\n\u201cYes, that much has been made clear.\u201d She sipped her tea, \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to send you back to St Edmund\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cTell Madam Pomfrey to let me sleep in the hospital wing, then.\u201d\n\u201cI shall do no such thing. You have a perfectly good bed in Gryffindor Tower.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t go there.\u201d\n\u201cGryffindors do not run away from our problems, Mr Lupin.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but Slytherins run away from werewolves.\u201d He spat. He looked at her, fixing her with a glare he thought he had almost perfected, now, \u201cI would have been arrested. Sent to Azkaban, or, or\u2026 or put down! I wouldn\u2019t even know I\u2019d done anything - and it\u2019s all his fault!\u201d\nOh no, he had to stop there. He was in quite serious danger of bursting into tears, and that could not happen. Under no circumstances was Remus going to cry over this.\nMcGonagall was kind, and waited for him to compose himself. He took a few short breaths, letting his curls fall in front of his face before finally he was able to meet her eye again. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep in a room with the person who did that.\u201d\n\u201cThat is perfectly reasonable.\u201d She said, gently.\nHe blinked.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not completely heartless, Mr Lupin,\u201d she smiled, \u201cBelieve me, I know how you must feel - I can imagine, at least. And I can tell you, I have had serious words with Mr Black myself \u2013 he\u2019s off the quidditch team, detention for the rest of the year, one hundred points lost\u2026 But we cannot make any drastic changes to your sleeping arrangements, not without anyone asking why.\u201d\nIt clicked. For the past few days, Remus had placed his pain at the centre of the universe. He had forgotten that no one else in the school knew a thing.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Was all he could muster.\n\u201cI am sorry, Remus,\u201d McGonagall said. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrendous cruelty. But it must be borne.\u201d\n\u201cThat reminds me.\u201d He fished in his pocket for his prefect\u2019s badge. He\u2019d broken the transfiguration spell on it and wrapped it in tissue paper, but it still felt hot in his hand. He placed it on the desk. \u201cTake that back. Give it to\u2026 I dunno, give it to James. I can\u2019t do it any more.\u201d\n\u201cRemus,\u201d McGonagall sounded sad now, pleading, \u201cDon\u2019t let this set you back. Talk to your friends.\u201d\nHe shrugged,\n\u201cCan I go?\u201d\n* * *\nHe went to the library. Where else? It would be simple enough for the marauders to find him if they wanted to, but then, they had the map too. There was nowhere to hide, except maybe the Shrieking Shack, and Remus would be damned if he ever spent longer in there than absolutely necessary.\nFortunately, everyone else seemed to be outside enjoying the early summer sunshine, leaving the library pretty much empty. He read - or tried to, anyway. It wasn\u2019t easy to concentrate when his own brain kept interrupting\n.\n\n\nShould never \u2018ave snogged \u2018im.\n\nLook, piss off, I\u2019m not in the mood.\n\nOh charming! You\u2019re the one who keeps trying to chat.\n\nI\u00a0want to talk to Grant, not you. You\u2019re a shit substitute.\n\nWell, you\u2019ve gotta ask yourself what that says about you, doncha. Find someone real to chat to, if you\u2019re so keen.\n\n...What\u2019s it got to do with the kiss?\n\nOoooh, it\u2019s a \u2018kiss\u2019 now, is it? Snogging\u2019s good enough for Grant, but for the great and glorious Sirius Black it\u2019s \u2018kissing\u2019 lah-dee-dah!\n\nEither be helpful or leave me alone.\n\nI told you \u2013 or the real Grant told you \u2013 not to kiss him. You thought you got off easy when he decided to ignore it, but now you\u2019re paying.\n\nYou\u2019re saying I did this.\n\nS\u2019what it sounds like.\n\nThat\u2019s not very kind.\n\nWas I supposed to be?\n\nI miss Grant.\n\nTough luck.\n\n\nEventually, it began to get dark. He missed dinner \u2013 he didn\u2019t think he could bring himself to eat in front of the marauders anyway. He just waited. It was only two weeks to go until term ended. He could avoid them that long; he\u2019d done it before. Stay in the library, get up early, go to bed late. Piece of cake.\nHe was chased out of the library at nine o\u2019clock, and \u2013 starving hungry by now \u2013 took a detour to the kitchens. The house elves there were only too happy to serve, building a plate of sandwiches, crisps and sweets, enough to feed a whole classroom. Remus scoffed the lot, and could have asked for seconds. But it was time to bite the bullet.\nHe walked slowly, as if that might help, and was waylaid by Lily, on prefect patrol.\n\u201cHiya,\u201d she smiled, \u201cFeeling better?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, much.\u201d He nodded. \u201cHow are you?\u201d\nShe looked down, fiddled with her hair.\n\u201cOh, y\u2019know. Fine. Sev\u2019s stopped lurking outside the common room now, at least.\u201d\n\u201cSorry about all of that\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d she waved a hand, \u201cI really thought that\u2026 oh, it\u2019s stupid, but I thought that maybe one day, he\u2019d change his mind about all of that pureblood nonsense, and when he did, I\u2019d still be there. Like all I had to do was just keep being his friend, and everything would just work out for the best. Stupid.\u201d She shook her head.\n\u201cNot that stupid.\u201d He replied, because it seemed like a nice thing to say.\n\u201cYeah, well. Could have saved myself a lot of heartache,\u201d she shrugged, stoically. \u201cWhat are you doing wandering around, anyway? Go to bed, you\u2019ve not been well!\u201d\nHe smiled at her \u2013 he hadn\u2019t smiled for ages. He was about to turn and keep going, when something made him change his mind. He bent down and wrapped his arms around Lily, squeezing her. She hugged back, which only made him grip harder, until he had lifted her off her feet, and she squealed, laughing,\n\u201cGod, you\u2019re stronger than you look, Lupin!\u201d\n\u201cSorry.\u201d He blushed, setting her down.\n\u201cNo, it was nice,\u201d she smiled up at him, patting his shoulder, \u201cYou ok?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t feel ok, entering the common room. Fortunately, it was very quiet. Some students still had exams, others were wiped out after a long day in the hot sun. The marauders were not there, but they had been recently.\nRemus knew exactly what he was going to do. It had fallen into place in the library, as he mulled over the first confrontation like a play he had to rehearse.\nHe went up the stairs. It was silly, he knew, but ever since his birthday, he had lingered \u2013 just for a second \u2013 on that one step in the staircase, every time he went up to bed, or down for breakfast. This castle kept memories \u2013 the marauder\u2019s map had taught him that much. And that step had held Remus\u2019s sweetest memory of all. He stepped over it now, resolute.\nHe pushed the door open with some force, startling the three boys inside. They were sitting on their beds. Peter was in his pyjamas, looking glum \u2013 Remus could only assume that meant no change with Desdemona. James was half undressed, rattling around in his bedside cabinet for something. Sirius was reclining, clearly about to make a sarcastic comment. When Remus entered, he sat up straight.\nRemus walked straight to his own bed, and picked up his pyjamas. He did not speak, but went straight for the bathroom, which he locked, then cast a silencing spell over. He didn\u2019t want to hear them. He wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d react to it.\nHe washed. He brushed his teeth. He put on his night things. Remus was more than aware that he lost some of his authority when dressed in a pair of baggy blue and white pyjama bottoms and a greying vest, but he had quite a few new scars, and didn\u2019t want to undress in front of them. He took a deep breath. He walked out, crossing quickly to his bed.\n\u201cMoony, I\u2026\u201d Sirius started.\nRemus ignored him, and turned to James,\n\u201cThank you for stopping Severus, James.\u201d He said, emotionlessly. \u201cYou saved both our lives.\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026\u201d James started, but Remus had climbed into bed, and closed his curtains with a flick.\nWell\n. He thought to himself.\nThat\u2019s that, then."

            "content": "Tuesday 30th June 1976\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Sirius Black, with big, anxious eyes, standing behind Remus as he brushed his teeth.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d murmured Sirius Black, low over the breakfast table, before Mary had arrived.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Pleaded Sirius Black, as Remus walked away again.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d whispered Sirius Black, as Remus closed his bed curtains every night.\nSo let him suffer,\nsaid the cruellest part of Remus, the part that had been hurt the most. He turned his head, he walked away, he closed doors and he shut his eyes.\nSorry isn\u2019t good enough,\nhe said, with every action.\nI don\u2019t know what is.\nJames and Peter watched, cautiously, out of the corners of their eyes. They knew not to get involved - though James undoubtedly bore the brunt of Sirius\u2019s distress; the late-night meetings had returned with a vengeance.\nThe girls noticed that something was wrong, but they weren\u2019t sure what - Lily thought he was nervous about going back to St Edmund\u2019s, Marlene thought he was worrying about OWL results. Remus went along with both notions gratefully. After all, he was doing everything he could bear to act as normally as possible. He joined the marauders for meals, he sat in his usual place, he read his books, he played chess with Peter, gobstones with James. In the evenings, he climbed the stairs to bed.\nBut he did not speak to Sirius. For the remaining two weeks of June, Remus didn\u2019t say so much as a word in his direction. He didn\u2019t even look at him, if he could help it.\nHe had the feeling, after the first week, that perhaps James didn\u2019t completely approve of this. Potter was furious on Remus\u2019s behalf, of course - at least in the facts of the matter - but James could be very blind when it came to Sirius\u2019s less excusable flaws. James would have forgiven him after the first apology.\nMaybe Remus was a weaker man. But he wouldn't be weak any more. He needed to get back to who he\nreally\nwas.\nWe can all learn our lesson.\nRemus had tried being soft and open, like all of his rich, well-bred friends - where had it got him? He\u2019d gone and fallen in love with his best friend, and almost got himself killed. He was ashamed of himself \u2013 mooning over Sirius like that.\nMoony\u2019s mooning.\nSirius would find that hilarious.\nSo he started avoiding James and Peter, too.\nHe stopped going to lessons \u2013 that was the first thing. There weren\u2019t many to go to, of course, with the last exams taking place, and the whole school falling into summer holiday mode. Still, he had introductory NEWT classes pencilled into his timetable in almost every subject except Potions - he couldn\u2019t wait to be rid of Potions.\nThe greenhouses were a good place to hide out. Remus found by the end of the year that he had spent nearly all of his carefully saved cash on cigarettes and weed. He told himself that was ok. Told himself he wouldn\u2019t need money to find and destroy Greyback, just the right scent and a full moon. Not that he thought about Greyback much. He tried not to think about anything for too long; anger gave way to a numbness which seemed easier to live with.\nWhen he couldn\u2019t be outside, he went to the library and pretended to read. Students from his study group stopped by occasionally, but he always found a reason to leave as soon as possible.\n\u201cHiya, Remus!\u201d Christopher popped out from between the stacks one afternoon, \u201cGlad I caught you! Can you recommend some summer reading? I\u2019ll be doing my OWLs next year!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Remus frowned, groggily. He\u2019d been just nodding off, and was annoyed at having been woken. He was sleeping a lot, lately, but never seemed to feel refreshed. \u201cOh, god, I dunno. They send you a book list.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I thought you might have some good tips!\u201d Christopher continued, relentlessly cheerful. \u201cEspecially in History, what did you do your final essay on?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 The Goblin Revolt.\u201d He shifted, trying to settle back onto his elbows.\n\u201cCool! Hey, maybe I could write to you, over the summer? We can swap notes, and--\u201d\n\u201cLook, Christopher, don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but could you please fuck off?\u201d\nHe would feel guilty about it later, but at least the annoyance went away.\nThe marauders never tried to find him, as far as he knew \u2013 he had taken the map the first chance he had, and kept it in his pocket at all times. This had the added benefit of helping him keep out of Snape\u2019s. The only thing Remus wanted to avoid more than his rage at Sirius was his utter terror at the thought of running into Severus.\nSnape had hated Remus before all of this \u2013 he was too close to Lily, he was friends with James, he had been responsible for coming up with at least half of the pranks on Slytherin. Since the incident, this obsession seemed to have deepened. He was still whispering at meal times, staring at Remus all the while, with a fresh kind of hatred that Remus could see would run and run. If Sirius had learnt a lesson from that awful night, then Remus certain that Snape had not.\nSirius was all too keen. He apologised, over and over \u2013 he never tried to explain himself, which was good, because if he had; if he had given an excuse, Remus didn\u2019t think he could control himself. it already took every ounce of nerve not to leap across the table, or the bedroom, or the common room and shake and punch and scream at Sirius -\nyou bastard, you bastard, you bastard.\nThe apologies he could cope with. Background noise. He didn\u2019t rise to the bait. Not that he didn\u2019t have things to say \u2013 not that he didn\u2019t re-play the monologue over and over, editing and perfecting until it was a great stream of miserable defeat, circling his head, fuelling his mood.\n\nSorry isn\u2019t good enough. Your guilt isn\u2019t good enough. I need you to feel it too. I trusted you. I trusted you with every last secret, I offered you every piece of me. What else have I got, now? I could kill you. I could bash your teeth in\u00a0so you choke on them, I could wrap my hands around your throat and squeeze, I could rip you to pieces, I could, I could, I could kiss you, you fucking bastard.\n\nIn his dreams, Remus said these things, and more. And always, in his dreams, Sirius stared back at him with calm contrition, as he removed his clothes and pulled Remus towards him. It appeared that betrayal was not enough to kill desire, though it made hiding it easier. By the time that wretched summer term ended, the only person Remus despised more than Sirius was himself, for continuing to love him just the same.\n* * *\n\u201cHello,\u201d Lily said, gently, poking her head around the carriage door. \u201cWondered where you\u2019d got to.\u201d\nRemus grunted, a small noise which was neither friendly nor rude. Lily came inside. \u201cWhat are you doing here, all alone?\u201d\nRemus shrugged, sucking his cigarette like it was keeping him alive. He hunched down in his seat as she took the place opposite.\n\u201cToo crowded in there.\u201d He said, by way of explanation.\n\u201cKnow how you feel.\u201d She replied. \u201c\u2026McGonagall told me you\u2019ve given up being a prefect.\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d He finished his cigarette. He lit another.\n\u201cShame. You were good at it.\u201d\n\u201cLiar,\u201d he smirked. Her face lit up too,\n\u201cYeah, ok, you were rubbish. But I\u2019ll miss you on my rounds.\u201d\nShe let this hang in the air for a moment, before frowning again. \u201cRemus? Whatever\u2019s going on with you and the other boys, I hope it gets better. You seem so miserable.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cBlack\u2019s off the quidditch team.\u201d\n\u201cIs he?\u201d\n\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d\n\u201cLeave it, Evans, just go away.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, you can\ntalk\nto me, I know how it feels to be let down by a friend\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHow\nis\nSnivellus?\u201d Remus snarled. He wished he could tell her that it wasn\u2019t her fault, that he couldn\u2019t help acting like a prick \u2013 that if he didn\u2019t act this way, then he wasn\u2019t really sure how to act at all.\n\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 well I\u2019m still not talking to him, as you know. He keeps trying, though. He\u2026 um\u2026 he had some pretty mad stories, actually\u2026 about you\u2026\u201d\nRemus looked at her, finally. She looked nervous, her hands twisting in her lap. She looked a bit scared of him, actually. \u201cI don\u2019t believe them!\u201d She said, suddenly.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d He raised an eyebrow. He should have known this was coming.\n\u201cI mean, just because you\u2019re\u2026 well, you do have a lot of scars \u2013 sorry \u2013 and you\ndo\nget ill quite a lot, but that doesn\u2019t mean... I hadn\u2019t really thought about it, maybe it\u2019s just a weird coincidence, Sev has always been a bit paranoid\u2026 and\u2026\u201d\nHe could have watched her squirm like that for ages, tangling herself up in apologies and unasked questions. But why bother. He could be reckless too.\n\u201cLily.\u201d He said, gently, stubbing out his last cigarette. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell anybody.\u201d\nShe stopped blathering, and stared at him. He saw her big green eyes widen even more, the look of surprise on her face so comical he could cry. Her breath hitched, then she nodded, resolute and quite serious.\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d She said. \u201cPromise.\u201d"

Remus was angry almost all of the time. It was too hot and he missed Hogwarts and he missed his friends and most of all he missed Sirius, but he also hated him. It was a huge mess. He missed Grant too; Grant, who might have made it all a bit more manageable, or at least offered some escapism.\n\n\nBut, as an unsatisfying conversation with another St Eddy\u2019s boy called Mike had told him, Grant had left St Edmund\u2019s shortly after Christmas. He was living in a flat in Mile End, apparently, though Remus didn\u2019t have much more information than that. ...and he\n\n\nhad\n\n\nsaid Remus could come any time.\n\n\n\nAt least I\u2019m not knocking over off licences or getting pissed on the common this time,\n\n\nhe thought, as he planned his escape. As summer rebellions went, this one was perhaps the most healthy.\n\n\nHe waited until the second full moon of the summer had passed \u2013 on the tenth of August. On the eleventh, he waited for Madam Pomfrey to come and give him the all clear, and then he just left. He was sore, and extremely tired, but at the time he didn\u2019t feel he had any other option. He packed a small bag, without taking books or homework or his wand or anything at all that reminded him of Hogwarts. He would be a muggle for a few days; why not.\n\n\nAll Remus had to do was walk out into the garden and crawl through the fence at the back, just as he had been doing for years to get into town. From there, he simply walked to the nearest tube.\n\n\nTheydon Bois underground station was about five miles away, but he did it easily in under two hours, even with a gammy hip. He couldn\u2019t afford a ticket, but it wasn\u2019t difficult to push through the barriers behind a group of suited business men on their way to work.\n\n\nHe got a seat on the train, and pretended to be asleep so that the ticket inspector wouldn\u2019t bother him, listening to the rattling rumbling roar of the train as the carriage whooshed along the tracks, like a great earthworm ploughing its way into central London.\n\n\nExcitement pulsed in Remus\u2019s chest as he reached Mile End, where he hurried out of the carriage into the dimly lit green and white tiled station.\n\n\nMile End had been hit by a German bomb during the war and still hadn\u2019t recovered from the shock of it. It was a dirty, sprawling mess of a high street, littered with rubble and newspapers, children playing in the road, noise everywhere. The grim anonymity suited Remus. Who would come looking for him here? Who would find him?\n\n\nHe wandered for a bit, unsure what to do next. The information he\u2019d been given was just a building name, no street address. But after asking in a newsagent, and quite literally following his nose, he found it.\n\n\nIt turned out that Grant didn\u2019t actually\n\n\nhave\n\n\na flat \u2013 not in the sense that he owned it, or was even renting it. As far as Remus could tell, it was a squat, shared with several other young men and women. He hadn\u2019t actually been expecting Remus, either.\n\n\n\u201cBloody hell!\u201d He exclaimed, when one of the girls finally brought him to the door, \u201cWhat are\n\n\nyou\n\n\ndoin\u2019 \u2018ere?!\u201d\n\n\nRemus felt very foolish. He wasn\u2019t sure what sort of welcome he would have liked, but it wasn\u2019t that.\n\n\n\u201cYou did say I could visit\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, sorry,\u201d Grant grabbed his shoulder and pulled him inside, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just a bit \u2018ungover, gimme a minute.\u201d\n\n\nHe led Remus into what appeared to be a kitchen. It smelled vaguely of curry and damp. There were bubbles in the wallpaper and holes in the yellow linoleum floor. Grant flicked on an electric kettle, \u201cOne of the girls sorted us out wiv a generator,\u201d he explained, \u201cShe\u2019s a mechanic or summink. Tea?\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded. Tea usually helped.\n\n\nGrant looked different. Only a year older than the last time Remus had seen him, he was thinner about the face. He\u2019d lost some of the brightness in his eyes, and his blond hair was even longer; still curly, but badly in need of washing. He seemed to have chipped a tooth at some point as well, and a bruise the colour of old honey marred his left cheek. Even so, he still had the same friendly grin. He handed Remus a steaming mug and smiled at him.\n\n\n\u201cYou look\u2026 well, like shit\u201d he said, sipping from his own mug. \u201cBeen sleepin\u2019 rough?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Remus shook his head, \u201cI just got off the tube from St Edmund\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah, \u2018ow\u2019s Matron? Kick you out, did she? Kicked me out, the old trollop.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNothing like that,\u201d Remus said, \u201cI just\u2026 thought I\u2019d visit. See how you were.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMike tell you where I was?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026 so who is Mike?\u201d Remus smiled at him shyly from behind his mug of tea.\n\n\n\u201cOh, y\u2019know,\u201d Grant smirked, \u201cJust some company for me. Couldn't pine over you all year, could I, posh boy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really thick.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs he?\u201d Grant looked mildly amused, \u201cI never noticed. Didn\u2019t really talk much.\u201d\n\n\nRemus snorted at this, and it felt\n\n\ngood\n\n\n. Grant made him feel so normal; he could never comfortably joke about that sort of thing with the marauders, even when they were all on speaking terms.\n\n\nThe squat was cleaner than it first appeared, but still in a pretty bad state. There were six of them living there, between two bedrooms and a living room - which was visible through a beaded doorway across the hall. Apparently one of the boys even slept in the bathroom because none of the plumbing was connected anyway; the only working tap was in the kitchen.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a loo in the courtyard,\u201d Grant explained, \u201cSometimes we can get in to use the showers at the boxing club next door.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOi oi,\u201d another young man had woken up from his spot on the sofa, \u201cMake us a cuppa, Grant darlin\u2019. Who\u2019s this?\u201d He was shirtless, dark skinned and gorgeous. He had the same faraway look Grant had now.\n\n\n\u201cMate of mine from the children\u2019s \u2018ome,\u201d Grant said, \u201cRemus Lupin.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s never your name.\u201d The stranger gawped at him.\n\n\n\u201cStraight up,\u201d Grant replied on Remus\u2019s behalf, \u201cGoes to a posh school and everything, innit. Remus, this is Adz.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBlimey,\u201d Adz stared at Remus, then back at Grant, \u201cHe one of us?\u201d\n\n\nGrant handed Adz a third mug of tea, and surveyed Remus, looking him up and down appraisingly. He nodded, very slightly. Remus wasn\u2019t sure what that meant, but he had some idea. He stifled a yawn. Grant clucked sympathetically,\n\n\n\u201cYou look dead on your feet.\u201d He said. \u201cHad one of your nights, \u2018ave ya? Go and lie down if you want, I\u2019ll kick \u2018em all out of the bedroom, no one\u2019ll bother ya.\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded gratefully and was led into a dark and dingy room.\n\n\n\u201cOi, you lazy gits, up you get. Got a mate \u2018ere who needs a kip.\u201d\n\n\nRemus murmured an embarrassed apology to the four young men who clambered to their feet and milled out of the room. The beds seemed to be used on a rotating basis, and no one looked annoyed by this intrusion. One of the boys even winked at Remus.\n\n\nThree sad single mattresses lay on the floor, strewn with old blankets and pillows. It smelt vaguely of mould, and strongly of unwashed bodies. Cardboard had been used to stop up the broken windows. Remus was glad it was the summer; it might have been freezing cold, otherwise. Despite it all, he slept easily, feeling that he had finally taken some control over his situation.\n\n\nGrant woke him some hours later. He looked a little bit better \u2013 as if he\u2019d had a good meal, at least. Remus\u2019s stomach rumbled.\n\n\n\u201cWakey wakey,\u201d Grant chirped, holding another mug of tea. Remus sat up, rubbing his eyes. Some of the soreness leftover from the full moon was still there, but he felt better. It must have been midday, judging by the blazing rays of light coming through the gaps in the cardboard.\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he rasped, sipping the tea, moving along so that Grant could sit beside him.\n\n\nThey sat in companionable silence for a little while, backs against the wall and legs splayed out in front of them.\n\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Grant said, finally, once he had judged Remus sufficiently awake, and half the tea was drunk. \u201cWanna tell me why you\u2019re \u2018ere?\u201d\n\n\nRemus shrugged,\n\n\n\u201cJust visiting. Sick of that place.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, well I know that feeling.\u201d Grant sighed, \u201cAin\u2019t you goin\u2019 back to school in a few weeks, though?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah. Maybe.\u201d He knew he had to. There was nowhere else to go.\n\n\n\u201cSick of that place too, eh?\u201d Grant nudged him, gently teasing. \u201cGo on, tell us what happened. Get yer heart broken?\u201d\n\n\nRemus looked at him, startled. Grant chuckled, \u201cYeah, thought so. Who is \u2018e, then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026\u201d Remus stuttered, \u201cIt\u2019s not that, it\u2019s complicated. My friend just\u2026 let me down.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, they always do,\u201d Grant nodded sagely. \u201cBet they\u2019re the worst for it, public schoolboys, eh? \u2018Specially with us peasants.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that at all!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d He waved a dismissive hand, \u201cTell yourself you\u2019re different if you like. Stay away from toffs, if you want my advice, we\u2019re just a bit of fun to them. Keep to your own kind.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about\n\n\nclass\n\n\n.\u201d Remus said, angrily. Grant glanced down at him, sympathetically, as if he was much older and wiser.\n\n\n\u201c\u2019ave a look around Remus,\u201d he said, gesturing to the dank room they were in, \u201cWe\u2019re British. It\u2019s always about class.\u201d\n\n\nRemus looked down at his chipped mug of greyish tea. Grant was probably right. What else was this stupid war all about? He felt he ought to say something else - something witty or clever. He stared at the tea and just felt sad. He might lose it, if he spoke. Grant set his own mug down on the wooden floor, and touched Remus\u2019s hand.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be ok. It stops hurting after a while.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d\n\n\nNo, it was no good, Remus had lost it. He sniffed a few times, trying harder than ever not to cry, but the tears came, and he was too tired. Grant put an arm around him, and Remus leaned on his shoulder, sobbing softly, hiccuping every now and then, like a little child. Grant kissed his head, softly, and whispered into his hair, \u201cAin\u2019t no shame in it,\u201d which only made him cry harder.\n\n\nIt was a good thing, maybe. Once he\u2019d finally calmed down he felt like he\u2019d had a good long sleep. He wiped his nose on his sleeve, and straightened up, looking for something else to talk about.\n\n\n\u201cIs everyone here\u2026 um\u2026 you know\u2026?\u201d He asked, shyly.\n\n\n\u201cQueer? Yeah, most of us. Nowhere else to go. Coppers leave us alone if we leave them alone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPolice? But it isn\u2019t a crime!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs for someone your age.\u201d Grant raised an eyebrow. \u201cAge of consent is twenty-one for us deviants.\u201d\n\n\n\"Oh right, yeah. But I haven't... I mean I wasn't going to...\"\n\n\nGrant laughed and ruffled Remus's hair,\n\n\n\"You staying the night? Lot of us are off to this pub up in Soho. It's safe enough.\"\n\n\n\"\n\n\nCan\n\n\nI stay, then? Just for a bit?\"\n\n\n\"Don't see why not. Come on, you, let's get you fed.\" He hauled himself to his feet, looking thinner than ever in his spindly drainpipe jeans. He offered Remus a hand and pulled him up too.\n\n\nLunch was baked beans on toast \u2013 the bread was a bit mouldy, but they scraped off the greenest bits. Afterwards, they sat about in the living room with some of Grant's housemates and smoked pot with Bob Dylan playing in the background. Everything felt distinctly muggle-ish, and Remus was glad of it. It was so simple \u2013 no one knew him except Grant, who hardly knew him well. It could be very easy to disappear, if you wanted to, Remus thought to himself.\n\n\nAfter a few deep drags on the spliff, Remus found himself lying on the slightly damp beige carpet, staring up at the tobacco stained ceiling. Grant gently placed a cushion under his head. He was being so kind, like an older brother \u2013 even though they were practically the same age and only a year ago had been all over each other. If Remus was being fully honest with himself, he had come prepared for more of the same, but was eternally grateful that Grant never so much as hinted in that direction.\n\n\n\"Fucking dog keeps barking,\" someone said in the background, bringing Remus slowly out of his dreamy state.\n\n\n\"What is it, a stray?\" Someone else asked.\n\n\n\"Dunno. Bloody massive, though. Horrible black thing.\"\n\n\n\"Did you say there's a black dog outside?\" Remus sat up, slowly, a sinking feeling in his belly. It couldn't be, surely.\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" Adz replied, standing at the window.\n\n\nRemus stood up and went over to join him. Sure enough, there it was. He stepped back quickly behind the curtain, so Sirius wouldn't see him. How far could dogs see?\n\n\n\"I um... I need the loo, just a minute.\" Remus muttered, exiting the flat quickly. He hurried down the stairs and took the door out to the courtyard, where he stood at the threshold, watching the huge black dog still barking up at the window.\n\n\n\"Hello, Sirius.\" He said, quietly. The dog turned and was quiet at once. \"James with you?\"\n\n\n\"Hiya, Moony,\" James stepped out from behind some bins, \"Lovely place you've got here.\"\n\n\n\"Look, I'm not in the mood.\" Remus folded his arms. He felt a bit light headed from the dope. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\nSirius had not transformed back, but sat there, watching him. Good. That made it easier for Remus to ignore him. He addressed James instead.\n\n\n\"What'd you mean 'what do we want'?\" James raised an eyebrow, \"We were worried about you! Your Matron called the muggle police and said you'd escaped, somehow Dumbledore found out and got in touch with my parents \u2013 I think they thought you'd come to ours. Sirius was sure you'd gone into London, he followed your scent practically all the way from the children's home.\"\n\n\n\"You were at St Edmund's?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\nRemus cringed at that, embarrassed. He had never wanted his friends to know what it was like where he lived. He sighed and held out his arms, as if presenting himself for inspection.\n\n\n\"Well, you've found me.\" He said. \"As you can see, I'm perfectly fine. Now go away. And tell your dog to stop barking.\" He couldn't help slipping in a nasty barb at Sirius. His desire to hurt him had not gone away, apparently. Padfoot whined slightly and ducked his head. James ignored it, focussing on Remus,\n\n\n\"You're\n\n\nnot\n\n\nperfectly fine. Never mind the fact that you appear to be hanging out in a muggle squat,\n\n\nor\n\n\nthe fact that the muggle police are looking for you. We have to bring you back, right now. Dumbledore can only avoid telling the ministry you've gone walkabout for twenty four hours, he said. Then they'll set the Aurors on you.\"\n\n\n\"What?! Why??\" But it suddenly dawned on Remus exactly why. He was not just a runaway teen, like Grant and his friends. He was a dangerous creature on the loose. He suddenly felt very, very tired. \"Fuck's sake.\" He muttered, looking down.\n\n\n\"Come home with us, Remus.\" James extended a hand, \"Dad said you can stay for the rest of the summer.\"\n\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t forgiven him.\u201d Remus said, fiercely, looking at James because he could not look at Sirius. James looked as tired as Remus felt.\n\n\n\u201cI know, mate. It\u2019s ok, he gets it.\u201d\n\n\nThat made him angrier still, he didn\u2019t want Sirius to \u2018get\u2019 it. He wanted\u2026 well, he didn\u2019t know what he wanted \u2013 begging on his hands and knees? Padfoot was doing a good job of that as it was.\n\n\nHe sighed.\n\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019ve got a friend here, let me go and tell him I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\n\n\nUpstairs, he called for Grant from the hall. He didn\u2019t like to say a big goodbye in front of everyone.\n\n\n\u201cYou alright, Remus mate?\u201d Grant said from the top of the stairs, peering down at James and the dog Sirius waiting in the hall.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, fine. Look, I\u2019m going to go\u2026 I have to go.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe a friend?\u201d Grant eyed James suspiciously. \u201cYou going to be safe?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s a friend from school. It's fine. I can ring you, maybe?\u201d He had no idea how he would contact a muggle squat from a wizarding household.\n\n\n\u201cYou can come back any time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks. Seriously, Grant, thanks for everything. You\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re amazing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me blush,\u201d Grant wrapped his arms around his skinny body, looking down at his feet. \u201cS\u2019nuffin\u2019 you wouldn\u2019t do for me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Remus nodded. Grant looked down the stairs again,\n\n\n\u201cThat dog belong to him or something? Should be on a lead.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, probably,\u201d Remus nodded, hoping Sirius could hear.\n\n\n\u201cNot dangerous, is it? Bloody hate dogs, me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s pretty tame, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be in touch, ok?\u201d Remus bit his lip, glancing back through the open door into the crowded squat, \u201cWill you be ok\u2026 here?\u201d\n\n\nGrant shrugged and grinned,\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, sweetheart. I always land on me feet.\u201d\n\n\nRemus stepped forward, putting a hand on Grant\u2019s shoulder to push him gently backwards into the shadow of the stairwell, so that they could not be seen by James and Sirius, or through the doorway. He hugged him, tightly. Grant hugged him back, so beautifully. They pulled away, and shared a brief, friendly kiss, before both grinning shyly and stepping apart.\n\n\n\u201cWhat is it about you, eh?\u201d Grant ruffled Remus\u2019s hair, \u201cDon\u2019t stay away too long.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSee you.\u201d Remus nodded."

It was Remus\u2019s first experience of this bizarre wizard transport, but he was so fuzzy from lack of sleep and the remnants of the weed that he found himself dozing off in the comfortable purple armchair. Sirius stayed a dog for the duration, but Remus refused to give him any extra points for this.\nJames shook him awake once they arrived - it was late afternoon now. Remus stopped outside the front gate, and looked at James nervously,\n\u201cWill Dumbledore be there?\u201d\n\u201cI think he\u2019s gone,\u201d James said, reassuringly, \u201cEr\u2026 Moody might have stopped by, though\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFor me?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 he\u2019s seeing dad\u2026 look, I didn\u2019t want to say anything on the bus, but it\u2019s been a bad summer, you know, for the war. We\u2019re losing.\u201d\n\u201cLosing?!\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026 let\u2019s talk about it inside - Padfoot.\u201d James clicked his fingers at the black dog. Instantly, Sirius transformed back into himself. Remus looked away at once. Still gorgeous, then.\nYou bastard, you bastard.\nInside, Mrs Potter came running,\n\u201cRemus!\u201d She reached her arms up to pull him into a hug,\n\u201cEuphemia!\u201d A voice barked from the living room.\n\u201cOh\u2026 for goodness sake.\u201d Mrs Potter muttered. She took a step back and looked Remus in the eye, \u201cWhat did Monty and I give you for Christmas in 1973?\u201d\n\u201cA chess set,\u201d Remus said, quickly, eyeing the doorway Moody\u2019s voice had come through.\n\u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201d Effie called, outstretching her arms once more and hugging him as tightly as their height difference would allow. \u201cWe were all so worried about you, dear!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m ok.\u201d Remus said, embarrassed.\n\u201cWe thought you\u2019d been\u2026 oh, well it doesn't bear thinking about. People going missing\u2026 dark marks\u2026 I really don\u2019t\u2026\u201d she looked very pale and washed out, as if she\u2019d had a lot of bad news lately. Remus felt terrible for adding to her troubles. \u201cNever mind,\u201d she said, briskly, smiling again, \u201cSomething to eat? Or would you like a wash, first? Albus sent your things, they\u2019re up in your usual room.\u201d\n\u201cMy\u2026 my things?!\u201d\n\u201cFrom the Home, dear. Dumbledore sent them first thing this morning\u2026\u201d\nEverything had happened so quickly. Was that really necessary? Moody appeared from the living room. He looked Remus up and down with one eye \u2013 the other, he appeared to have injured recently; it was covered by a thick leather patch. The effect made him look even more grizzled and terrifying than ever.\n\u201cLupin.\u201d He nodded, \u201cA word.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Alastor,\u201d Mrs Potter seemed to have surprised everyone, when she turned and placed herself between Remus and Moody, \u201cHe\u2019s only just arrived, and look at him \u2013 he\u2019s clearly exhausted. This can wait until tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cEffie, this is a matter of ministry--\u201d\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t give a toss,\u201d she tutted, shutting him up with a wag of her finger, \u201cHe\u2019s only sixteen, he\u2019s not of age, and he\u2019s in my care. Remus,\u201d she turned around, her voice kind again, \u201cYou just pop upstairs, eh? I\u2019ll have Gully send some food up, but don\u2019t you come down until you\u2019re quite ready.\u201d\nRemus blinked in amazement. Could it be that an adult actually wanted to leave him alone? That had to be a first. He had a new respect for Euphemia Potter.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he murmured, avoiding Moody\u2019s fierce gaze and edging past them, ignoring James and Sirius, heading straight for the stairs, climbing them as fast as his clunky hip would allow.\nAll of his things had been neatly tidied away into drawers and cupboards in his bedroom; as if he lived there. He wondered what it would be like, having a place like this to call home - a place with a private bedroom, and a house elf, and a mother. He took his wand out of his trunk and held it for a little while, just to feel it.\nWhat a day. Remus felt terrible about leaving Grant, after he had been so hospitable with the little he\u2019d had. There were three empty bedrooms in the Potter\u2019s house. Grant would be sharing a mattress on the floor tonight.\nHe sat on the bed and wished it wasn\u2019t so comfortable. He could easily sleep again, but he was hungry too, and didn\u2019t want to miss Gully. As if by magic, there was a soft knock at the door.\n\u201cCome in,\u201d\nJames poked his head around,\n\u201cHiya\u2026 I offered to bring the tray up, hope you don\u2019t mind?\u201d\nRemus made a helpless gesture. James looked awkward, \u201cCan I come in?\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2026 can Padfoot?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d\nJames disappeared, and Remus heard him whisper, \u2018\nGive him a bit of time, eh?\n\u2019 before reappearing and entering the room with a tray piled high with what looked like ham sandwiches.\n\u201cMum suggested soup,\u201d he explained, setting in down on the bed, \u201cBut I said you\u2019d want something meaty.\u201d\n\u201cCheers,\u201d Remus nodded, grabbing one of the rolls and stuffing it into his mouth. At least then he didn\u2019t have to talk.\n\u201cHow\u2019re you feeling?\u201d James asked, his eyes full of concern.\nRemus nodded, mouth full, to indicate that he felt perfectly fine. James nodded back.\nThis is how it will be,\nRemus thought, glumly,\nwithout Sirius to translate between us.\nJames and Remus were very good friends - best friends. They had been alone together before; had private conversations, and shared confidences. But somehow it wasn\u2019t the same. Sirius had always been the common denominator, who understood them both - bridging the gap, in a way.\n\u201cLook,\u201d James said, \u201cTell me to piss off, if you want, and I\u2019ll let you rest, but\u2026 I need to tell you something, it\u2019s important.\u201d\n\u201cIs it about Moody?\u201d Remus asked, swallowing.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d James said, \u201cYeah\u2026 he\u2019ll want to tell you, but Dad and I thought that it should come from a friend, first.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s here on ministry business, it sounds like,\u201d Remus said, carefully, wanting to understand everything so James didn\u2019t need to explain it, \u201cHe\u2019s an auror, so\u2026 has there been an attack?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d James looked like he was struggling to maintain eye contact, but he was brave, and he did what needed to be done. \u201cActually there have been a few, this summer. And some people going missing \u2013 people on our side. Then\u2026 there was another attack, last night, Remus.\u201d He put emphasis on this. Last night. The full moon.\n\u201cA werewolf.\u201d Remus breathed.\nJames nodded, his mouth a grim, straight line. Remus put down the sandwich. His stomach growled in protest, but that was just the wolf, wanting more than it deserved, as usual. It would have to starve.\n\u201cI was at St Edmund\u2019s,\u201d Remus said, desperately, \u201cThe whole time, locked up - Madam Pomfrey saw me, I can\u2019t have got out, look--\u201d He raised his shirt hurriedly, to show James the long raw gashes across his ribs.\nJames winced and looked away. Remus remembered that James had rarely ever seen his scars. It was Sirius, who had always been so fascinated.\n\u201cI know,\u201d James said, once Remus had replaced his shirt, \u201cAnd mum and dad know - Dumbledore explained everything, he told Moody there was no way you had anything to do with anything. But he\u2019ll want to talk to you, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cDid\u2026 the attack, did anyone get hurt?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. A few deaths. Some muggles, and a wizard family.\u201d\n\u201cShit.\u201d\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t have an answer for you, Prongs.\u201d\n\u201cRight. Sorry.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s your summer been?\u201d Remus asked, desperate to put off any more bad news. \u201cGood?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, not bad. Well, the war\u2019s been\u2026 but y\u2019know, loads of flying. Mary was here for a bit, too, to see Sirius--\u201d James stopped short, \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cHow is Mary?\u201d\n\u201cOh, fine. You know Mary. He um\u2026 he sent her home this morning, after we heard you were missing. It was his idea to go looking for you, he did nearly everything - even shouted at Dumbledore, I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d Remus said, coldly. James frowned,\n\u201cMoony, he\u2019s\nso\nsorry.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard.\u201d\n\u201cHe was a mess, when he heard you were missing, and about the attacks - he thought all sorts of crazy things - that you\u2019d been kidnapped, or targeted or something. Can\u2019t you\u2026 can\u2019t you at least talk to him? He\u2019s miserable.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how he feels.\u201d Remus lied. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to him.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s an idiot,\u201d James said, \u201cI\u2019m the first to admit it. He doesn\u2019t bloody think, he just does whatever comes into his head. But\u2026 well you have to remember, his family - the way they treated him, the stuff at Christmas--\u201d\n\u201cI\nknow\nwhat happened at Christmas.\u201d Remus snapped. \u201cI was there too, James.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know, but--\u201d\n\u201cAnd I felt sorry for him then, I really did. I felt sorry for him when we were kids, and every time they hurt him, and when they kicked him out; I\u2019ve spent a lot of time feeling\nso\nsorry for him. But this\u2026 this.\u201d He stopped. Tears would ruin everything. No tears.\nJames was very quiet.\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you rest.\u201d He said, finally, getting up to leave.\n* * *\nThursday 12th August 1976\nRemus didn\u2019t leave the room for the rest of the afternoon, except once to use the bathroom. It was no better than St Edmund\u2019s, he thought, self-pityingly. Better food, obviously, and magic, and quiet, but\u2026 well, he still spent all his time trying to avoid everybody, didn\u2019t he?\nMoody was still in the house, he could smell him. Moody had a strange scent, a combination of very strong, powerful magic, heavy and metallic like iron, plus something else - coal embers, or charred wood. He would not leave until he spoke with Remus, so Remus stayed put.\nSirius\u2019s scent was all too familiar - stronger in the house, now he called it home, permeating every room.\nHe\nhadn\u2019t been moping by himself all summer - no matter what James said, Sirius had the Potters, and Mary, and his best friend, all telling him how\nwonderful\nand\nhard done by\nhe was. Poor little rich boy. Probably hadn\u2019t missed Remus at all.\nExcept\u2026 James\nhad\nsaid...\nNo\n. Remus stiffened his resolve. Sirius had to pay, even if it was only in Remus\u2019s silence.\nThe next day, he went down for breakfast, more out of politeness towards his hosts than anything else. He tried his best to smile at James\u2019s mother, and thank her as she served him a bowl of porridge, but scowled when Sirius pushed the jar of honey towards him. He ignored it, and for the first time in his life ate his porridge unsweetened. It tasted crap.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go to Diagon Alley today, I think,\u201d Mrs Potter said, as the kettle boiled. \u201cYour letters arrived this morning. Remus\u2026 I\u2019m very sorry, but you\u2019ll have to stay here, dear. I\u2019ll pick up your bits.\u201d\n\u201cI get my books second hand,\u201d Remus said, flushing, \u201cFrom the supply at Hogwarts. I\u2019ve got no money.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Well, I don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m already sorting it for James and Sirius.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m paying you back!\u201d Sirius jumped in, eagerly, \u201cAs soon as I\u2019m seventeen, I promise.\u201d\n\u201cI know, dear,\u201d Mrs Potter patted Sirius\u2019s arm fondly.\n\u201cI can\u2019t pay you back.\u201d Remus said, talking to Mrs Potter, but glaring at Sirius, gritting his teeth. \u201cEven when I\u2019m seventeen.\nI\nhaven\u2019t got an inheritance.\u201d\nSirius lowered his eyes, crestfallen.\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t Remus come, mum?\u201d James jumped in, quickly. \u201cHe\u2019s never been before.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not very safe, love,\u201d Mrs Potter sighed, \u201cDumbledore and Moody both agree\u2026 after the attack.\u201d\nRemus dropped his head into his hands. He saw his life unravelling before his eyes - it would always be this way. Places he couldn\u2019t go, things he couldn\u2019t afford, friends he couldn\u2019t speak to.\nWhen the war\u2019s over, you\u2019ll still be a queer werewolf with a chip on your shoulder.\nThat nasty voice returned.\n\u201cWait,\u201d James said, suddenly, \u201cOur letters arrived?!\u201d\nRemus looked up, confused. Mrs Potter was smiling mischievously, her eyes twinkling,\n\u201cMy goodness,\u201d she said, pulling three thick envelopes from her pinafore, \u201cIf it took you that long to cotton on, then I\u2019m very concerned about your OWL results\u2026\u201d She handed each of the boys their letters, and they tore them open.\nRemus stared at the list of letters on the parchment. Weirdly, the thing that startled him most was his \u2018Acceptable\u2019 for Potions. That was definitely Lily Evans\u2019 doing. History of Magic; Outstanding, Care of Magical Creatures; Outstanding, Charms; Outstanding\u2026 and the rest; Exceeds Expectations. A flutter of excitement started up in his midriff. These were bloody good results.\n\u201cYes, Moony, you beauty!\u201d James cheered, reading over his shoulder.\n\u201cH-how did you do?\u201d Remus asked, bashfully. James handed over his paper - he\u2019d got almost entirely Exceeds Expectations, and two Outstandings - one in Defence Against the Dark Arts and the other in Transfiguration.\n\u201cGo and show you father!\u201d Mrs Potter said, after kissing her son gleefully. Mr Potter had not yet left his study, as far as Remus could tell. James took him a plate of toast, too.\nSirius was looking at Remus across the table, biting his lip.\n\u201cYou did well, then?\u201d He asked, tentatively. Remus nodded curtly,\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty happy, yeah.\u201d He desperately wanted to know how Sirius had done \u2013 mostly to find out if he\u2019d done better in History of Magic. Luckily, he didn\u2019t need to ask. Sirius slid his parchment across the table. Remus craned his neck to look at it.\nThey had achieved exactly the same number of OWLs, in different subjects. Sirius\u2019s \u2018Outstanding\u2019 grades had come in Transfiguration, Defence Against the Dark Arts and \u2013 incredibly \u2013 Muggle Studies. Remus tried not to smile at this. Instead he glanced up at Sirius coolly and said,\n\u201cI beat you in History.\u201d\n* \u00a0* *\nMrs Potter and the boys left shortly after breakfast, and Remus was alone. He went outside, into the garden and sat on the edge of the low patio wall, staring out at their acres of green open land. He pulled out his fags. Only three left. He could maybe go into town later and buy some \u2013 he had a bit of shrapnel in his back pocket. Too tall to steal, these days.\n\u201cLupin.\u201d\nRemus hoped his shoulders hadn\u2019t stiffened too visibly at the sound of that gruff voice. He turned, slowly,\n\u201cAll right, Moody?\u201d He was glad to have the cigarette. Something to hide behind.\n\u201cMay I join you?\u201d\nRemus shrugged. Moody sat down on the wall beside him. \u201cLovely day.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, t\u2019riffic\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt the Potter boy\u2019s spilled the beans on the werewolf attack?\u201d\nRemus nodded, appreciating Alastor\u2019s bluntness.\nLet\u2019s get this over with.\n\u201cYep.\u201d He exhaled, slowly, making a smoke ring. \u201cWhat\u2019d you want to ask me? You know I was locked up.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken with Albus and Poppy, they both confirmed your whereabouts.\u201d\n\u201cYippee.\u201d Remus said, sarcastically. Moody gave him a stern look with his still functioning eye.\n\u201cWe have suspects, though. One in particular, someone you might have heard of.\u201d\nRemus went cold, his hands began to shake. He pretended he was just flicking ash.\n\u201cGreyback?\u201d He asked, his voice colourless.\n\u201cGreyback.\u201d Moody confirmed. Remus stubbed out the cigarette and gripped the wall with both hands, as if he might fall.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was\u2026 I hadn\u2019t heard of him attacking anyone in a long time. I thought he was abroad, somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cBeen doing your research, have you?\u201d Moody said, a note of challenge in his voice, \u201cCan\u2019t say I blame you, lad. I\u2019d want to know everything I could. He\u2019s not tried to contact you, then?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Remus was shocked. Why on earth?!\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve done your research properly \u2013 and Dumbledore says you\u2019re clever - then you\u2019ll know Greyback has a particular penchant for children?\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d Remus had to stop himself from touching the ancient scar on his side, those eleven year old teeth marks.\n\u201cNever wondered why?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a monster.\u201d Remus said, firmly. He fumbled with his cigarette packet \u2013 he needed another one, to keep steady. What he wouldn\u2019t give for a spliff.\n\u201cHe is,\u201d Moody agreed, \u201cBut he\u2019s got a motive, mad as it seems. We\u2019ve reason to believe that he likes to turn kids young, so he can show up when they\u2019re old enough - and strong enough - to join him.\u201d\n\u201c\nJoin\nhim?!\u201d\n\u201cIn his mind, he\u2019s your father.\u201d Moody said, as if it was nothing, \u201cHe\u2019ll want you to\u2026 take up the family trade, as it were.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting.\u201d Remus stood up, practically shouting.\n\u201cIt is.\u201d Moody replied, unperturbed. \u201cBut you need to be aware. Greyback hasn\u2019t been seen in Britain since the last person he turned.\u201d Here, he gave Remus a very pointed look. \u201cBut a wizarding family was killed last night \u2013 all except their youngest child, who was bitten, but survived. A dark mark had been cast above the house.\u201d\nHe was definitely working with Voldemort, then. Just brilliant.\n\u201cIs this why I can\u2019t go to Diagon Alley?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s best if you stay away from wizard populated areas for a while. \u2018Til we catch him.\u201d\n\u201cHogwarts?\u201d\n\u201cHogwarts is safe,\u201d Moody said, \u201cBut not Hogsmeade. I\u2019m asking Dumbledore to keep you away.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Ok.\u201d\n\u201cAnd no more running away.\u201d\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t\u2026 that was about something else.\u201d Remus sighed. Then he thought of something. \u201cWhat happened to the kid? The one that was bitten?\u201d He raised his cigarette to his lips and sucked \u2013 but realised he hadn\u2019t lit it. Moody snapped his fingers, and it ignited immediately.\n\u201cAt St. Mungo\u2019s.\u201d The auror said. \u201cBeing treated. They\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cOh, will they?\u201d Remus could have laughed. He looked out across the fields again. It was such a beautiful day. \u201cUntil the next moon, I s\u2019pose.\u201d\n\u201cThe right people got there in time. We\u2019ll do what we can.\u201d\nThe right people. Remus wondered whether the \u2018right people\u2019 had been responsible for his being carted off to St Edmund\u2019s. \u201cWe have a mutual friend.\u201d Moody said, out of the blue.\n\u201cHm?\u201d Remus frowned at him.\n\u201cLeo Ferox. Good man.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right \u2013 how do you know him?\u201d\n\u201cWe were at school together. Cross paths at work, sometimes - and of course working with Dumbledore. I hear you and your pals are planning to join up yourselves, that right?\u201d\nRemus had the impression that Moody knew the answer to this, and just wanted Remus to confirm it himself.\n\u201cYes.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI know I\u2019m not James, or\u2026 but I\u2019m not bad at duelling, and if I can help, I want to.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re anything like your father you\u2019ll be more than a help.\u201d\nRemus nodded, glumly. How was he supposed to know whether he was anything like his father? What a stupid thing to say.\n\u201cDunno about that.\u201d He said, bitterly, \u201cI have a few limitations my father didn\u2019t have.\u201d\n\u201cCould look at it that way,\u201d Moody tilted his head. \u201cCould look at it another way. How many werewolves do you think we\u2019ve got on our side?\u201d\nRemus frowned, as if Moody had sworn at him. Is that why Dumbledore kept him so close? Is that why he hadn\u2019t alerted the ministry as soon as Remus was reported missing? He didn\u2019t know if that was better or worse. At least someone thought he was useful."

            "summary_and_notes": "",
            "content": "It wasn't easy for Remus to keep Sirius at a distance while he was staying with the Potters. The house was big enough, but that didn\u2019t matter much in a family home; something Remus was only just learning. Mrs Potter gave Remus his space during the first couple of days, but after that it was clear that she had no idea of the rift between the marauders, and expected the three boys to spend all of their time together as usual.\nAs much as they were each uncomfortable with this arrangement, for their own reasons, none of them wanted to disappoint or worry Euphemia. So an uneasy truce was struck, and Remus spent most of his time reading his book, sitting close enough to James and Sirius that it did not look suspicious.\nGrant had said that it wouldn't always hurt - and though he hadn\u2019t had the full facts of the situation, Remus was starting to believe him. He still felt very angry towards Sirius - but it hurt less, as the final weeks of summer drained away in a flood of sunshine and blue skies. He was able, at least, to be civil, and Sirius seemed grateful. At any rate, he had stopped trying to corner Remus into a conversation every five minutes.\nBesides, after his conversation with Moody, Remus had other things occupying his mind. For years now, he had been labouring under the assumption that Greyback did not know him, that he would have the element of surprise in his corner. But now it seemed that Greyback might be looking for him, too. He would not tell the marauders this, not until he knew more. No use getting them worried; if Moody said that Hogwarts was safe, then Remus was inclined to believe him for now. The Potters clearly trusted him, and that would have to be enough. What was more; he knew Ferox.\nRemus had had Ferox on his mind too. Once again, his old professor seemed like the safest option when it came to asking questions. He understood Remus\u2019s need to know more - even if he didn't know\nwhy\n, exactly. And Remus didn\u2019t want to bother Mr Potter, not when he seemed to have the weight of the world on his shoulders already. He would send an owl to Ferox as soon as he was back at school - and as soon as the dust had settled on this recent revelation.\nIn the meantime, Peter came over every day, and they went out on their brooms, or else lounged about on the lawn, smoking, listening to Sirius\u2019s record player and sunbathing. Remus turned a warm hazelnut brown all over, which made him look healthier than he ever had, and his hair bleached a shade fairer.\nOn the penultimate day of the holidays, they were doing just this - it was too hot to move, and all four of them were lying on their backs baking in the sun. Remus had positioned himself a little further away from the others, just to show Sirius that he was not off the hook. (Also because Sirius had an annoying habit of taking his shirt off, and Remus was trying not to notice.)\n\u201cSo tell me again,\u201d Peter yawned up at the sun, arms behind his head, \u201cWhat was the Knight Bus like? I\u2019ve always wanted to go on it.\u201d\n\u201cDream big, Petey.\u201d Sirius drawled.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that great,\u201d James replied, \u201cCan\u2019t wait until we can all apparate - lessons start in January.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be rubbish at it.\u201d Peter said, forlorn, \u201cDezzie has been reading the theory books, I can\u2019t get my head around it.\u201d\n\u201cWell it's better than relying on that stupid bus.\u201d James removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes, \u201cIt\u2019s fine for magical locations, but the driver kept getting lost on the way to St Edmund\u2019s.\u201d\nRemus\u2019s stomach flipped. He really, really hated the idea that James and Sirius had been there. He felt as though they\u2019d seen some private part of him he would have preferred to keep hidden. Like the first time he\u2019d transformed in front of them.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I missed that too.\u201d Peter sighed. \u201cWere there loads of muggles? What was it like?\u201d\n\u201cC\u2019mon Pete,\u201d James said, \u201cThat\u2019s Moony\u2019s home you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Remus said.\n\u201cI bet it's great, living with loads of other people your age,\u201d James said, encouragingly. It was James\u2019s greatest sorrow that he had grown up an only child.\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d Remus looked for the right word. \u201cIt\u2019s noisy. Did you go inside?\u201d\n\u201cPadfoot did, crawled under a hole in the back fence.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t go in the building, though.\u201d Sirius said, rolling onto his front. The muscles in his back moved smoothly under his skin and Remus had to fight not to bite his lip. \u201cSome bitch started throwing stones at me.\u201d\n\u201cMatron.\u201d Remus confirmed.\n\u201cMust\u2019ve been.\u201d Sirius nodded, obviously pleased at the attention, \u201cIf she treats people the way she treats dogs then I don\u2019t blame you for running away.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn't really about her.\u201d Remus said, pointedly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s lucky Prongs and Padfoot found you though, eh Moony?\u201d Peter smiled, blissfully ignorant, \u201cOtherwise you\u2019d be lost in muggle London!\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t lost.\u201d Remus said, icily, putting his book down finally. \u201cI was with a friend.\u201d\n\u201cBut James said--\u201d\n\u201cI said he was in a squat, Pete, not alone. He was with this muggle chap - sorry Remus, I\u2019ve forgotten his name..?\u201d\n\u201cHe didn't tell us his name.\u201d Sirius said, out of nowhere. Remus sat up and squinted at him. Sirius was staring at him in a strange way, but it only brought Remus\u2019s hackles up.\n\u201cNo.\u201d He replied, \u201cI didn't.\u201d He got to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m going in, it's too hot.\u201d\nJames, who seemed to have grasped that the conversation had taken an unpleasant turn, got up too.\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right Moony. Shall we all go in for a bit? Have a drink and do that washing up mum wanted sorting. She\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d\nMrs Potter had left for the afternoon on an errand, and Mr Potter was at work. Gully was in the house somewhere, of course, but he never made his presence known unless summoned. The boys were pretty much alone.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go home if you\u2019re going to do\nchores\n,\u201d Peter grumbled, struggling to his own feet, \u201cI can do housework at mine.\u201d\n\u201cCheer up Wormy,\u201d James slapped him on his sweaty shoulder, \u201cThere\u2019re jam tarts in the kitchen, you can have the marmalade one if you want.\u201d\nThe four of them strolled back across the crisp brittle lawn to the house, stopping at the shed so that Sirius and James could put their brooms away first. Pete went straight in for his tart, and Remus hung back on the patio, between them all, feeling very put out and agitated. He sat on the low brick wall again and listened to Sirius and James\u2019s cheerful banter from inside the shed.\n\u201cI ought to polish the handle again before I pack it away\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBloody hell Prongs, you polish it twice a day already.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s called looking after your equipment, Black.\u201d\n\u201cI call it sexual frustration.\u201d\n\u201cPiss off!\u201d\nThere was a scuffle, and Remus could hear Sirius\u2019s gleeful cackling as the two boys wrestled. \u201cWait \u2018til we\u2019re back at school and I can curse your bollocks off!\u201d James laughed,\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare -\nsome\nof us use our bollocks!\u201d\n\u201cYou tosser! I ought to - oh shit, watch out\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAh!\u201d Sirius cried, \u201cBugger! That hurt.\u201d\nThey both staggered back out into the daylight, Sirius clutching his hand.\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d James asked, peering over. He paled, upon seeing Sirius\u2019s hand, and backed away, \u201cSorry mate, you know how I am with blood\u2026\u201d\n\u201cEurgh, it\u2019s really bleeding, too\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOi, get away from me!\u201d\n\u201cWhat shall I do? Wait \u2018til your mum gets home?\u201d\n\u201cNo choice - I dunno any healing spells...\u201d\n\u201cOw, it bloody hurts\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, for god\u2019s sake,\u201d Remus stood up, squinting. \u201cLet me see.\u201d\nSirius and James both turned to look at him. Sirius\u2019s eyes flickered to James, then back to Remus, before he walked over, hand outstretched. The cut was very deep, blood running in rivulets down Sirius\u2019s long white wrists.\nRemus swallowed, \u201cYou need to clean that, it\u2019ll get infected\u2026 hang on, I\u2019ve got some stuff in my trunk.\u201d\nHe led Sirius through the kitchen, upstairs to the first floor bathroom and turned on the cold tap. He had some TCP in his trunk leftover from St Edmund\u2019s, where he often had to look after his own scrapes when Madam Pomfrey wasn\u2019t around. He brought it through, along with some cotton balls and gauze.\n\u201cCome here.\u201d He said, sitting on the edge if the bathtub and motioning that Sirius sit on the closed toilet seat. He obeyed, still holding his hand out warily.\nIt was much cooler, in the bathroom, reassuringly sterile, like the hospital wing. Remus found that very calming. Sirius was placid and docile, trusting Remus completely with watchful eyes, like a pet.\n\u201cWhat's that?\u201d He asked as Remus tipped some disinfectant onto the cotton.\n\u201cTCP.\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019ll clean the wound.\u201d\n\u201cIs it muggle stuff?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it will work just the same,\u201d Remus raised an eyebrow. He took Sirius\u2019s wrist, gripping it more roughly than he really needed to. His skin was hot from the sun. Remus could feel his pulse. \u201cIt\u2019s going to sting.\u201d He said, as he pressed down. Sirius flinched, and Remus was reminded of the time after Christmas they\u2019d spent in the Potter\u2019s bathroom, piercing Sirius\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cWill it hurt??\u201d Sirius panicked at the last minute, as Remus was poised with the pin.\n\n\n\u201cWell we\u2019ve numbed it a bit, but yeah, probably.\u201d Remus said, matter-of-factly. \u201cDon\u2019t be such a girl.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBe gentle with me, Moony!\u201d\n\n\nThey had both laughed, and Remus shook him fondly;\n\n\n\u201cStay still you big wuss.\u201d\n\nHe finished cleaning the wound and then wrapped it in gauze, taping it neatly.\n\u201cProbably throb a bit.\u201d He explained. \u201cMeant to be tight. Stops the bleeding.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Moony.\u201d\n\u201cAny time.\u201d Remus went to get up, placing both hands on the cold porcelain of the tub. Sirius suddenly reached out and touched his arm.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Remus replied. \u201cYou\u2019ve said.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I did\u2026\u201d Sirius licked his lips nervously, still grasping Remus\u2019s arm as if that was the only thing keeping him in place.\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Remus frowned, his resolve weakening.\n\u201cBut we ought to talk--\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d Remus said, simply. \u201cI can\u2019t, anyway. There are no words for what you did to me.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sirius hung his head. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He let go, but Remus didn\u2019t walk away, though he knew he ought to. Sirius ran his uninjured hand through his hair in frustration. \u201cI\u2019m such an idiot.\u201d He said.\nRemus did not refute this. Sirius continued. \u201cIt was a really good year, wasn\u2019t it, fifth year? Spending the moons together, and the parties\u2026 then I went and ballsed it all up.\u201d\n\u201cWell.\u201d Remus relented. \u201cI made some mistakes too. I made things\u2026 things were different, after my birthday.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Moony, no!\u201d Sirius\u2019s eyes widened. He looked so earnest and sincere that Remus wanted to forgive everything in an instant. \u201cI know I wasn\u2019t\u2026 you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. That, what happened on your birthday, it was\u2026\u201d\nRemus held his breath while Sirius searched for the word. \u201c...it was really brave.\u201d Sirius finished.\nRemus blinked. Brave?! What on earth was that supposed to mean? Sirius saw his reaction, and tried to cover his tracks,\n\u201cI just mean that you shouldn't worry about it. It didn\u2019t\u2026\nthat\ndidn\u2019t change anything, ok?\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d Remus looked down, then \u2013 feeling braver, looked up again. \u201cWe never talked about that.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re my best friend, Remus.\u201d\n\u201cSirius, please\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I know what I did. There aren\u2019t words, no, so I\u2019ll shut up and I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll do actions, instead, ok? I\u2019ll prove I\u2019m sorry, every day. I swear, I\u2019ll never do another stupid thing without thinking again.\u201d\nRemus gave him a small smile,\n\u201cCome on.\u201d\nSirius smiled too, looking relieved.\n\u201cYeah, ok, maybe a bit ambitious. I\u2019ll never do anything to hurt any one of my friends, ever again, how\u2019s that?\u201d\nRemus breathed in deeply. Forgiveness would be such a blessed relief.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a start.\u201d"

            "content": "Wednesday 1st September 1976\n\n\n\u201cThis is the year, lads. This is the year it finally happens. Six years of waiting and it all pays off.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be talking about what I think you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Remus raised an eyebrow over to top of his book.\n\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d James was beaming like a drunkard, \u201cLily Evans is\n\n\ndefinitely\n\n\ngoing to realise she\u2019s mad about me. I can feel it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you sure, though?\u201d Sirius smirked, \u201cYou\u2019ve had these feelings before.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI have,\u201d James nodded, respectfully, \u201cYou\u2019re quite right, Padfoot. But something is different this time. I can practically taste it. Love is very much in the air.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOr lust,\u201d Remus muttered, flipping his page over, \u201cYou\u2019re probably just picking up on the raging hormones coming off these idiots.\u201d He nodded at Sirius and Peter, who both kept glancing out of the train window, looking for their respective girlfriends.\n\n\n\u201cWho\u2019re you calling an idiot, Moony?\u201d Sirius retorted, \u201cI can\u2019t help it if I drive women wild with desire.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSIRIUS BLOODY BLACK, I COULD KILL YOU!\u201d Mary\u2019s furious shriek could have shattered glass. Sirius practically leapt two feet off his seat.\n\n\nRemus gave a satisfied nod.\n\n\n\u201cWild with something, anyway.\u201d\n\n\nJames guffawed, nearly choking on the Bertie Botts every flavour bean he had been chewing.\n\n\nNo one was happier about Remus and Sirius\u2019s reconciliation than James. He didn\u2019t say anything directly, but as soon as he recognised that his two best friends were no longer keeping each other at arm's length, he was grinning from ear to ear, back to his usual mischievous self. And therefore,\n\n\n\nback to sighing over Lily Evans.\n\n\nLily entered the carriage at this point, just behind Mary who had burst in like a whirlwind. Lily smiled at Remus and took the spare seat beside him, he smiled back and they settled in to watch the show.\n\n\n\u201cWhat have I done?!\u201d Sirius asked, affronted.\n\n\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t know, do you?!\u201d Mary stood with her hands on her hips, a look of disgust on her face. She looked spectacular when she was angry, her gold hoop earrings jangled, her kohl rimmed eyes were wide and fiery. \u201cDiagon Alley?!\u201d She stamped her foot.\n\n\nSirius\u2019s eyes widened.\n\n\n\u201cBugger.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFuck you, Black!\u201d Mary turned and stormed back out. Sirius scrambled up to follow her down the corridor, just as the train started moving,\n\n\n\u201cOi, Mary, wait! I\u2019m sorry..!\u201d\n\n\nRemus turned to Lily,\n\n\n\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cForgot her birthday,\u201d Lily grinned, \u201cApparently they had a plan to meet in Diagon Alley and she waited for two hours\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh bollocks,\u201d James slapped his forehead, \u201cI was supposed to remind him\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re as bad as each other,\u201d Lily snorted. \u201cGodric save the girls stupid enough to marry any of you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHas anyone seen Desdemona?\u201d Peter asked, distractedly. Lily shook her head and the boys shrugged. Peter got up, \u201cI\u2019ll see you lot later\u2026\u201d and wandered out of the carriage.\n\n\n\u201cBloody hell.\u201d James said, \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to the marauders?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOi, I\u2019m here,\u201d Remus said, returning to his book.\n\n\n\u201cMy only true friend!\u201d James smiled, \u201cYou\u2019ll never leave me for a girl, will you, Moony?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo chance,\u201d Remus replied, turning the page again.\n\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d Lily yelped, grabbing Remus\u2019s shoulder, \u201c\n\n\nThat\u2019s\n\n\nwhy they call you Moony?!\u201d\n\n\nRemus gave her a sideways grin and nodded very slightly. Lily looked amazed,\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t work it out sooner!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d James frowned, \u201cWorked what out? It's just an in joke, right, Remus? Some stupid thing we came up with as kids, no big secret or any-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cProngs,\u201d Remus shook his head, laughing, \u201cIt\u2019s fine; she knows.\u201d\n\n\nJames\u2019 hazel eyes widened, and he stared at them both. Lily giggled, her eyes teasing and Remus suddenly saw exactly why she drove James so crazy.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot, Potter. But at least you can keep a secret.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, of course,\u201d James straightened his back and puffed out his chest, \u201cWe\u2019d all do anything for Moony.\u201d\n\n\nRemus was really quite touched by that, and had to raise his book to hide his face. He hoped Lily knew that James was being quite honest, and not just showing off for her approval. The compartment door slid open and Marlene entered. She\u2019d had her hair cut into a neat bob over the summer, like Mia Farrow. It was very becoming. She smiled and nodded at her friends, sitting down next to James.\n\n\n\u201cSirius and Mary are having a proper screaming match out there, it's mental.\u201d She looked at Lily, then James, then Remus, \u201cWhat have I missed?\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nMary forgave Sirius by the time they reached Hogwarts, on the promise that he would take her for a day in Hogsmeade to make up for it. Remus was pleased - he could honestly, truly say that, without bitterness. He felt that Sirius had drawn a line under their kiss, back in the Potter\u2019s bathroom, and it was up to him, Remus, to honour and respect that line.\n\n\nSirius liked Mary. Remus would just have to get over it, that's all. And yes, fine, sometimes Remus fantasised about kissing the hollow of Sirius\u2019s collar bone, about tracing a line from the pit of his throat down to his naval - so what?! That was purely Remus\u2019s problem. He\u2019d have to focus his\n\n\nattentions elsewhere. Perhaps Christopher had become dazzlingly attractive over\n\n\n\nthe summer.\n\n\nThe feast and the sorting was as magnificent and reassuringly predictable as ever. The friends chatted about their new timetables (Lily was extremely disappointed to find out that Remus had chosen to drop Potions, but he promised to keep giving her a run for her money in Charms), their summers\n\n\n\n(tactfully avoiding Mary\u2019s birthday) and the looming pressure of NEWTs. All blissfully normal, Remus thought to himself as they finished their puddings and got up, yawning, ready for bed.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m knackered,\u201d James said, stretching, \u201cEarly night tonight, eh, Marlene? Practice first thing--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh no you don\u2019t, Potter, you\u2019re coming with me.\u201d Lily said, sternly. He blinked, as if he couldn't believe his luck. She frowned, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to lead the first years to bed - have you\n\n\nalready\n\n\nforgotten you\u2019re a prefect?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh shit, yeah -- I mean bugger-- I mean\u2026 whoops.\u201d\n\n\nLily tutted, getting up,\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll work on your language, too. Come on.\u201d She looked at the others, \u201cPassword\u2019s \u2018lion heart\u2019.\u201d\n\n\nThey thanked her, and went on ahead, leaving James behind, looking confused but grateful.\n\n\nSirius flung himself into the largest, comfiest couch in the common room, taking up enough space for three people. Mary joined him with an indulgent smile, settling her little feet across his legs. Peter and Marlene started a game of chess on the carpet in front of the fire, and Remus picked up his book.\n\n\nEverything as it should be\n\n\n, he smiled peacefully.\n\n\nA chapter in, Sirius evidently grew bored.\n\n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s our first party, then?\u201d He asked the general room.\n\n\n\u201cOur first match is in November,\u201d Marlene said from the floor, her eyes on the game. You couldn\u2019t look away for a moment when you were playing Peter \u2013 no one knew how he did it. \u201cYou can organise the victory party if you want, Black.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s aaages away.\u201d Mary purred, \u201cHalloween? Close to your birthday. We can do it after the feast.\u201d\n\n\nRemus\u2019s stomach rumbled at the mention of a feast. He put down his book,\n\n\n\u201cWonder if there\u2019s time to go down to the kitchens\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly be hungry,\u201d Sirius arched an eyebrow, \u201cYou had three helpings of pudding!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d Remus sighed and settled back into the armchair. He shifted sideways, dangling his long legs over the end, kicking off his dirty tennis shoes, and returned to his book. It was Dickens \u2013\n\n\nThe Pickwick Papers\n\n\n\u2013 and funny, but dry, so that you had to really focus in order to actually find the funny bits. Unfortunately, a full stomach, a long day and a warm fireplace were not conducive to concentration, and Remus soon dozed off.\n\n\nIt must have been only half an hour that had passed, when Remus snapped awake at the sound of raucous laughter.\n\n\n\u201cStay\n\n\nstill\n\n\nPotter!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying!\u201d\n\n\nRemus blinked a few times, confused and groggy. He stared around to find Peter and Marlene rolling on the hearth rug giggling, Mary standing next to Lily near the portrait hole, where James appeared to be performing a very complicated and vigorous Irish jig. Remus smiled sleepily, and straightened up, his back sore from sleeping all folded up like a deck chair. He turned left, just to get the gristle in his neck to pop, and caught Sirius watching him with a soft, unconscious smile. Remus raised an eyebrow, which seemed to break the spell, and Sirius blinked, then looked away, quickly.\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Mary was asking, with hands on her hips,\n\n\n\u201cSilly prat was showing off, as per usual. His hex hit a suit of armour and backfired.\u201d Lily was half laughing, half trying to corner James for long enough to perform the counter jinx.\n\n\n\u201cWho were you trying to hex?!\u201d Sirius stood up now, crossing the room.\n\n\n\u201cBloody Mulciber,\u201d James said, a comical frown on his face as his legs flew about energetically beneath him,\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nPetrificus Totalus\n\n\n,\u201d Sirius said, with a yawn. James froze still, and fell to the ground as stiff as a board.\n\n\n\u201cBlack!\u201d Lily sighed\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Sirius grinned, \u201cI was only trying to help!\u201d\n\n\nRemus giggled, still stretching. It was probably time for bed. He got up slowly, as Sirius, Mary and Lily stood over James, arguing over which spell to break first - the dancing one or the petrifying one - and sirius was in favour of simply levitating him up to bed as he was.\n\n\nJust as Remus was heading in the direction of the boys dormitory, he caught sight of Christopher. The fifth year boy was coming down the stairs, with a shiny silver prefects badge pinned proudly to his chest. Unfortunately, Christopher had\n\n\nnot\n\n\nbecome incredibly good looking over the summer - in fact, quite the opposite. He had obviously been somewhere very hot and sunny over the summer, and his pale English skin was scorched bright red and peeling grotesquely at his nose.\n\n\nThey stared at each other for a moment, before Christopher looked at his feet, then walked away without a word. Remus felt the sting of guilt. He\u2019d have to apologise, at some point.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nWednesday 8\n\nth\n\nSeptember 1976\n\n\n\u201cWith your OWLs now behind you, and your NEWTs over a year away,\n\n\ndo not\n\n\nfall into the trap of believing that this will be an easy year. Your sixth year lays the foundation for your advanced exams, and the work you do will be pivotal in determining the opportunities available to you once you leave school\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus fought not to yawn. He might have felt nervous, worried, spurred into action \u2013 and he had been. The first time he\u2019d heard this speech. They were halfway through their first week of sixth year, and so far every teacher had performed some variation on this address. This morning, the lecture was being given by Professor Flitwick, and therefore made mildly more interesting because of his squeaky little voice.\n\n\nRemus looked out of the window. It was the full moon tonight, and he was restless. He had a horrible feeling about it, as well as the usual early twinges and surges of adrenaline. \u00a0It was the first full moon he would be spending with the marauders since that terrible night in June. It was the first full moon after the werewolf attack in August \u2013 since he had run away from St Edmund\u2019s.\n\n\nThe murders played heavy on his mind. The family was called Munday \u2013 both parents had been muggle born. It had been in the papers, and Remus had read everything he could while he was at the Potters. He\u2019d searched high and low for mention of Greyback, for a picture, a description \u2013\n\n\nanything\n\n\n. If this\u2026 man was after him, then he needed to be armed with information. But there was nothing. The press wasn\u2019t publishing anything more than Moody had already told him.\n\n\nThe letter to Ferox had been written for almost a week now. It was burning a hole in Remus\u2019s back pocket. He\u2019d been waiting to get a chance to sneak off to the owlery on his own.\n\n\n\nDear Professor Ferox,\n\n\n\n[he knew that Ferox wasn\u2019t a professor any more, but he didn\u2019t know what else to call him, and couldn\u2019t bring himself to address him as anything so familiar as \u2018Leo\u2019.]\n\n\n\nI hope it\u2019s ok for me to write to you. I had a few questions and I couldn\u2019t think of anyone else who might know. I spoke to Alastor Moody while I was staying with the Potters this summer, and he said you\u2019re well. I hope you aren\u2019t anywhere too dangerous.\n\n\n\n\nMoody told me that the Munday family were murdered by Greyback. He said that Greyback might try to find me, and get me to join him. I hope you know I would never join that side. I do want to be prepared if he comes after me, though. Can you tell me anything useful? I don\u2019t even know what he looks like.\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry to bother you with this, but you are the only person I can ask, because you knew my dad, and you know me.\n\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\n\n\nRemus J. Lupin.\n\n\n\nHe knew that you were supposed to end letters \u2018yours sincerely\u2019 or \u2018yours faithfully\u2019, or something like that, but it seemed so silly and formal. He worried that Ferox might think he was trying too hard to seem grown up.\n\n\n\u201cMoony? Wakey wakey!\u201d Sirius shook his shoulder.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Remus looked up, blinking and dazed. Sirius was standing over him, and everyone else was packing up their things,\n\n\n\u201cLesson\u2019s over, dopey. Where did you wander off to?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust distracted,\u201d Remus replied. He stood up and scooped his own assortment of quills and parchment into his book back, getting up.\n\n\nSirius\u2019s face softened. He leaned in and said very low,\n\n\n\u201cIs it because of tonight? Are you nervous?\u201d\n\n\nRemus gave a sort of half shrug, half reassuring smile,\n\n\n\u201cNo more than usual.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a free now,\u201d Sirius said, chirpily - he was very much enjoying his NEWT timetable, having dropped four subjects. \u201cWant to pop round the greenhouses?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d Remus grinned, \u201cS\u2019ok. I actually\u2026 I have to go to the owlery. Got a letter to post.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah? I\u2019ll come with you, James has\n\n\nanother\n\n\nponcey prefect meeting. I swear you never went to this many meetings,\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNah, I sort of left it all up to Evans, to be honest,\u201d Remus smirked, \u201cOf course,\n\n\nI\n\n\nwasn\u2019t trying to impress her.\u201d\n\n\nSirius laughed,\n\n\n\u201cToo bloody right - at least\n\n\nyou\n\n\nknow where your priorities are, Moony. Who\u2019s the letter for?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 do you mind not asking?\u201d Remus looked down, as they left the classroom, walking with a slightly longer stride than usual so that Sirius would have to walk faster to keep up. It was a cheap trick, but there had to be some benefits to being tall.\n\n\n\u201cOh, of course, mate.\u201d Sirius nodded respectfully, \u201cDon\u2019t mind me, I\u2019m just bored, y\u2019know.\u201d\n\n\nHe had been extremely pliant lately, eager to supply Remus with any allowances he requested. Remus thought he could probably get away with snogging Mary on the Gryffindor dinner table with Sirius\u2019s blessing, the way things were.\n\n\nThey tramped up to the owlery quickly - with the moon waxing Remus\u2019s energy levels were through the roof - then going single file up the final narrow winding staircase.\n\n\nThe owlery was a beautiful place, by anyone\u2019s standards (provided you ignored the smell of bird shit) with the very best view of anywhere else in the castle. It was a bright and airy space with high rafters, filled with the soft sounds of roosting owls. Sirius dutifully hung back a respectable distance as Remus selected the sturdiest looking owl (he had no idea where Ferox was, or how far away, and wanted a bird that was up to the job), attached his letter, and released it through the huge picture window.\n\n\nSirius was leaning out of the window on the opposite side, staring down at the forbidden forest.\n\n\n\u201cHow far d\u2019you reckon we got, last year?\u201d He asked, \u201cCouple of miles, at least\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAt least,\u201d Remus agreed, joining him at the windowsill.\n\n\n\u201cThink we could reach those mountains? There\u2019re caves, I bet. I used to quite fancy living in a cave, when I was little. Me and Reggie were going to run away from home and become cave dwellers.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWeirdo,\u201d Remus shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019d be freezing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, well you don\u2019t think about that stuff when you\u2019re seven, do you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI s\u2019pose. I never actually thought about running away, to be honest. Lots of boys actually did it, but the police normally brought them back. Matron used to say that if one of us went missing it was no skin off her nose - she still got paid, at the end of the week.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMoony, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus laughed, and moved away,\n\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s get out of here, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\n\n\nThey began a slightly slower descent down the spiral staircase, but had to stop halfway as they heard footsteps coming up. Remus\u2019s stomach sank when he saw it was Christopher. He\u2019d recovered a bit from his sunburn, but still had a bit of a hot glow around his cheeks and nose. He froze when he saw Sirius, with Remus just behind him.\n\n\nThe two boys flattened themselves against the wall as best they could to let him past.\n\n\n\u201cHi, Chris,\u201d Remus smiled, politely.\n\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d Christopher responded, not making eye contact. Ah. He was definitely still annoyed about the way Remus had spoken to him at the end of last term. Remus had been worried about that - but he supposed he deserved a bit of cold shoulder. The silver pin gleamed on Chris\u2019s robes, and Remus tried not to wince. He could feel it in his teeth, a giddy, sick sensation.\n\n\n\u201cWell done on getting prefect,\u201d he said, trying to sound friendly and encouraging.\n\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026 thanks.\u201d Christopher nodded. he still didn\u2019t look up, exactly, but he sort of looked at the space over Remus\u2019s left shoulder, and gave a weak smile as he passed.\n\n\nThe close proximity to the silver was extremely unpleasant, and Remus\u2019s head swam, making him dizzy. As Christopher pushed past them both, Remus wobbled forward and had to grip Sirius\u2019s shoulder to keep balanced. He had to concentrate on his breathing to avoid fainting altogether until Christopher had reached the owlery, and barely noticed that Sirius had slipped a strong arm around his back for support.\n\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, and the wooziness had passed, Remus thought it must only have been a few seconds that they had stood like that, clinging to each other in the shadowy stairway. (\n\n\nMust stop getting stuck in confined spaces with him,\n\n\nthe logical part of Remus\u2019s brain scolded.) He realised he had been gripping Sirius\u2019s shoulder really quite hard, and let go quickly, stepping away and adjusting his robes.\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, \u201cTook me by surprise,\u201d\n\n\n\u201cS\u2019ok,\u201d Sirius smiled, turning and walking down the stairs again, \u201cAnother reason to hate prefects, eh?\u201d"

            "content": "Saturday 9th October 1976\n\u201cUgh,\u201d Remus staggered to his feet as the transformation completed and his body settled back into its human form.\n\u201cThat didn't seem too bad?\u201d James said, having just transformed himself.\n\u201cDepends what you mean by bad,\u201d Remus grimaced, pulling his trousers on quickly.\nJames looked away, politely to preserve his modesty, and Sirius, still a dog, padded over with Remus\u2019s shirt in his mouth, offering it up with a cocked head. \u201cCheers, Padfoot,\u201d Remus smiled. He wanted to pat the dog on the head, and had to keep reminding himself that this was Sirius.\n\u201cThank merlin it\u2019s Saturday,\u201d James yawned, taking a seat on the beaten-up couch. It sagged drearily beneath him, springs wheezing.\n\u201cYeah, if Madam Pomfrey lets me off the hospital wing, I\u2019ll probably go straight to bed anyway,\u201d Remus replied, stifling his own yawn, and laying down on his cot.\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d Peter said, appearing as if from nowhere, in a far corner of the room, \u201cS\u2019posed to be taking Dezzie to Hogsmeade at eleven. Prongs, don\u2019t you have to lead the third years down?\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d James yawned again, noisily, \u201cNow Evans knows about Remus\u2019s furry little problem she\u2019s actually cutting me some slack. That fifth year kid with the sunburn is doing it instead.\u201d\n\u201cEvans doesn\u2019t know anything else, does she?\u201d Sirius finally reappeared, joining James on the couch.\nJames shook his head, leaning back on the couch and closing his eyes. \u201cOi,\u201d Sirius nudged him, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go, soon, don\u2019t sleep.\u201d\n\u201cYou lot go,\u201d Remus murmured, \u201cGet some rest. Thanks for coming, and all that...\u201d\n\u201cComing to Hogsmeade, Moony?\u201d Sirius asked, hauling James to his feet, \u201cThree Broomsticks?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Remus shook his head, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? Had my permission revoked. After the attacks\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Sirius looked outraged, \u201cThey can\u2019t punish YOU for something some other bastard\u2019s done!\u201d\n\u201cShhh!\u201d Remus flapped his hand, frowning. Madam Pomfrey could be on her way down the tunnel - and besides, he had a headache, \u201cIt\u2019s not to punish me, it\u2019s for my safety. Now get lost, the lot of you.\u201d\nThey were gone in just the nick of time, Madam Pomfrey entered the shack only minutes afterwards. She gave him a quick going over, and, satisfied, walked Remus back up to the castle. She prescribed him a few hours sleep in the hospital wing, which he was more than happy to accept. With all of his friends in Hogsmeade, there wasn\u2019t much to miss out on.\nHe woke at about lunch time, stomach rumbling as usual. Madam Pomfrey had evidently anticipated this; there was a plate of cold cuts and bread on his bedside table, along with a bowl of fruit and a large goblet of pumpkin juice, which he drained first.\nRemus was so ravenous, in fact, that he did not notice the letter propped up in the fruit bowl between two apples until he was well into the construction of his second sandwich. When he saw that it was addressed to him in a script familiar from the hundreds of returned Care of Magical Creatures essays, he almost knocked his plate off the bed in his eagerness to open it.\n\nDear Remus,\n\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasure to hear from you, I don\u2019t mind in the least.\n\n\nI cannot disclose my location at present, but rest assured that I am as safe as it is possible for me to be. I am glad to hear that you are well - Dumbledore told me about your OWL results. I\u2019m incredibly proud of you, Remus, I know you must have worked very hard. Keep on like that and I promise that nothing can stop you.\n\n\nIt is perfectly natural that you should want to know more about Greyback. I only wish I had more to tell you. I am afraid I have never worked on any werewolf-related cases for the ministry - and if you want my opinion, no one has done any useful research into lycanthropy since your father - and as you know, he was quite terribly wrong about a number of things.\n\n\nI do know that Greyback was a dangerous wizard before he was bitten, and is one of the cruellest men I have ever heard of - save Voldemort himself. The council that freed him against your father\u2019s wishes believed him to be a muggle tramp - I would take this to mean that he dresses shabbily, and is a skilled manipulator.\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t give you any more than this. I want to emphasise, however that the most important thing we know about Greyback is that\nhe is dangerous\n. If you have even the slightest suspicion that he knows where you are, then must contact Dumbledore immediately. Only Dumbledore can be trusted.\n\n\nBest of luck with your NEWTs.\n\n\nFerox.\n\nRemus read this through twice, then read the first paragraph once more, just for the thrill of it. \u2018\nI\u2019m incredibly proud of you, Remus\u2019\n. What a wonderful thing. There was no solid information in there, of course. Nothing Remus hadn\u2019t already considered - of course Greyback\nmust\nlook homeless; that was the best way to avoid drawing attention to yourself. And Remus was the very last person who needed to hear how dangerous this man was. The letter felt precious, all the same. Only the marauders had ever written to him before.\n\u201cGood afternoon dear,\u201d Madam Pomfrey emerged from behind the screen. She had a sixth sense for knowing when he was awake.\n\u201cHello,\u201d he smiled at her, Ferox\u2019s encouraging words still in his mind.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in a good mood,\u201d she smiled back, \u201cThough I don\u2019t blame you - nearly a perfect night! You\u2019re free to go as soon as you like.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d He swung his legs out of bed at once, then looked up, quickly, \u201cEr\u2026 Madam Pomfrey? Can I ask you something?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Remus,\u201d she replied, busying herself about stripping his bed now he had left it. She did it with a sweep of her wand, it was some of the most elegant and seamless magic Remus had ever seen.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to learn about healing spells. Just basic stuff - I\u2019m no good at Potions - actually, I dropped it.\u201d\n\u201cMm, I was sorry to hear that,\u201d she replied, tidying his bedside now, \u201cPotion making is a useful skill.\u201d\n\u201cRight, but I just want to be able to sort myself out after a full moon - once school finishes, you know\u2026\u201d\nMadam Pomfrey stopped what she was doing and sat on the bed to look at him. When he was a little boy, they were eye to eye when she sat down. Now she had to look up as he towered over her, and he thought for the first time what a very small woman she was. He had never forgotten the morning she had rocked him in her arms, and how safe she made him feel then. He could probably pick her up now, if he wanted to, and somehow she still gave him that same sense of security.\n\u201cAll right, Remus,\u201d she said, after surveying him, \u201cI teach a small selection of students the basics of healing on Tuesday evenings. You\u2019re welcome to join, if you wish, though there isn\u2019t a qualification in it.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you did that!\u201d\nShe smiled fondly, getting up again and resuming her work,\n\u201cIt\u2019s to prepare students wishing to begin their training as healers once they leave Hogwarts. I can only presume that healing was not your chosen career path when you spoke with Professor McGonagall last year,\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, right\u2026\u201d He rubbed the back of his head, slightly embarrassed. He had never thought about healing - largely because he though it probably involved a\nlot\nof potions, but also because he was quite certain that no one would want to hire a werewolf to look after vulnerable people.\nThe common room was nearly empty, it being a nice sunny autumnal day and a Hogsmeade weekend. Remus entered the dorm room quite noisily, allowing the door to slam. James sat up in bed, startled,\n\u201cBloody hell!\u201d\n\u201cOh, sorry!\u201d Remus cringed, \u201cI thought you\u2019d be in Hogsmeade!\u201d\n\u201cWe were going to,\u201d Sirius rolled over in his own bed, yawning, \u201cBut our beds looked so comfortable\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDamn, I didn\u2019t mean to sleep that long.\u201d James got up, stretching. \u201cI was going to slip Rosmerta a bit of cash for the Halloween firewhisky, too.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I got Peter to do it.\u201d Sirius replied, lying on his back, making no sign that he planned to get up at all. \u201cIs it lunch time?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus grinned, pleased to have his friends for an afternoon which he had expected to be very dull and lonely. \u201cShall we go down?\u201d\n\u201cLet me shower first,\u201d James nodded, trailing sleepily towards the bathroom. \u201cUgh, and I really ought to start that Defence Against the Dark Arts essay on patronuses - have either of you done it?\u201d\n\u201cDrafted,\u201d Remus said, flicking through his own pile of homework, \u201cYou can take a look if you want, but I bet you know it better than me anyway.\u201d\n\u201cHardly had time for the reading,\u201d James shouted from inside the bathroom. He never shut the door, and treated everywhere like a quidditch locker room, \u201cWith the game coming up and these prefect patrols - not that I\u2019m complaining about those\u2026 patronuses look really cool though, I wanted to be the first one to do it.\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t respond to this, but he thought James probably\nwould\nbe the first to cast a patronus. Not only because he was the best in the year at DADA, but - according to the books Remus had read so far, anyway \u2013 it looked like you needed to be able to conjure up a happy thought at extremely short notice. James seemed the most likely to be able to do this. Remus thought he could probably manage it too \u2013 but maybe not very quickly. He made a mental note to give it some further thought before the practical lesson.\n\u201cSo, we\u2019ve sorted the booze,\u201d Sirius was saying \u2013 loudly, so that James could hear them over the water running, \u201cFood is easy \u2013 and it\u2019ll be right after the feast, anyway, so no one\u2019ll be hungry except Moony.\u201d\n\u201cUp yours.\u201d Remus said, blithely, settling onto his own bed, still trying to come up with happy thoughts.\n\u201cDecorations\u2026\u201d Sirius continued, smiling, \u201cWell I\u2019ve asked Avni in Hufflepuff to do something creative with pumpkins, so we\u2019ll see how that goes\u2026 then all we need is music. You\u2019ll do that again, won\u2019t you, Moony?\u201d\nRemus shrugged,\n\u201cI could, but last time everyone just put on whatever they wanted anyway.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to admit that he wasn\u2019t particularly looking forward to the Halloween party. Not that he didn\u2019t love getting off his face on firewhisky and watching James make a prat of himself on the dancefloor. But he couldn\u2019t shake the memory of the last Gryffindor common room party, and how that had ended for him.\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Sirius was reassuring him, \u201cJust get them going for the first few tracks. Er\u2026 something they can dance to, this time?\u201d\nRemus smirked and raised an eyebrow,\n\u201cYou\ncan\ndance to Pink Floyd, if you try hard enough.\u201d\n\u201cI know you have standards, but er\u2026 Mary\u2019s asked if you could stick on some ABBA, maybe?\u201d Sirius asked this with a mild wince, as if it caused him physical pain.\n\u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d Remus flopped back on his bed, dramatically, throwing an arm over his face, \u201cSpare me.\u201d\nSirius laughed, which made even ABBA seem worth it.\n\u201cShit! Mary!\u201d James shouted from the bathroom.\nSirius frowned,\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He yelled back.\nJames came running out of the bathroom, soaking wet and dripping onto the floorboards, a towel around his waist.\n\u201c\nMary\n!\u201d He said, again, \u201cYou were supposed to treat her to a day out in Hogsmeade, to make up for her birthday!\u201d\n\u201cOh, buggering fuck.\u201d Sirius slapped his head, annoyed, \u201cHow do I keep\nforgetting\n?!\u201d\n\u201cNot your fault, mate,\u201d James said grabbing another towel to dry his hair, making it extra messy in the process. \u201cYou\u2019ve been busy.\u201d\nRemus thought this was extremely charitable of James, and actually a bit of a lie, really. Sirius was the least busy of the marauders \u2013 he hardly bothered with homework, he wasn\u2019t on the quidditch team, did nothing at all extracurricular, and was taking less subjects even than Peter. Other than detentions and a dedicated commitment to practical jokes, Mary was Sirius\u2019s only other real concern.\n\u201cAh, well, she\u2019ll forgive me.\u201d Sirius sighed, \u201cI\u2019ll take her out next time, and really go mad on Valentines day.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s months away,\u201d Remus reminded him.\nSirius shrugged. James shook his head, putting his glasses on and rooting around in his dresser for clothes,\n\u201cYour funeral, mate,\u201d he said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to lose that girl if you\u2019re not careful.\u201d\nRemus\u2019s heart skipped a beat."

What are you doing here?\u201d\nHe had reached the hospital wing now, and found Marlene waiting outside, smiling at him, clutching a large textbook to her chest.\n\u201cHiya,\u201d He smiled back, \u201cI\u2019m here for the healing lessons.\u201d\n\u201cOh wow! I had no idea you wanted to be a healer!\u201d She beamed.\n\u201cEr\u2026 well yeah, I mean I was just interested\u2026 how about you?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, it\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted to be!\u201d She said, proudly.\nRemus tried not to look too taken aback. That felt like the sort of thing he ought to know about his friends \u2013 but then, Marlene had always been a bit more private than Lily or Mary.\nSecretly, Remus had always felt a special fondness for Marlene. She was quiet and shy, like he was, less abrasive than Mary and less bossy than Lily. He remembered once, in a moment of confusion at the age of thirteen, having decided to fancy her. That embarrassed him now, but he had a feeling that if he told her, she\u2019d see the humour in it. Actually, now that he thought about it, Marlene had the inherent good nature and sensible attitude that probably suited a healer.\nBesides this, during Madam Pomfrey\u2019s lesson Marlene was clearly the stand out student. She seemed to know half the spells already, and the medi-witch approvingly told her she had a natural gift. Marlene flushed with pride at this, and Remus realised that it was the first time he\u2019d seen her so confident. She had always seemed to unsure of herself before.\n\u201cBlimey, I should just start taking lessons from you!\u201d He said, as they left the sick bay later that evening.\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d she grinned, bashfully, \u201cYou\u2019ll be running rings around me once you\u2019ve had the chance to catch up.\u201d\n\u201cDoubt it,\u201d he nudged her. \u201cDon\u2019t want to be a professional beater, then?\u201d\n\u201cHa, no chance!\u201d She laughed, \u201cYou should see the state my brother\u2019s in, and he\u2019s only been professional for a few years. Wouldn\u2019t mind being the healer for the Cannons, though. Or whatever team Potter gets drafted to \u2013 then I can still see you all after school finishes.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see each other anyway!\u201d Remus said, \u201cYou can\u2019t get rid of us that easily.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a sweetie, Remus,\u201d she elbowed him. \u201cHey, I\u2019m really looking forward to this party \u2013 are the rumours true?!\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026\u201d\n* * *\nHalloween 1976 was due to fall on a Sunday, and due to the nature of the evening, Hogwarts students were given Monday off. This, in Sirius\u2019s mind, could not have been more perfect.\nThe marauder\u2019s parties had grown legendary in status, and there were whispers all over the castle speculating on what exactly the four boys might have in store. There was mention of copious amounts of alcohol, potential fireworks \u2013 Remus heard one Hufflepuff who swore blind they had smuggled in a\nreal\nband, instruments and all.\n\u201cWhat do they think?\u201d Laughed James, \u201cI\u2019m hiding them under my bed? ...er\u2026 they might be right about the fireworks, though...\u201d\n\u201cJames!\u201d Remus groaned, \u201cYou\u2019re a\nprefect\n!\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d he grinned, puffing out his chest, \u201cAnd I have the authority to sanction any celebrations I see fit.\u201d\nRemus had tentatively prodded Lily on this statement \u2013 not wanting to get James into trouble, but equally not wanting to see her humiliated, either.\n\u201cLook, Remus, after six years I\u2019m learning to just go with the flow as far as you lot are concerned,\u201d she said, not looking up from her Arithmancy charts, \u201cIf Potter and Black want a party, they\u2019ll find a way \u2013 I\u2019m just going to brush up on extinguishing spells and make sure no one gets hurt. Besides,\u201d - \u00a0and she did look up, now - \u201cI think everyone needs a bit of cheering up. The war, you know\u2026\u201d\nSo that was that, then. If Lily Evans was ok with a party, Remus supposed that he would have to be as well. Besides, it was partly to celebrate Sirius\u2019s birthday, too, which fell on the following Wednesday. And you had to be capable of superhuman cruelty to deprive Sirius Black of a birthday celebration.\nThis was a sore spot with Mary, who had been forgotten about twice now and was rapidly losing patience with her flighty, easily distracted boyfriend. The problem was, she seemed to think that Remus was the best person to vent to about it.\n\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot,\u201d she sighed, a few days after forgiving Sirius for his latest slight (not after having charmed all of the goblets on the Gryffindor dining table to suddenly fling their contents into his face), \u201cI knew what he was like before we started going out, and my auntie always says \u2018you can\u2019t change a man\u2026\u2019\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d Remus replied, hoping this sounded caring and supportive. Evidently it did, because she carried right on talking,\n\u201cAnd, y\u2019know I\nlike\nthe fact that he doesn\u2019t follow the rules, and he doesn\u2019t care what anyone thinks. I do just sort of wish he cared what\nI\nthink\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he does.\u201d Remus mumbled.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t show it, though\u2026 and, actually, he\u2019s not the\nonly\ngood-looking boy at Hogwarts.\u201d She said this with a wry look on her face, as a tall Ravenclaw seventh year walked past them. Roman Rotherhide \u2013 Remus had heard a lot of girls whispering about him. He had curly fair hair as long as Sirius\u2019s, and dark brown eyes.\nMary licked her lips, her own eyes following the older boy as he left the library. Remus slammed his book shut,\n\u201cShall we go?\u201d\n* * *\nSunday 31st October 1976\nThe afternoon of the party, Remus was lying on his bed with the curtains drawn, listening to\nDiamond Dogs\nfor the hundredth time, trying to avoid all of the nonsense going on downstairs. The girls seemed to have joined forces and turned the usually comfortable, slightly worn around the edges Gryffindor common room into a cross between a jumble sale and the Boots cosmetics counter. He could practically smell the perfume from his bed, and it made his nose itch.\nThey were \u2018getting ready\u2019, Mary and Marlene had told him, though Remus couldn\u2019t see what that meant, exactly \u2013 except that it seemed to involve a lot of mirrors, a lot of giggling, and an ungodly amount of hairspray.\nJames was trying out new beaters for the quidditch team, and Remus assumed Sirius was with him. Peter was helping Dezzie \u2018choose a dress\u2019 for the party (though Remus suspected this was just a cover story; a glance at the marauders map told him that Peter Pettigrew and Desdemona Lewis were alone in the prefect\u2019s bathroom.)\nAlone and exiled from the common room, Remus had considered the library \u2013 but Christopher was there, and it looked like he was sitting close to the entrance (a novice error \u2013 you got far better light near the back by the windows), which meant that Remus would have to say hello, and Christopher would make some cold, shrugging reply, and eventually Remus was going to have to sort all of that out, but just now he\nwasn\u2019t in the bloody mood, ok?!\nFeeling very sorry for himself, he reclined on the bed and raised his wand, lazily levitating the record out of its sleeve and onto the needle. He\u2019d lugged the record player up from its usual spot on Sirius\u2019s shelf and sat it on the end of his bed, hoping that with the bedcurtains drawn he could play it loud enough to drown out the high-pitched chatter drifting up the stairs.\n\n\u2018In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch\n\n\nSashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch\n\n\nJust another future song for lonely little kids\u2026\u2019\n\n\u201cOh, hello.\u201d Sirius poked his head through the curtains. Remus sat up.\n\u201cHi,\u201d he replied, uneasily, slightly embarrassed, as if he\u2019d been caught doing something he shouldn\u2019t be, \u201cDid you want your record player back?\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d Sirius waved a hand. He opened the curtains further, and much to Remus\u2019s horror, climbed inside, crawling onto the bed. He settled down on his back beside Remus and listened to the record with him.\nThey were quiet for a long while, both staring at the red canopy above them. Remus kept telling himself that Sirius was behaving perfectly normally. He lounged about on James\u2019s bed all the time; it meant nothing.\nFinally, much to his relief, Sirius spoke.\n\u201cBroke up with Mary.\u201d\nAh. So that was all. Remus raised his eyebrows,\n\u201cReally? Sorry about that, mate.\u201d\nHe felt Sirius shrug beside him,\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s ok. Not like I was in love with her or anything.\u201d\n\u201cPlenty more fish in the sea.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius chuckled. They both fell quiet again. Bowie\u2019s thin, sharp voice rattled between them. The first song ended and the thunderous swell of\nSweet Thing\nbegan. \u201cLove this track.\u201d Sirius commented. Remus murmured in agreement.\n\n\u2018If you want it, boys, get it here thing,\n\n\nCuz hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing\u2019\n\n\u201cWe did it.\u201d Sirius said, suddenly. \u201cMe and Mary.\u201d\n\u201cYou did\u2026\noh\n. When?\u201d\n\u201cOver the summer. Once or twice since we\u2019ve been back at Hogwarts.\n\u201cRight. Is that\u2026 I mean, that\u2019s not why she dumped you?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Sirius scowled at him, \u201cThanks for the vote of confidence, but I don\u2019t think I was\nthat\nterrible. We just broke up, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026How was it?\u201d\n\u201cThe break up?\u201d\n\u201cNo! \u2026How was\u2026\nIt?\n!\u201d\nSirius smiled enigmatically,\n\u201cOh yeah\u2026 it was good. Great. Not like I imagined, but\u2026 yeah, good.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026 good, then.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s really gorgeous. Mary.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, she is.\u201d\n\u2018Then let it be; it's all I ever wanted\nIt's a street with a deal, and a taste\nIt's got claws, it's got me, it's got you\u2026\u2019\n\u201cRemember when we were kids, and we were convinced Bowie was a wizard?\u201d Sirius said.\nRemus smiled fondly at the memory,\n\u201cYeah, I think I still sort of believe he is.\u201d\n\u201cOne day, when we all live in London, we\u2019ll go and find him, and then we can ask.\u201d\nRemus burst out laughing.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Sirius grinned back at him.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just\nmeet\nsomeone like Bowie!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t see why not. We could go to one of his gigs, or find out where he lives. Have some imagination, Lupin \u2013 once we\u2019re of age we can do\nanything.\n\u201d\nRebel Rebel\nstarted up next. It was practically Sirius\u2019 theme song by now.\n\u201cAnything.\u201d Remus smirked. \u201cYou\nalready\nthink you can do anything.\u201d\n\u201cCalling me arrogant?\u201d Sirius narrowed his eyes, sitting up. He was smiling. Remus smiled back,\n\u201cGoing to deny it?\u201d He replied, \u201cYour ego is so big it has its own orbit.\u201d\n\u201cHarsh!\u201d\n\u201cYour ego is so big,\u201d Remus continued, slyly, \u201cWhen you were doing it with Mary you probably closed your eyes and imagined yourself!\u201d\n\u201cYou wound me, Lupin!\u201d Sirius reached for a pillow and began to beat him with it. Remus kneed him in the shin, rolling over to try and stop Sirius\u2019 onslaught, but Sirius was quicker. Laughing, he clambered on top of Remus, forcing him down, holding his wrists over his head. \u201cHa!\u201d He cheered, triumphant. \u201cApologise!\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus cocked an eyebrow, and struggled to get free. Sirius was straddling him now, and braced himself against Remus\u2019 movements, pushing back down.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t escape!\u201d Sirius said, \u201cI\u2019ve got you, Moony!\u201d\nTheir eyes met and everything was different. Remus became acutely aware of the lack of space between them, every shape and angle of Sirius\u2019 body that was touching his own. He jerked upwards, deliberately, testing, and Sirius pushed back.\n\u201cSirius,\u201d Remus whispered, tentatively, hearing the catch in his own voice. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d\n\u201cSh,\u201d Sirius shook his head. \u201cShh,\u201d Sirius said again, leaning forward now, letting go of Remus\u2019 wrists, \u201cJust this\u2026 just\u2026\u201d His face was buried in the pillow next to them, Remus could hear his breathing quickening over the opening refrain of\nRock \u2018n\u2019 Roll with Me.\n\n\u2018You always were the one that knew\u2026\u2019\n\n\u201cOk,\u201d Remus whispered.\nWe\u2019ll do this.\nIf this was what Sirius wanted, Remus wasn\u2019t going to ask any more questions \u2013 he didn\u2019t think he had enough blood left in his brain to formulate a thought, anyway; he was aching, straining with desire, and Sirius was pressing down on him, hitting the very parts of Remus that cared most for pressure. He pushed his hand between them, fumbled with the buttons on their jeans. Sirius stiffened slightly, but allowed it, letting Remus do everything. Letting Remus\ntouch\nhim.\nHe was momentarily shy about his body \u2013 how bony his body must seem; how awkward his hands. But soon there was no space left for shyness, Sirius kept moving, and Remus was lost, completely lost in the strange familiarity of another person, and the gorgeous smell of Sirius\u2019s hair.\nIt was over almost as quickly as it had begun. All it took was the right angle against Sirius's hip and Remus gasped, twitching, seeing stars, and a second later Sirius let out a muffled cry into the bedsheets.\nIn the quiet moments that followed, they lay breathless and tense. Then Sirius propped himself back up, and climbed off, rolling over onto his back. They said nothing as they did up their trousers and straightened their clothes. Remus refused to be the first to speak.\n\u201cGot a bit carried away.\u201d Sirius said, clearing his throat.\nRemus blinked.\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d He swallowed, dryly.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No, it\u2019s ok.\u201d\nSirius looked awkward \u2013 Remus had never seen him look so out of his depth before.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have a shower. Not long until the feast.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Remus nodded again, watching Sirius carefully climb out of the bed and back through the curtains. He stopped and turned back quickly, looking slightly panicked,\n\u201cYou won\u2019t tell anyone?\u201d\nRemus snorted and shook his head.\n\u201c\u2019s\u2019if I would.\u201d\nSirius nodded, and closed the curtain behind him.\nRemus flopped back on the bed, his mind still catching up. If he wasn\u2019t so confused, he\u2019d be furious."

The food was delicious, as usual \u2013 a glorious golden hog roast with apple crumble covered in goopy yellow custard for pudding. It was just terrible for Remus. Sirius wasn\u2019t rude, or cold \u2013 he wasn\u2019t even trying to avoid Remus. It was exactly his dreadful dedication to normality that made it so awful. He smiled. He laughed. He joked. He called Remus \u2018\nMoony\u2019\nwithout a trace of shame. Remus had no choice but to follow his lead \u2013 after all, he\u2019d promised not to tell.\nMind you, he hadn\u2019t the first clue how you\nwould\ntell somebody a thing like that.\n\n\u201cOi, James, has Sirius ever sort of got into bed with you and then you sort of ended up touching quite a bit?\u201d\n\nOh god, what if he\nhad\n?! There was also Lily, of course, the most sympathetic person Remus knew after James \u2013 though the thought of talking to a\ngirl\nabout that sort of thing was mortifying. Mary was the most sexually experienced person Remus knew \u2013 and he absolutely, one hundred percent, could\nnot\ntalk to her about Sirius.\nNot that she\u2019d have been upset. As the party got into full swing (Remus knocked back three shots of whisky as soon as the opportunity presented), Mary descended from the girls\u2019 dorm dressed to kill in a very tight red dress, which made even Remus stare for a few seconds. Roman Rotherhide of Ravenclaw was first to offer her a drink, and the two spent the rest of the evening entirely absorbed in each other, in one way or another.\nRemus skulked by the record player for a bit, deliberately putting on the most abrasive, least danceable records he could find. The Stooges\u2019\nWe Will Fall,\nswiftly followed by\nSister Ray\n, then some Captain Beefheart for good measure. \u00a0Eventually he was overpowered by a group of fourth year girls, who ganged up on him clutching David Cassidy and Bay City Rollers LPs. After that, he devoted himself to the punch bowl.\nSirius was having a good time, obviously. He and James were gregarious hosts, as always, making the rounds like the good pureblood heirs they were. The common room kept filling up as students came from all over the castle, and it got so warm that Remus ended up taking a bottle of Witches Brew he\u2019d topped up with whisky, and sitting alone by the open window chain smoking.\nMarlene approached at some point, to see if he was ok, and to ask if Sirius was seeing anyone else, now that he and Mary were over. Remus scowled at the hopeful look in her eyes and told her he didn\u2019t give a shit. She frowned, but left him alone after that.\nAt about nine o'clock, things got\nreally\nhazy. The last thing he remembered was Peter and Desdemona\u2019s pitch perfect performance of\nParadise by the Dashboard\n\nLight\n(trust Peter to like Meatloaf, out of all the muggle music in the world). Remus vaguely remembered smiling stupidly as the pair of them flung each other about the room, red and sweating but having the time of their lives, belting out the duet at the top of their lungs.\n\nYou gotta do what you can\n\n\nAnd let mother nature do the rest\n\n\nAin't no doubt about it\n\n\nWe were doubly blessed\n\n\n'Cause we were barely seventeen\n\n\nAnd we were barely dressed...\n\nThe next thing Remus knew, he was in the dorm bathroom, bent over the toilet bowl, choking his guts out. He must have got there a bit late, because his shirt and trousers were wet and stinking. The room whirled and lurched, and he lay down on the soothing cold tiles, as the closing bars of\nRebel Rebel\nwafted up the stairs.\n\u201cOi, Moony! Wakey wakey, mate,\u201d James\u2019s voice boomed into his throbbing head a few hours later.\n\u201cGnuuughh.\u201d\n\u201cBloody hell,\u201d James sighed, \u201c\nScourgify\n! C\u2019mon, up you get, it\u2019s Padfoot\u2019s turn to puke\u2026\u201d\nRemus blinked at the bright light, and tried to crawl to his feet. Their bathroom was small to begin with, just room for a sink, toilet and bathtub. There wasn\u2019t\nreally\nroom for three lanky sixteen-year-old boys, two of whom were so drunk they could barely stand. Remus backed into the sink as Sirius flung himself at the toilet bowl, noisily throwing up. Luckily his hair was tied back.\nRemus blinked again, staring dopily at him for a while, before James gently yanked him up by the elbow,\n\u201cC\u2019mon Moony, me old pal, time for bed, eh?\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d He mumbled, feeling childish and helpless. He allowed James to lead him out of the bathroom and towards his bed.\nUgh\n. The sheets were still rumpled, and Sirius\u2019s record player was still perched precariously at the foot. James moved this as Remus clambered under the covers, still in his jeans and socks.\n\u201cPfft, you were supposed to be the responsible one,\u201d James huffed, jokily, as he drew the bed curtains. \u201cNight night, Moony.\u201d\n\u201cJaaaaames\u2026\u201d Sirius whined from the bathroom. James tutted, and Remus closed his eyes.\nThe hangover the next day was so horrendous Remus thought he\u2019d probably never drink again.\n* * *\nWednesday 10th November 1976\nIn the week that followed, Remus was completely on edge whenever Sirius was around. They weren\u2019t ever alone together \u2013 and it was hard to tell whether or not this had been engineered by Sirius, or whether it was just a consequence of being at boarding school. Certainly, Remus made no effort to catch him alone \u2013 who knew what might happen?!\nThere were plenty of explanations, of this he was certain. He just had to think about it. Perhaps Sirius was just\nup\nfor it \u2013 they were both teenage boys, after all. Remus had been readily available, and hadn\u2019t put up any resistance. Perhaps this was the sort of thing rich boys\ndid\nat boarding school. Find a bit of rough to rub up against. It could even be a bit of Sirius\u2019 canine side coming out.\nThe worst part was that Remus didn\u2019t actually\ncare\nwhat the reason had been. He just wanted it to happen again. As guilty as he knew he ought to feel, he spent every night lying in his bed and wishing, wishing that Sirius would come creeping over. Or that he, Remus, had the courage to get up and go to Sirius himself. But the courage never came, and after a week (which comprised Sirius\u2019s birthday, a Hogsmeade weekend, Bonfire Night\nand\na full moon) Remus simply had to try and give up on it.\nAs usual when facing a crisis, Remus had composed a trusty list to help even out his thinking. This one was titled:\nReasons to forget the Sirius situation.\n\nSirius clearly wanted to pretend it had never happened. A good friend ought to respect his wishes.\n\nRemus wanted to be a good friend, because, after all, losing a friend was potentially much worse than never touching Sirius again. Wasn\u2019t it?\n\nSirius was making no bones about his deep and abiding attraction to girls. All girls. Every girl.\n\nThis last point was the most salient. A contributing factor to Remus\u2019s messy downfall at the Halloween party had been Sirius\u2019s dogged attempts to flirt with every girl in the room over fifteen. Extremely successful attempts. By the time the next weekend rolled around, it was common knowledge that Sirius was now casually seeing Avni Chaudry, the Hufflepuff who had enchanted the pumpkins to glow in the dark.\nThis was a familiar situation, by now, and Remus was at least glad that he wasn\u2019t a prefect anymore, and ran no risk of stumbling upon Sirius and Avni snogging in the Astronomy tower. He did start avoiding the greenhouses, though.\nLife plodded on. Remus\u2019s study group slowly re-banded, sidling up to him one by one in the common room, or the library, to politely enquire whether the seat next to him was taken, and then \u2013 once he had confirmed its availability \u2013 settling in and asking if he would mind just checking something for them, or giving his opinion on some point or other. Remus didn\u2019t mind. It was a good distraction, and much healthier than getting stoned, at least. Christopher did not join in, but Remus supposed he might just be busy with his OWLs.\nThe third full moon of the year went just as well as the previous two \u2013 James swore he\u2019d caught sight of a unicorn, really really, this time. And the lessons with Madam Pomfrey became an unexpected delight, to the point where Remus was now competent at healing minor abrasions and bruises. No more TCP for him.\nSo really, he told himself repeatedly, he, Remus John Lupin, had no reason at all to be unhappy. Everything was\nas it should be\n- even James and Lily were getting along without any hexes or curses being thrown. The emptiness was only inside him \u2013 his outer life was fuller than ever.\nIn light of all of this, he was quite surprised to receive a letter one quiet afternoon in the library. Actually, \u2018received a letter\u2019 might be overstating it. A paper aeroplane stabbed him in the back of his head, while he was trying to concentrate on converting an Agrippan arithmetic equation into the Chaldean form. He hissed in pain and grabbed it, glaring around. He was alone, but he knew exactly who was to blame. James\u2019s locomotor charms were legendary. He unfolded it, smoothed it out and began to read.\n\nMarauders assemble! We have lain dormant too long.\n\n\nTonight. Midnight. Garden tapestry. Mischief.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t help but smile. They hadn\u2019t done a proper prank in ages.\n* * *\nThursday 11th November 1976 (Midnight)\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\n\u201cOh, hiya Moony, you found the cloak then. Sirius with you?\u201d\n\u201cI thought he was with you!\u201d\n\u201cNah, I had patrol.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Wormtail?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s here, on my shoulder. We didn\u2019t fit otherwise.\u201d\n\u201cYou two are making so much noise.\u201d\n\u201cPadfoot!\u201d\n\u201cProngs.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you get here without the cloak?\u201d\n\u201cI walked, you wuss.\u201d\n\u201cLucky Filch didn\u2019t see you.\u201d\n\u201cI was born lucky.\u201d\nThe \u2018garden tapestry\u2019 was on the ground floor, only a few yards away from the entrance to the dungeons. From this, Remus had surmised that the prank would be aimed at Slytherin. He was not wrong. James had a very large wooden box with him, which he was propelling along with his patented locomotion charm.\n\u201cSome of the bubotubers accidentally cross-bred with some puffball mushrooms,\u201d he whispered, as they crept down the stairs to the dungeons. \u201cProfessor Sprout asked me to chuck them on the compost heap, but I thought that would be a waste\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhere are we going to put them?\u201d Sirius whispered back, excitedly.\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t know this year\u2019s Slytherin password \u2013 any of you?\u201d\nThey all shook their heads, except for Peter, who \u2013 still perched on James\u2019s shoulder \u2013 gave a negative sounding squeak. James sighed, only mildly disappointed, \u201cThen I thought we could probably just leave them scattered about a bit \u2013 they\u2019re just about ready to spore, I reckon\u2026\u201d\nOnce they had reached the dingy, cave-like lower levels of the castle, Peter transformed back into himself, and James set down his crate. He lifted the lid to present a bounty of at least one hundred large, yellowish, gently pulsating mushrooms.\n\u201cEugh.\u201d Peter said.\n\u201cYup,\u201d James grinned, lifting one carefully out of the box. It was about the size of a tennis ball, \u201cDon\u2019t squeeze \u2018em, they\u2019re full of pus and ready to blow.\u201d\n\u201cThis is going to be\nexcellent\n.\u201d Sirius grinned, reaching in and grabbing two.\nThey quickly and efficiently began squirrelling away the weird, pimpleish fungus \u2013 behind sconces, over doorways, under carpets and inside suits of armour. The puffball-bubotuber hybrids were throbbing unpleasantly in their hands, and Remus thought James was right; they were ready to go off at any minute, leaving the dungeons covered in foul-smelling yellow pus.\nThey had maybe half finished with the box, when Remus\u2019s ears pricked \u2013 he had the strange sense he was being watched. Whirling around, he spotted the glowing yellow eyes of Mrs Norris, peering around the corner with that smug, spiteful look on her squashed face.\n\u201cShit,\u201d he whispered, \u201cQuick, look!\u201d\n\u201cOh bugger!\u201d James said, \u201cYou three take the cloak and hide, I\u2019ll--\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Filch\u2019s voice barked.\n\u201cQuick!\u201d James hissed, and began running in the opposite direction.\nPeter, Sirius and Remus looked at each other, before telepathically deciding to duck into the nearest open doorway \u2013 which just so happened to be the girl\u2019s loos.\n\u201cThat fucking cat has it in for me,\u201d Sirius muttered, \u201cEver since I became an Animagus.\u201d\n\u201cYou can talk!\u201d Peter replied testily, wringing his hands. Remus had dragged the box of mushrooms in behind them, and was desperately looking for a place to hide it.\n\u201cPush it in front of the door!\u201d Sirius said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that will--\u201d\n\u201c\nLocomoto\n!\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d\nSirius was not as good at this charm as James. He always put a bit too much force behind it. It was all Remus could do to duck down and cover his head, as the crate of delicate bubotuber-puffballs slammed loudly into the bathroom door, setting off every last pustule with a sickening squelch.\nPeter disappeared completely, shrinking down to rat-size at the very last moment, and scuttling down the nearest drain for refuge. Sirius, ever-confident in his abilities, simply stood there looking stupid as gallons and gallons of pus exploded in his face, coating the entire bathroom in the process.\nIt was sometimes very easy not to idolise Sirius Black."

Peter\u2019s quick thinking had got him out of it, and James had run fast enough in time. He wanted to tell McGonagall that the whole thing had been his idea, but Sirius wouldn\u2019t let him.\nTheir head of house gave them one of the worst dressing downs they\u2019d had in years \u2013 made all the worse by the fact that she was clad in her tartan nightie and dressing down, which was not amusing in the slightest, but extremely terrifying. They stood in her office, heads hung, dripping pus until she dismissed them to bed. Twenty house points lost, and detention until Christmas. Ah well.\n\u201cYou both have an hour free before lunch tomorrow,\u201d she said, as a parting barb, \u201cI expect both of you to report to the dungeons in order to clean up your mess.\nWithout magic\n.\u201d\nSirius was furious, and after he\u2019d washed went to bed without another word. Pete sat on the end of his own bed, looking pale faced and worried.\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry!\u201d He whispered to Remus, desperately, \u201cI panicked, sometimes I just lose control when I\u2019m scared\u2026\u201d\n\u201cS\u2019ok,\u201d Remus replied, tiredly, \u201cIt\u2019s only detention.\u201d\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d James piped up from his bed, \u201cThey didn\u2019t find any of the puffballs we hid, yet\u2026\u201d\nJames was quite right, and in a sublime twist of fate, the bubotuber-puffballs exploded early the next morning, just as most of the Slytherin students were on their way from the dungeons to the Great Hall for breakfast. So at least the evening had not been a complete waste of time.\n\u201cIt was you two?!\u201d Lily stared at Remus, amazed, when he told her why he couldn\u2019t meet her in the library before lunch, \u201cNot Black and Potter, Black and\nyou\n?!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t have to act that surprised,\u201d he frowned, \u201cI\u2019m capable of being an idiot as much as anyone else is.\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I thought you and Sirius were on the outs.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would you think that?!\u201d\n\u201cOh, something Mary said, I suppose\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat did Mary say?\u201d Remus felt a flare of heat shoot up his neck \u2013 had Sirius told Mary something? Some stupid slip of the tongue while they were cosying up together?\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Lily looked mildly surprised, \u201cAsk her, I can\u2019t really remember, I just thought she said something about the two of you not talking. Anyway, if you could please try not to destroy any more bathrooms this year? Gryffindor\u2019s got the lowest house points already, and it\u2019s not even Christmas.\u201d\nThe surprise corridor attacks had lost twenty more house points from Gryffindor, and an extra night\u2019s detention for Remus and Sirius. James was terribly guilty, but Sirius\u2019s sense of chivalry and honour got in the way, and he still wouldn\u2019t let him confess.\nOf course, it was a very different story later that day, when he and Remus were standing outside the cordoned off bathroom, waiting for Filch to arrive with buckets and mops.\n\u201cBloody Wormtail, this is all his fault.\u201d\n\u201cNo it isn\u2019t.\u201d Remus yawned, leaning against the wall. He hadn\u2019t had enough sleep.\n\u201cThe little twerp ran away like the vermin he is!\u201d\n\u201cHey, be nice,\u201d Remus frowned, \u201cHe only did that because\nsomeone\ngot over excited and blew up all those mushrooms.\u201d\n\u201cI was thinking on my feet.\u201d Sirius raised his chin, defiantly.\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t thinking at all.\u201d\n\u201cWell\nyou\nweren\u2019t doing anything!\u201d\n\u201cI was trying to hide it! If we\u2019d hidden the box and got under the cloak, no one would have got in trouble at all!\u201d\n\u201cWell you didn\u2019t say that at the time!\u201d Sirius snapped.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t give me a chance!\u201d\n\u201cHe still didn\u2019t have to run away.\u201d Sirius folded his arms, leaning against the opposite wall.\nTired and grumpy, Remus spat back,\n\u201cJames ran away too. Don't see you cursing\nhis\nname.\u201d\nSirius glared at him, furiously. How dare anyone speak against James Potter in the presence of Sirius Black. Remus rolled his eyes and stared at the ceiling until Filch arrived.\nArgus Filch was one of the most unpleasant adults Remus had ever met. Matron would have liked him. A bitter, spiteful, creeping man on the wrong side of middle age, Filch was a caretaker and a sneak, who seemed to hate students more than anyone who worked in a school really ought to. This was never more evident than when he was permitted to administer detentions.\nHe dropped two large wooden buckets at their feet with a malicious grin on his face, and pushed the door open. Overnight, the pus seemed to have dried and left a thick yellowish crust over most of the surfaces it had hit. Remus wrinkled his nose. Filch handed them both mops and scrubbing brushes.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back to check on you on two hours.\u201d He said, \u201cYou ought to be done by then. No wands and no funny business.\u201d He sneered as he left them to it.\nRemus looked at Sirius, who was obviously still annoyed with him. He straightened his back,\n\u201cI\u2019ll start over there,\u201d he nodded to the far end of the bathroom, \u201cYou go over there.\u201d He indicated the opposite end.\n\u201cFine.\u201d Remus shrugged, lifting his bucket and filling it at the sink. Yes, actually, that was perfect. They\u2019d keep to their own sides and just get this stupid thing over with.\nSirius still wasn\u2019t talking to him, and turned his back, working in silence. Remus followed suit. Two could play at that game. Sirius was making it much easier.\nRemus would never admit it, but he didn\u2019t mind cleaning, and actually found it quite satisfying. As disgusting as the pus looked, it came away from the white tile easily with a bit of soap and water, so the work wasn\u2019t too physically taxing, until it came to wiping down the walls. This was harder just because of all the reaching and stretching, which tired him out and made his shoulders ache.\nAdditionally, bubotuber pus wasn\u2019t\nactually\npus, according to the Herbology textbook Remus had skimmed in a hurry before turning up to clean it \u2013 in that it wasn\u2019t dirty or toxic. In fact, it had several healing properties \u2013 and while this gunk was from an accidental cross-bred strain, it probably couldn\u2019t do any more harm than pumpkin juice.\nThe little bathroom was eerily quiet, with the two boys silently working and only the occasional sloshing sound of them filling up their buckets or swabbing the floor. Remus didn\u2019t mind the cold atmosphere, either \u2013 it actually helped him concentrate. He had known for a long time that his feelings for Sirius rarely got in the way of his ability to be irritated by Sirius.\nBy the time the first hour was up, they had managed to remove all trace of the mess, and all that was left to do was a final rinse down. Remus rinsed his bucket a few more times, and took the opportunity to wash his hands and his face, which had grown hot from exertion. Sirius joined him at the sink, but they didn\u2019t speak.\n\u201cNearly finished,\u201d Remus tried, tentatively.\nSirius snorted, annoyed,\n\u201cNo thanks to Wormt-\u201d\n\u201cShut up about Wormtail, will you?!\u201d Remus said, exasperated, \u201cGrow up!\u201d\nSirius frowned, and said nothing. He washed his hands and face too. Remus tried not to watch. He turned back to his own wall, and began squeezing clear water across it, wiping away what was left of the soap suds.\nA shadow appeared at his shoulder, and he braced himself for more bickering.\n\u201cYou missed a bit.\u201d Sirius huffed, grumpily, elbowing Remus out of the way and scrubbing it himself. Affronted, Remus scowled back at him,\n\u201cThought we were sticking to our\nown\nsides.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, thought you could be trusted to do a decent job.\u201d\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have you breathing down my neck the whole time!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so sensitive,\u201d Sirius snapped.\n\u201cNah, you\u2019re just acting like a prick.\u201d Remus elbowed him, harder than he really meant to.\nSirius shoved him against the wall, and Remus slipped, grabbing Sirius to steady himself. Furious, he pushed him back. \u201cWanker.\u201d He said.\nSirius kissed him.\nSirius kissed like nobody else; languid, firm and unhurried. Remus responded instantly, hands fisting the material of Sirius\u2019s shirt, wanting to run his fingers through the other boy\u2019s hair. But Sirius broke away before he could, stepping back, looking horrified with himself. His lips were pink and shining, slightly parted. Remus had to look away.\n\u201cRemus I\u2019m\u2026 shit, I\u2019m sorry. I dunno what keeps happening to me.\u201d\n\u201cS\u2019ok.\u201d Remus said, not meeting his eyes.\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m\nnot a--\n\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus said, \u201cYeah, course. Me neither.\u201d He said it quickly and without thinking. He said it to stop Sirius saying that word.\nThey were quiet for a bit more. Remus\u2019s heart was racing, he could hardly think straight. He reached out, catching the thin white fabric of Sirius\u2019s shirt between his fingers and tugging it slightly, finally meeting Sirius\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cNo one\u2019s gonna find out,\u201d Remus said, quietly, echoing something he had been told once.\nSirius gazed back at him, his eyes burning.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t say anything?\u201d\nRemus shook his head as Sirius came a little closer. Remus continued, braver now,\n\u201cI won\u2019t. We\u2026 we don\u2019t have to stop. Unless you want to\u2014\u201d\nSirius kissed him, full on the mouth again. They both knew they had crossed a line, but it couldn\u2019t be helped now, and it was so, so good, and their bodies were hard against each other, hands fumbling with belt buckles, as if they\u2019d known this was the plan all along.\nOnce it was over, they clung to each other for long, exhausted seconds. Then Sirius withdrew carefully, stepping back. Remus longed to pull him close again, to never stop. He touched Sirius\u2019s hair one last time, pretending to push it back into place. They stared into each other\u2019s eyes, bold and unashamed for a few short seconds.\n\u201cYou\u2019re lovely.\u201d Sirius said, so softly.\nRemus could only smile back gently, he didn\u2019t know what to say. The room had grown cold. \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Sirius started buttoning his trousers, looking away, finally, \u201cWe\u2019d better finish this cleaning.\u201d\nRemus nodded, still mute, unable to do much more than lean back against the wall as he watched Sirius wash his hands again, and pick up his mop. The sight of him walking away was too familiar, and Remus burst out,\n\u201cYou\u2019re not--don\u2019t run off, this time.\u201d\nSirius looked back, a bit surprised, and a bit something else.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, Moony.\u201d He spoke gently.\n\u201cOh, ok. Good, then.\u201d\n\u201cI felt bad about that. Last time. Sorry.\u201d He was on the other side of the room now, and maybe that made it easier to talk. \u201cBut I thought you\u2019d be angry or something. I dunno.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re still friends, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u201cOf course! We\u2019ll always be friends, Padfoot.\u201d\nRemus was making a promise, though his brain was too foggy to really recognise it at the time.\nSirius had acknowledged, however shyly, that whatever kept happening was probably going to happen again. He had assumed the role he always did \u2013 impulsive, expectant and irresponsible. For his part, Remus took up his own mantle \u2013 the one who\nwould\nbe responsible. He would keep the secrets; he would accept what he was given; he would be responsible.\nIf those are the things he needs,\nRemus decided,\nthen those are the things I can give him.\nIt was nothing at all.\nBrave\n, Sirius had called him once, in another bathroom, not so long ago. Remus hadn\u2019t known then whether or not he was, really, but he had liked the sound of it at the time, and he liked it even more now. Now, with the taste of Sirius still on his lips, and the echoes of pleasure still settling in his body.\nAs he watched Sirius finish sluicing down the far wall, encouraging the water down the drain with his mop, and glancing up to smile, now and then, Remus realised that what he had been waiting for all this time was for\nSirius\nto be brave. What occurred to him, now, with the clarity of a lightning bolt, was that he, Remus, could be brave for both of them."

He never initiated it; he didn\u2019t need to. Sirius came to him. Remus would find himself pulled into an empty classroom, or their shared bathroom - once or twice Sirius even crept quietly into Remus\u2019s bed, casting a silencing spell before forcing his shoulders down and running his hands over Remus\u2019s body, quaking with desire. Never under the covers though - that would be queer. He would scurry out as soon as it was over.\nIt almost always happened in a hurry. Remus knew that this was partly the shame of it. But he also knew that it was because they both just\nneeded\nit so badly \u2013 when they were together their bodies buzzed with the want for each other.\nNo two times were the same. Sometimes they could be confident and bold, other times they were shy, and one needed encouragement from the other. Sometimes it wasn\u2019t even about getting off, and they were limited to just kissing \u2013 or at least, Sirius\u2019s idea of kissing, which was brutal, fierce, and thankless. Remus\u2019s lips felt scorched, burned raw, for days and days.\nAfterwards they didn\u2019t talk about it, but - if time permitted - sat apart from each other and invariably shared a cigarette, silent until they were ready to fall slowly back into their usual jokey banter. Remus felt at those times that Sirius probably would have preferred to be with someone else. A girlfriend or \u2013 even worse \u2013 James.\nI\u2019m not the one he wants,\nRemus told himself, pitifully,\nI\u2019m just the one that\u2019s here.\nThe worst part was that he knew that it was enough. If Sirius only ever came to him in darkness and silence, then so be it. It was better than going without.\nThat someone like me gets to have someone like him.\nHe had to share, of course. Whether it was Sirius\u2019s desire to hide what was going on, or he was simply unable to stay committed to one person, after Avni there were others. A parade of pretty, bright, cheerful girls; Florence and Daisy and Tessa and Eunice. Remus didn\u2019t think any of these trysts were serious, and in the beginning at least, he didn\u2019t begrudge Sirius his fun.\nI never asked for anything more,\nhe told himself.\nAnd Remus liked it being private. He had never been someone who liked attention, and he thought that even if it was a given that whatever he and Sirius were doing was no different to what Sirius did with any of the\ngirls\nhe got attached to, then Remus would probably still prefer that James and Peter did not know. Maybe he could have told them about Grant, one day, eventually - but not Sirius. It was too complicated.\nHe\nliked\nknowing that he and Sirius could be in a room full of people, and no one had a clue what they had been doing only the night before, or even two hours earlier. He liked getting away with it. He liked seeing Sirius with a girl, and thinking\nnever mind, later he belongs to me.\nHe was allowed to be happy, after all. He was allowed to have\nsomething\nall for himself - especially as, in other areas in Remus\u2019s life, doors were closing, and things were being taken away.\nThere was another werewolf attack during the December moon, which fell early in the month that year. Witnesses described more than one creature - they were working as a pack. The ministry was placed on high alert, and the whole school was talking about it. The marauders didn\u2019t bring it up around Remus - not even Sirius. He couldn\u2019t blame them; he\u2019d have bitten their head off if anyone had tried to sympathise, or be kind about it.\nStill, he had to put up with everyone else; every other student in the school who had taken to wearing silver jewellery, or talking about the best way to fend off a wolf attack.\n\u201cThey ought to round them all up!\u201d He overheard one fifth year telling anyone who would listen in the dining hall one evening. \u201cKeep them locked up, away from normal people!\u201d\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t they tag them?\u201d Avni whispered, the next afternoon, when she, Sirius, Remus, Peter and Lily were watching the Gryffindor quidditch team practice. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s already a registry, and they can trace underage wizards - why not put a trace on dangerous animals?! It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not animals,\u201d Lily hissed through gritted teeth, \u201cThey\u2019re\npeople\n.\u201d\nRemus kept his eyes on the pitch. So did Sirius.\n\u201cTell that to the Mundays!\u201d Avni replied, straightening her skirt and giving Lily a superior look, \u201cTell that to this latest poor family.\u201d She shuffled closer to Sirius on the bench, hugging his arm,\n\u201cSirius, darling, I\u2019m cold\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGo in, then.\u201d He grunted, shaking her off, eyes still on James, shouting something at his keeper.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Avni frowned.\n\u201cYou heard me.\u201d Sirius replied, offhanded, \u201cPiss off.\u201d\nNone of them saw much of Avni after that.\nBut it didn\u2019t stop other people talking. Remus had to disband his study group early because they all wanted to know if he could recommend any good books on \u2018half breeds\u2019 and defence against dark creatures. In the end all he could do was tell them to talk to the DADA teacher, and if they didn\u2019t want help with actual school work, then they may as well leave him alone.\nLily found Remus working late that night in the common room trying to catch up on the work he\u2019d missed while in the hospital wing after the moon. He was exhausted and sore and extremely prickly but she came over and sat beside him anyway, resting a head on his shoulder, an arm around his back. She smelled nice, and gave him a gentle squeeze, sighing softly against his collar bone. She didn\u2019t speak, but Remus would always be grateful for that.\nIn mid-December, matters worsened. Remus received two letters.\n\n\nDear Remus,\n\n\nI hope that your sixth year is going well. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but as you may already know, there was an attack during last night's full moon.\n\n[Remus rolled his eyes at this. Why did adults always think that teenagers didn\u2019t read the news? Especially when they were in the middle of a war, and in concerned them directly?!]\n\nI have no doubt that Professor McGonagall will be speaking to you soon, but I thought I would get in touch. I have been talking to Alastor Moody, who is concerned for your safety. He tells me that you stay with the Potters every year at Christmas. The Potters are excellent people, and I know that James is a close friend, but, Remus, they cannot be relied upon to protect you. They would do everything they could - of this I have no doubt, but my feeling is that if Greyback attempted track you down, then the only place he could not find you would be Hogwarts.\n\n\nI am not telling you what to do, of course. But I am begging you to consider your own safety and the safety of those around you.\n\n\nBest wishes,\n\n\nL. Ferox\n\n\nWell, Ferox was quite clearly telling him what to do, even if he was just passing on instructions from Moody. \u00a0Remus\u2019s heart sank when he finished reading this letter, but there was worse to come:\n\n\nMr Lupin,\n\n\nIt has come to our attention that upon your seventeenth birthday next year, you will be of legal age as defined by your society.\n\n\nWhile the law of the United Kingdom states that you are still a child, we have been informed that your circumstances override this legislation.\n\n\nAs of 10th March 1977, you will no longer be under the care of St Edmund's Boys Reformatory. Any items or financial assets held in trust for you will be returned to you no later than thirty working days following this date. There should be no need for you to return to the premises.\n\n\nWe wish you the very best in your future endeavours.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nMrs. J. Orwell.\n\n\nFuck. Remus read this letter only once, then shoved it down into the very bottom of his trunk. He couldn\u2019t think about that now.\nHe told the marauders about the first letter - omitting the Greyback details, of course. He had to; there was no other way to explain why he could not come to London for Christmas. More time for homework, he told himself. He mightn\u2019t be the only student staying; the seventh years with NEWTs coming up might stick around to take advantage of an empty common room. He could probably enjoy quite a pleasant Christmas in the library, if he wanted to. Plus a Hogwarts Christmas dinner was nothing to turn your nose up at.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not bloody fair.\u201d James ranted, when he heard, \u201cYou\u2019re no danger to anyone, the full moon isn\u2019t until the new year!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the pack thing, though,\u201d Remus replied, loosening his tie and flopping down on the bed. It had been a very long day of lessons, and he had at least three hours of homework ahead of him. \u201cThey\u2019re worried I\u2019ll get captured or join up or something.\u201d\n\u201cI thought Ferox liked you,\u201d Sirius frowned, dropping his book bag carelessly in the middle of the room, \u201cHe ought to know you\u2019d never join\nthem\n.\u201d\n\u201cHe does know,\u201d Remus said, \u201cBut he thinks they might force me or\u2026 well, none of us really know what might happen if I met another one\u2026\u201d\nJames, Peter and Sirius exchanged an uncomfortable look. Remus pulled off his itchy school jumper, to give them a moment to think about it. When he resurfaced, his hair fizzing with static, he gave them his biggest grin,\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, anyway, I really don\u2019t mind. It\u2019ll be great to have some peace and quiet; I\u2019m looking forward to a Christmas break from you lot.\u201d\nJames chuckled, and shook his head. He grabbed his maroon quidditch duffle bag,\n\u201cNone of us believe you, Moony. Right, I\u2019ve got practice, then an hour for homework, then patrolling with Evans.\u201d Anyone else might have reeled off this list of obligations with a weary air of martyrdom. But James looked as though he was having the best day of his life. \u201cFancy it, Black?\u201d\n\u201cNah, you\u2019re alright, Prongs,\u201d Sirius shook his head. He hadn\u2019t stopped looking at Remus since he\u2019d unbuttoned his school shirt. \u201cYou go on, I\u2019ll get a head start on that Charms homework\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, right,\u201d James smirked, \u201cWho is it tonight, Florence again? See you.\u201d He clattered down the stairs, whistling a chirpy tune.\nSirius turned to Peter.\n\u201cYou go and watch him then, Pete, if you fancy?\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d Peter shook his head. He looked worryingly comfortable sitting on his bed, leaning against the headboard with his Charms notes scattered before him.\n\u201cOh right, you\u2019re probably seeing Dezzie?\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d he shook his head, licking the end of his quill nib, \u201cShe\u2019s got patrol tonight. And she says we need to get serious about our studies now we\u2019re NEWT students\u2026 Can I do my homework with you two?\u201d\nRemus and Sirius looked at each other. Sirius raised an eyebrow. Remus shrugged. Sirius got up.\n\u201cI tell you what - I forgot to return that book to the library. Better go and - oh, Moony, while I\u2019m at it, wasn\u2019t there another book you told me I should\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, right, yeah!\u201d Remus jumped up too, struggling into a clean woollen jumper, \u201cEr\u2026 it\u2019s a complicated title, I\u2019d better help you find it.\u201d\n\u201cOh, do you want to re-locate to the library, then?\u201d Peter asked, finally looking up from his notes.\n\u201cNo point,\u201d Sirius said, as they both bolted for the door, \u201cWon\u2019t take long\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t take long?!\u201d Remus muttered, on the stairs.\n\u201cI had to say something!\u201d\nThey made it through the common room without interference, but once they were outside in the halls, they were a bit lost.\n\u201cWhat about the fourth floor girl\u2019s--\u201d Sirius started,\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus snapped.\n\u201cFine. Er\u2026 Charms classroom is free, I think? On Fridays Flitwick finishes early and there aren\u2019t any clubs.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know that?!\u201d\n\u201cOh, shut up and follow me,\u201d Sirius smirked.\nThey put a basic alarm spell on the door and shoved a desk in front of it for good measure - but Friday afternoons were typically pretty safe; everyone wanted to pretend the classrooms didn\u2019t exist.\nAfterwards, they redressed, smoothed their hair and sat on Flitwick\u2019s desk smoking.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to actually have to go to the library now.\u201d Remus said, blowing a chain of rings.\n\u201cNah,\u201d Sirius shook his head, \u201cJust say they didn\u2019t have it in.\u201d\n\u201cWell that would be fine, except I was actually planning to do my Charms essay this evening\u2026\u201d\nSirius rolled his beautiful eyes and tossed his beautiful hair. Remus fought the urge to sigh.\nThe classroom was the same side of the castle as the quidditch pitch. They could hear the faint but shrill sound of James\u2019s captain whistle somewhere below them. Sirius exhaled smoke, wistfully. Remus wondered how much he missed playing quidditch. He wondered if he ought to ask, or whether that would be too much.\n\u201cMoony, are you definitely not coming for Christmas?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve got to trust Ferox. He knows me, he knew my dad.\u201d\n\u201cHe knew your dad? You never told us.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to tell you lot everything,\u201d Remus gave an irritated twitch, sucking hard on his cigarette. \u201cHe worked with him, we had a few chats about it, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if you trust him then.\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d Remus was aware of his tone, but did nothing to temper it.\n\u201cOk! I was just going to say\u2026\u201d Sirius swallowed, \u201cWell, I mean, I could stay too. Over Christmas. At Hogwarts. If it\u2019s ok with you.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Remus frowned, caught off guard, and turned to look at Sirius. \u201cDo you want to?\u201d\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be stuck all by yourself, James has his family - and Pete, if he gets really desperate.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but won\u2019t they expect you? James\u2019s parents? They\u2019re mad about you.\u201d\nHe caught Sirius\u2019s smile at that - a brilliant flash of elation, which made Remus\u2019s heart beat faster.\n\u201cThey can have a Christmas as a family, for once, without me crashing in. C\u2019mon, Moony, don\u2019t want to share the common room with me? I\u2019ll be quiet and let you study if that\u2019s what you really want.\u201d\nHe gave a coy smile, and Remus stubbed out his cigarette, leaned over and kissed him, hard. He still hadn\u2019t really got used to being able to do that.\n\u201cAs if.\u201d He said, pulling away, revelling in the warm blush in Sirius\u2019s cheeks."

            "content": "Wednesday 15th December 1976\n\u201cOk, so I probably won\u2019t have time for another one of these until next term,\u201d Remus told his study group, glancing at the nearby grandfather clock. It was almost nine o\u2019clock in the evening. He looked up at their eager faces, and had to look down at his papers again - it was unnerving, commanding that much attention, \u201cBut I\u2019m here almost every night anyway, so if you just had some quick questions\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Lupin,\u201d the group chorused as they began to tidy up and disband.\n\u201cHappy Christmas,\u201d he nodded, as they dispersed off to their own corners of the common room, or else to bed.\nHe fancied an early night himself. It was the last week of term and he\u2019d pretty much completed all of his work, unless his professors were feeling cruel enough to assign more in the last days before Christmas. He yawned, and stretched, leaning back on his chair with his eyes closed.\n\u201cAhem.\u201d Someone still sitting at the table cleared their throat awkwardly. Remus opened his eyes, embarrassed, and swung forward on his chair.\n\u201cOh, sorry \u2013 I thought everyone had gone.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Christopher replied, clutching a book, \u201cI just wanted to say\u2026 Merry Christmas.\u201d\nRemus felt an awkward twist of relief and guilt in his midsection. Poor Christopher.\n\u201cThanks \u2013 Merry Christmas to you, too. Big plans?\u201d\nThe younger boy shrugged,\n\u201cJust family. You?\u201d\n\u201cStaying here.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Not by yourself?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 Sirius Black is staying too.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. I heard about the stuff with his family.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d Remus did not want to talk about Sirius with Christopher at all, but least of all about the Black family. Christopher was pureblood too, and likely knew more than Sirius was comfortable with.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Christopher made to stand, \u201cSee you in January, I s\u2019pose.\u201d\n\u201cWait!\u201d Remus said, quickly, reaching out but not touching him. Christopher stood up, but looked down on Remus, his eyes hopeful, Remus looked down, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the way I spoke to you before the summer. I was a right git.\u201d\nChristopher did not dispute this. But he smiled,\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I hope it wasn\u2019t something I\u2026 did?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Remus shook his head, vehemently. He wished Christopher would sit down. \u201cNo, I promise, it was just me being a moody tosser. I had some other stuff going on, I shouldn\u2019t have taken it out on you.\u201d\n\u201cOk. Well... thanks for saying so.\u201d\nRemus smiled, feeling a bit better. Christopher bit his lip, then said, \u201cSo\u2026 do you fancy a visit to Hogsmeade in the new year? The book shop has a January sale on, or we could just get a butterbeer.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, Chris, I can\u2019t.\u201d Remus felt horrible, and he saw Christopher\u2019s face fall.\n\u201cRight. You\u2019re probably going with Potter and Black and\u2026 what\u2019s his face.\u201d\n\u201cPeter. But I\u2019m not \u2013 actually, I can\u2019t go to Hogsmeade, I\u2019m banned.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Really?\u201d\n\u201cReally,\u201d Remus nodded, earnestly, grateful that he didn\u2019t have to lie.\n\u201cIs it to do with why you\u2019re not a prefect anymore?\u201d\n\u201c...Yeah.\u201d Ok, that was a lie, but who was it hurting?\n\u201cWow, ok.\u201d Christopher raised his eyebrows and Remus wasn\u2019t sure if he was impressed, or mildly concerned.\n\u201cMoonyyyyy!\u201d Sirius\u2019s voice wailed down the stairs from the boy\u2019s dorms, \u201cJames is throwing snowballs at me, stop hiiiim!\u201d\nRemus laughed, and began getting up.\n\u201cSnowballs?\u201d Christopher said, wryly, \u201cIn your bedroom?\u201d\n\u201cThey open the window and scrape it off the roof.\u201d\n\u201cHelp us, Moony!\u201d Peter cried, \u201cWe need reinforcements!\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re friends with that lot,\u201d Christopher said, with a bristle of indignation, \u201cThey\u2019re so immature.\u201d\n\u201cSo am I,\u201d Remus shrugged, rolling up his sleeves and standing up, \u201cI\u2019m coming, lads!\u201d He yelled at the top of his voice, marching towards the staircase.\n* * *\nSunday 19th December 1976\nIt was a bitterly cold winter that year, and snow began to fall early over the castle. The marauders used this to great effect, and James perfected a spell which enabled the suits of armour which lined most of the classroom corridors to spit snowballs from their visors at various intervals. Remus liked the cold \u2013 or maybe he just liked wrapping up warm and sitting by the fire. In the winter at least no one asked why he wore long sleeves all the time.\nAnd he was excited \u2013 maybe more excited than he had ever been for a Christmas holiday. He loved seeing the Potters, and he loved their house and their village, and being witness to a proper family for once. But to be alone with Sirius for an entire week; that was something he could never have imagined happening, even two months earlier.\nThey walked James and Peter down to the edge of the grounds \u2013 as far as Remus could go.\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d James asked, one last time, \u201cFerox never said you weren\u2019t allowed, and Mum and Dad honestly wouldn\u2019t mind at all\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNext year, hopefully,\u201d Remus shrugged, \u201cIt might all be over by then. And I couldn\u2019t live with myself if anything happened to your family because of\nme\n.\u201d\n\u201cBlack? You\u2019re really going to say no to mum\u2019s mince pies?\u201d\n\u201cAh, but I\u2019m not, my dear Prongs,\u201d Sirius grinned from behind his red and gold scarf, \u201cShe sent some ahead, first thing this morning. I\u2019ve got an entire tin full.\u201d\n\u201cFoiled again,\u201d James smirked. He hugged Sirius, and then Remus, who was surprised by it. He couldn\u2019t remember if they\u2019d ever hugged before.\n\u201cGo on, get on the train, eh?\u201d Sirius punched him in the shoulder, \u201cYou\u2019ll have Evans all to yourself\u2026\u201d\nJames winked at him, then hurried away, Pete scurrying along behind him, waving to Remus and Sirius. The two boys staying behind stood there for a little while, watching the black cloaked students trudging through the pure white snow, all talking merrily about their plans for the break, the presents they looked forward to, and their eagerness to see their families.\n\u201cSeeya, Remus!\u201d Christopher grinned at him, pink cheeked as he strolled past, \u201cHave a good one!\u201d\n\u201cYou too,\u201d Remus nodded, smiling back. He felt much better, now the air had been cleared.\n\u201cThat kid again.\u201d Sirius murmured, \u201cWho is he?!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you before, he\u2019s a fifth year. In my study group.\u201d\n\u201cRight. He looks like a complete drip.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s ok.\u201d Remus smiled to himself, hoping Sirius didn\u2019t notice.\nA nasty voice came from behind them.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Potters kick you out too?\u201d\nRemus reached for his wand as they turned, and half expected to see Snape. He was surprised to find that is was Regulus Black standing there in the snow, face pinched with cold.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sirius replied, hotly, \u201cI\u2019m just staying here this year.\u201d\n\u201c\nWhy\n?\u201d Regulus asked, bluntly. He narrowed his eyes at his brother, as if waiting for the punchline.\n\u201cNone of your business, that\u2019s why. Now run along, little Reggie, I\u2019m sure mummy\u2019s waiting.\u201d\nRegulus tutted, and raised an eyebrow, as if to show that he would not rise to Sirius\u2019s bait. Remus hated it, and clenched his fists, which Regulus either saw, or sensed, because he gave Remus a sharp look, and Remus knew he was remembering their last altercation back in January. The younger boy visibly steeled himself, then spoke directly to Remus,\n\u201cNot a prefect any more, Loony Lupin? I wonder why? Something to do with my delinquent brother, perhaps? Surely that greasy half-blood Severus wasn\u2019t telling the truth..?\u201d\nRemus might have swung for him, if he wasn\u2019t busy stopping Sirius from doing the same. They struggled together in the snow, Sirius snarling,\n\u201cTake that back you brown nosing little--\u201d\nFortunately, Remus was stronger. Regulus walked off, cackling, towards Hogsmeade and the train.\n\u201cI can curse him from here.\u201d Sirius growled, once Remus let him go.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t,\u201d Remus replied. He turned back to the snow-capped castle, \u201cLook,\u201d he encouraged, \u201cWe\u2019ve got it practically to ourselves.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius said, distracted, still shooting glanced back at his brother\u2019s footsteps, \u201cC\u2019mon then, let\u2019s go in. Freezing my bollocks off.\u201d\nHis bad mood lasted until lunch time, when they went down to the Great Hall.\n\u201cBlimey.\u201d Sirius said, as they entered the room. It was almost completely empty, with only three students \u2013 a Slytherin seventh year and two Ravenclaw sixth years \u2013 seated at the same table, at the head of the room.\n\u201cI reckon it\u2019s the war,\u201d Remus whispered, as they approached the table, \u201cParents want their kids home this Christmas.\u201d\n\u201cJust you and me, then, Moony,\u201d Sirius grinned, \u201cThe orphans of Gryffindor tower.\u201d\nDespite the small party, the hall had been decked out in silver and gold, with glistening streamers hanging like angel hair from every rafter, a dazzling tree that seemed to glow from somewhere within its branches, and a flock of jolly red-breasted robins enchanted to circle the room and whistle familiar Christmas tunes. Remus thought that Flitwick had really outdone himself, this year.\nSirius sat beside him, rather than across from him, as usual. They didn\u2019t make much conversation with the rest of the party; the two Ravenclaws were obsessively quizzing each other on Arithmancy, and the Slytherin was deep in conversation with Professor Slughorn.\n\u201cRemember first year?\u201d Sirius said, as the food appeared \u2013 the house elves clearly weren\u2019t breaking for Christmas, \u201cIt was just you and me for Christmas then, too.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus smiled at his Shepherd\u2019s Pie, warmed by the memory. He had spent every Christmas with Sirius since he was eleven. \u201c\nElectric Warrior\n.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to have a listen, later.\u201d\nThey did, too. They stretched out on the rug in front of the fireplace and lay on their backs, playing the album at full volume. Sirius played\nMonolith\ntwice because he knew it was Remus\u2019s favourite, and Remus tolerated three replays of\nJeepster\nfor Sirius\u2019s sake.\n\nYou slide so good,\n\n\nWith bones so fair,\n\n\nYou\u2019ve got the universe reclining in your hair,\n\n\nCuz you\u2019re my babe\u2026\n\nFull, warm and content, Remus quietly drifted to sleep to the sound of Marc Bolan\u2019s pretty voice and twanging guitar. He woke up a little later, with a sore back. He turned his head and found he was alone on the carpet, and the record had stopped playing. Sitting up stiffly, Remus looked around for Sirius, who was seated a little way away, curled up in an arm chair, whispering into his compact mirror.\nRemus relaxed, leaning back on his elbows and watched gently for a while, the firelight warming Sirius\u2019s features with a fine glow, softening his sharper angles into supple grecian marble. He was so achingly beautiful. Obviously everybody knew that, Sirius\u2019s beauty wasn't just for Remus, but sometimes it felt like it was. It had nothing to do with wanting Sirius, then, it was something much more. It drove Remus crazy.\nEventually, Sirius whispered a goodbye to the mirror and snapped it closed. He smiled at Remus, and slowly unfurled, stretching his long limbs out over the sides of the armchair. Remus watched, unmoving,\n\u201cHow\u2019s James?\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Sirius replied, that look growing in his eyes that Remus had come to recognise as a signal that something wonderful about to happen. Sirius got up from the chair and sauntered over to Remus. \u201cMisses me, obviously.\u201d\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Remus said, repeating without listening, just watching Sirius\u2019s approach. He towered over him, the fire light now blazing across him like a flare, streaks of gold flickering in his pupils. He sank to his knees astride Remus\u2019s still prone body, and bent forward - not too far; not so far that Remus didn\u2019t have to stretch a little to close that extra space between them. He didn\u2019t mind. It was always worth the effort.\nThey were used to each other now \u2013 Remus had thought it had been good in the beginning, the very first time \u2013 but after a month of secretive exploration they had developed an intimate knowledge that Remus hadn\u2019t known you\ncould\nhave with another person. He felt as attuned to the various movements and reactions of Sirius\u2019s body as he was with his own. He knew the language in every gasp, or tightening, the code in his kisses, or the shapes Sirius traced on his own scarred skin.\nIt made the moment they parted all the more difficult, though. Sirius would be quiet at first, and Remus would just listen to his breathing, the hitch in his chest, the sighs of overwhelming calm. And he would wait for it.\nThe laugh, the cheeky grin, the slap on the thigh that told Remus it was over, and they were back to normal.\n\u201cFancy a mince pie? I\u2019m starving!\u201d\nThere it was. Sirius leapt up, grabbing his jeans and wriggling into them, before waving his wand,\n\u201c\nAccio\nbiscuit tin.\u201d the big royal blue tin came flying down the stairs and came at Sirius so hard it nearly knocked him over. \u201cOof.\u201d\n\u201cYour wandwork is too broad,\u201d Remus said, buttoning his own trousers and pulling on a t-shirt. Too warm for a jumper.\nSirius tossed him a mince pie, sitting back in the armchair, then rubbed his knee, wincing.\n\u201cCarpet burn.\u201d\n\u201cYou should see my back.\u201d Remus replied, as if they were discussing the weather. He settled into the sofa opposite Sirius.\nThey ate their pies quietly. When he finished, Sirius licked the sticky fruit off his fingers and brushed the crumbs from his torso.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to put you shirt back on?\u201d Remus enquired, folding the tin from his pie into neat triangular portions.\n\u201cNah. No one\u2019s here.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but still\u2026\u201d Remus made a fruitless gesture. Sirius smirked.\n\u201cPrude.\u201d\nRemus laughed, flicking the folded up tin at him.\n\u201cTart.\u201d"

Anyway, as Remus dressed, he listened and smiled. He didn\u2019t have a bad voice, really \u2013 nothing special, but in tune. He was obsessed with The Doors at the moment, and had perfected an imitation of Jim Morrison\u2019s deep American holler,\n\u201cC\u2019mon, c\u2019mon, c\u2019mon now TOUCH ME BAAABE,\u201d he bellowed over the hissing of the taps. It might have been endearing, even alluring, if he didn\u2019t spoil it by singing along with the trumpets, too, \u201cBA-DAH Ba-daah\u2026!\u201d\nHe exited the bathroom in a fog of steam, his skin flushed, his shirt damp from his hair. \u201cWhat?\u201d he cocked an eyebrow at Remus, \u201cNo applause?\u201d\nRemus rolled his eyes, opening the dorm room door,\n\u201cHurry up, I\u2019m starving\u2026\u201d\nIt felt weird to leave the isolation of Gryffindor tower, where they had already made themselves at home, and to enter the rest of the castle, where everything was the same. They were early to breakfast, and the two Ravenclaws, a girl and a boy, sat closer to them this time.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it ridiculous that they serve this much food when there are only five students?\u201d The girl, who had large cat-eye glasses and a mass of freckles, remarked, \u201cIt seems so wasteful\u2026\u201d\nThe plates in front of them had filled with fried eggs, bacon, sausages, black pudding, baked beans, fried tomatoes and toast \u2013 not to mention cereal, porridge and fruit juices.\n\u201cNah,\u201d Sirius replied, watching Remus pile up his plate, \u201cYou\u2019ve clearly never seen Moony here eat.\u201d\n\u201cShut up.\u201d Remus replied, his mouth already full.\nStill, the Ravenclaws watched, fascinated, until Remus was too embarrassed to eat any more. Fortunately, at that moment a distraction arrived in the form of the morning post owls. One landed in front of Remus. Three in front of Sirius.\n\u201cYou\u2019re popular.\u201d The Ravenclaw boy leaned over. He was skinny and smallish, with a beaky nose.\n\u201cDon\u2019t encourage him.\u201d Remus said. His own package was soft, and wrapped in lavender coloured paper. It was from Lily, he had no doubt. Sirius had five or six brightly coloured envelopes \u2013 none red, Remus noted with relief. No howlers from Walpurga this year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going ice skating before lunch,\u201d the Ravenclaw girl smiled, brightly, \u201cThe lake\u2019s frozen over. Want to come?\u201d\n\u201cSounds good,\u201d Sirius nodded, tossing his unopened post aside. Remus collected it up before they left the breakfast table, and took it up to the room with them.\n\u201cAre these all Christmas cards?!\u201d He asked, flicking through.\n\u201cOh, yeah, I think so.\u201d Sirius shrugged, opening his wardrobe and rummaging through the bottom, pulling out drawers and old shoes he didn\u2019t wear any more.\n\u201cWho are they from?\u201d\n\u201cWhoever.\u201d\nRemus frowned, then caught sight of something on Sirius\u2019s bedside table. Another pile of unopened cards. He started opening them. Sirius clearly wasn\u2019t interested.\n\n\u2018Dear Sirius, have a wonderful Christmas, lots of kisses, Imelda.\u2019\n\nHm.\n\n\u2018To the boy who holds my heart, merry Christmas and all my love, S.\u2019\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2018Darling Sirius, please meet me in Hogsmeade under the mistletoe for a kiss\u2026 and maybe more? Emmeline.\u2019\n\n\n\u2018My raven haired prince, I cannot rest until I am in your arms\u2026\u2019\n\n\u201cSirius.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Came his muffled response. He was half buried in the back of his wardrobe now, on his hands and knees.\n\u201cThese are all from girls\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAha!\u201d He finally reappeared, leaning back on his ankles, holding a pair of ice skates aloft, \u201cI knew I brought a pair during first year.\u201d\n\u201cAre you telling me your feet haven\u2019t grown since you were eleven?\u201d\n\u201cThey have a growing charm on them,\u201d Sirius explained, dusting them off, \u201cThey get bigger to fit me. Only the best for the Blacks!\u201d\n\u201cClever. These cards, though\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, those? What\u2019d you open them for? You want to be careful. One of them squirted perfume at me.\nPerfume\n.\u201d He pulled a face.\n\u201cAre these all girls you\u2019ve\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cReally, Moony, I\u2019m flattered. As legendary as I\u2019m sure my stamina is,\nno\n. They\u2019re just girls. They send me nonsense all the time.\u201d\n\u201cAll the time?\u201d\n\u201cOh c\u2019mon, what are you, jealous?\u201d Sirius ruffled Remus\u2019s hair, \u201cThey\u2019re just cards.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s get you some skates\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want any, I\u2019ll break my neck.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, I\u2019ll show you how to do it.\u201d\nRemus picked up the pile again and flicked through it.\n\u201cThere must be twenty here, altogether\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLook, Remus, why don\u2019t we find\nyou\na girlfriend, then you won\u2019t be so interested in\nmy\nlove life.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Remus stared at Sirius. He was being quite genuine, a look of mild concern on his face. Remus\u2019s heart sank.\nReally?\n\u201cYeah, I reckon that freckly Ravenclaw likes you. Or Marlene! What about Marlene? She\u2019s pretty, nice. Likes you.\u201d\n\u201cShe offered to snog me once,\u201d Remus said, but shook his head, \u201cIt was a joke though \u2013 Marlene\u2019s not interested in me. I don\u2019t need a girlfriend.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t knock it \u2018til you\u2019ve tried it,\u201d Sirius winked, \u201cRight, let\u2019s see what we can do about these skates\u2026\u201d\nIce-skating was marginally better than flying a broom, but not much. The lake was completely frozen, but Remus couldn\u2019t shake the thought it might crack at any moment, and kept patting his pocket to check he could reach his wand. Sirius, obviously, was a natural. So was the Ravenclaw boy \u2013 Arnold \u2013 and the pair of them were soon racing each other up and down the length of the ice. Remus watched them, nervously, trying not to wobble.\n\u201cHere,\u201d the freckly girl \u2013 Tina \u2013 glided over to him, smiling kindly, \u201cPut your hands on my shoulders if you want, and watch my feet,\u201d\nHe did so, gratefully, standing behind her as she dragged him steadily around in a small circle. He thought he was getting the hang of it.\n\u201cI wonder if the squid\u2019s ok\u2026\u201d he said, after they\u2019d been a bit too quiet for a while.\n\u201cUgh, I never even thought about that. Does it hibernate, do you think?\u201d Tina peered down at the ice with some interest, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve actually ever read anything about the squid.\u201d\n\u201cMe neither.\u201d Remus replied, letting go of her shoulders and attempting to do a few meters unaided. \u201cProfessor Ferox liked it, though, I saw him feeding it once.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d She looked up at him, earnest and curious, \u201cWhat did he feed it?\u201d\nRemus shrugged,\n\u201cNo idea. Something nasty looking.\u201d\n\u201cI miss Ferox,\u201d she sighed, \u201cHe really brought his lessons to life. I ended up dropping Care of Magical Creatures. Taking an extra course in Goblin Finance, instead.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that sounds\u2026 er\u2026 interesting.\u201d\n\u201cIt is,\u201d she nodded, without a trace of irony, \u201cI can lend you a book, if you like?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 thanks\u2026\u201d\nAfter lunch, Remus and Sirius returned to the tower. Remus noticed that the pile of cards had disappeared, but he didn\u2019t mention it. He lit the small bedroom fire and looked for a thicker jumper to wear,\n\u201cStill cold?\u201d Sirius asked, yawning.\n\u201cFreezing.\u201d Remus replied, pulling on a second pair of socks and raising his hands to the fire.\n\u201cShould have moved about a bit more, gets the blood pumping. Still,\u201d his tone changed; turned sly and teasing, \u201cYou had a nice chat with freckles?\u201d\n\u201cTina. She\u2019s interested in Goblin Finance.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent, you can marry rich.\u201d\nRemus threw a slipper at him.\n\u201cOi!\u201d Sirius barked with laughter, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to help you get out a bit, Moony, you ought to have other interests outside of that bloody study group.\u201d\n\u201cI think, if anything, I would be doing\nmore\nstudying if I started going out with Tina. Which I\u2019m not going to.\u201d Remus blew into his cupped hands, then held them up to the fire again. The cold just seemed to seep in and settle there.\nHe turned to look at Sirius, who was leaning against his headboard, staring. His lips curled into a wicked smile.\n\u201cBed\u2019s warm\u2026\u201d\n* * *\nFriday 21\nst\nDecember 1976\n\u201cBloody Regulus.\u201d\n\u201cIt was two days ago, get over it.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a prick.\u201d\n\u201cI know. Left a bit!\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t go any further left, there\u2019s no room.\u201d\n\u201cCareful! Not there\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOops. Anyway, you should have let me hit him.\u201d\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t going to hit him, you were going to break a knuckle. You can\u2019t punch.\u201d\n\u201cYes I can!\u201d\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. Look, can you please concentrate? You keep missing.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve punched loads of people \u2013 oops, sorry\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve play-fought with James. Not the same thing.\u201d\n\u201cOh, and\nyou\nknow how to punch, do you Moony?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I do, actually \u2013 aha, I win!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair. Can\u2019t we get closer?\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s cheating.\u201d\n\u201cOh fine, I forgot you were a stickler for rules,\nPrefect Lupin\n\u2026\u201d\nRemus folded his arms and let Sirius rant. He had won fair and square. They\u2019d been playing this new game for about two hours now, and Remus was by far the best at it. He had never beaten Sirius at anything on the first go. It was an excellent feeling, and he was going to lord it over him.\nThe game involved levitating various items they\u2019d found in the common room \u2013 gobstones, chocolate frogs, quills, slippers \u2013 and firing them at speed through the \u2018goals\u2019, constructed by cutting various sized holes in Peter and James\u2019s bedsheets, which they had strung up across the common room, dividing it. (Remus\nhad\nhad reservations about cutting up his friend\u2019s sheets out of boredom. But Sirius had reasoned that they couldn\u2019t very well cut holes in their\nown\nbedsheets, which were in use.)\nThe best part was that they never had to tidy up. Once they had got everything through the goals, all they needed to do was walk through the sheets and start again on the other side. This they began to do now, crossing to the half of the room with the fireplace in it. It was cosy.\n\u201cI wonder if this is what camping is like,\u201d Remus said, thoughtfully.\n\u201cNever been.\u201d Sirius replied. \u201cJames thought it was funny our family never did it.\u201d\n\u201cI always wanted to.\u201d Remus mused, beginning to levitate a crystal ball someone had carelessly let roll under the couch. \u201cBut I liked the idea of anywhere that wasn\u2019t St. Edmund\u2019s.\u201d\nHe frowned, slightly, having surprised himself. Why had he brought up St. Edmund's? He never talked about it in front of anyone at Hogwarts. Sirius didn\u2019t seem fazed.\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t blame you.\u201d He said, then, glancing at the floating crystal ball, \u201cYou\u2019re going to smash that.\u201d\n\u201cNo I\u2019m not, I'm aiming at the big settee.\u201d Remus demonstrated, reeling back his wand and then flicking it, sending the crystal ball whizzing through the very smallest hole, landing with a quiet \u2018thump\u2019 on the other side. Remus smirked at Sirius, who, shook his head in disbelief.\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary how good at this you are. Get you on a broom and you\u2019d make a bloody good chaser.\u201d\n\u201cNo, thanks. Your go.\u201d\nSirius selected a gobstone. They were easier to levitate, but much harder to aim. He was terrible at understanding his own limits.\n\u201cDid you play that muggle game, at St Edmund\u2019s?\u201d Sirius asked, casually, firing the gobstone too hard and missing the sheet altogether, sending it over the top.\n\u201cFoul.\u201d Remus said, \u201cWhat muggle game?\u201d\n\u201cWith all the running about and kicking. We saw them playing it when we\u2026 er, over the summer.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Football. No, I never liked it. Had too many bruises already.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sorry, I didn\u2019t think. Of course.\u201d Sirius went a bit quiet after that. Remus knew him well enough to recognise that he was building up to something - a question, or a declaration. In the meantime, Remus started shooting quills like darts through each hole in the sheets. Finally, Sirius had gathered up whatever courage he needed, or prepared whichever words. \u201cIs it really awful, living there?\u201d\nRemus lowered his wand. He hadn\u2019t ever complained about St Edmund\u2019s - not in front of the marauders, or anyone, except for Grant, because Grant\nknew\n. He was about to say \u2018Nah, it\u2019s fine, really\u2019, and shrug it off - but something stopped him. That was a lie, and there was no need to lie, just now.\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 not awful, but it is\u2026 noisy. You always have to watch your back, and no one really cares about you, much. They have to make sure you don\u2019t die, or get arrested, or starve or whatever, but they don\u2019t actually\ncare\n.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t in the mood to play any more. he reached into his back pocket and pulled out his cigarettes, lighting one with his wand tip, then tossing the box to Sirius. Sirius just held it, running his thumb over a loose bit of foil poking out from the join in the hinge.\n\u201cI know how that feels,\u201d he murmured. That was all he said, and it was enough, at the time. He quickly looked up and grinned, \u201cLook what I can do!\u201d\nHe slid a cigarette out of the packer and placed it between his lips. A look of concentration flashed in his eyes for a moment, then he snapped his fingers, and the cigarette lit itself. His grin widened around the fag, and he looked at Remus for praise.\n\u201cBlimey,\u201d Remus smiled, \u201cClever you.\u201d\n* * *\nSaturday 22\nnd\nDecember 1976\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it look like?\u201d Remus replied sternly, over the top of his textbook. He\u2019d spent a peaceful few hours all by himself in bed, until Sirius had marched in smelling of snow and hot chocolate. He\u2019d gone ice skating again, and Remus had begged off this time, looking for some quiet.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not studying at Christmas?!\u201d Sirius flopped down beside him on the bed, looking scandalised.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Christmas, it\u2019s not even Christmas eve, it\u2019s just a normal day. And I like reading, thank you very much.\u201d Remus shifted away from him, rolling back and raising the book over his head to read.\n\u201cHow times have changed, eh Moony?\u201d Sirius chortled, pulling off his socks and thick woollen jumper.\nIt was one the Potters had bought him - this year Sirius\u2019s clothes had been much more practical and comfortable than before - hardly anything specially tailored or finely cut now. He was still very obviously an aristocrat, born and bred - that was clear in his bearing, in every enunciated phrase he spoke. But he was happier, and that showed just as much. \u201cI remember a boy who hated reading, and homework, and--\u201d\n\u201cMm, and I remember someone who loved it, and came top in every subject\u2026\u201d Remus turned to him, finally. \u201cWhat happened, didn\u2019t like the competition?\u201d\n\u201cPfft. I could run rings around the lot of you, if I wanted to.\u201d This wasn\u2019t a boast. Sirius had always been exceptional when it came to intuitive magic, and intensely diligent at research - when it suited him.\n\u201cSo why don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cRather do other stuff,\u201d he shrugged.\nThe conversation had hit a dead end - that hardly ever happened with Sirius, unless you brought up his family. And this certainly had something to do with the Blacks - or at least Sirius thought it did. They wanted him to be in Slytherin, so he ended up in Gryffindor. They wanted him to be a good pureblood heir, so he befriended the Potters and ran away. They wanted him to get the best marks in his exams to prove that purebloods were better than anyone else - so he used his talents exclusively in ways that would annoy them.\nRemus returned to his book. Two lines down, Sirius gave a long sigh.\n\u201cI\u2019m\nbored\n.\u201d\n\u201cGo and play chess with the dynamic duo.\u201d Remus replied, re-reading the second line.\n\u201cUgh, not that bored. Spent all morning with them. They\u2019re ok, but merlin, everything\u2019s so\nliteral\n.\u201d\n\u201cTalk to James then.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s got family visiting, or something. We\u2019re talking after dinner. Anyway, not in the mood for talking.\u201d\nRemus put down his book.\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to disturb you, though.\u201d Sirius said, innocently, edging closer.\n\u201cIt can wait.\u201d\n* * *\nSunday 23\nrd\nDecember 1976\n\u201cShow me how to throw a punch, then?\u201d\n\u201cSeriously?!\u201d Remus sighed,\n\u201c\nDeadly\nSirius.\u201d The other boy waggled his eyebrows. Remus groaned. \u201cOh, go on,\u201d Sirius laughed at his face, \u201cShow me! Teach me something, Professor Lupin.\u201d\nThey were lounging in their pyjamas, in the common room. Gryffindor tower was still being cleaned nightly by the house elves, but the funny little creatures had had the sense to leave up the \u2018goal\u2019 sheets, even if they\u2019d tidied away all of the projectiles. The effect was that of a weird screen blocking out the windows on the other side, except for five pools of winter sunlight which streamed in through the cut out holes.\n\u201cOk, but you need something to hit that you won\u2019t hurt yourself on.\u201d\nThey ended up finding an empty bit of wall and performing a softening charm on it. Sirius stood there, eagerly, awaiting instruction. \u201cMake a fist.\u201d Remus said. \u201cNo, ok, not like that\u2026 yeah, put your thumb there, unless you want it broken. Ok, now you want it at shoulder level\u2026 yeah, then\u2026 er\u2026\u201d\nRemus eventually resorted to demonstrating a few times on the wall, before physically repositioning Sirius\u2019s arms in order to get the angle right, \u201cLegs apart, don\u2019t lean forward so much\u2026 ok, try it now\u2026\u201d\nIt took about twenty minutes, but in the end Remus deemed Sirius at least competent enough to give a black eye.\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you learn this?\u201d Sirius panted, elated with his success.\n\u201cSt Edmund\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah\u2026\u201d He ducked his head.\n\u201cNo, not like that,\u201d Remus shook his head quickly, realising that Sirius was probably imagining him squaring off against a group of huge, tough muggles. \u201cSome of the older boys taught me, a few summers ago. They were all a bit rough, liked a fight, but they were nice to me.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d Sirius\u2019s eyes gleamed with the light of understanding, \u201cWas this the year you began your foray into organised crime?\u201d\n\u201cMy what?! Oh, yeah, the fags. Yep, that summer.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget you stomping onto the train in those boots.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, don\u2019t,\u201d Remus covered his eyes with his hands. He cringed every time he remembered the way he had acted, \u201cI was so obnoxious.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think so. Anyway, you had good reason.\u201d Sirius rubbed his knuckles. They looked red from hitting the wall so many times, and Remus fought the urge to take Sirius\u2019s hand in his own and kiss every finger. \u201cDid you, er\u2026 ever learn anymore about Greyback?\u201d Sirius asked, tentatively, snapping Remus out of his daze.\n\u201cYeah, bits and pieces.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to clam up, but he did anyway, sitting down again and picking up a newspaper, just to have something to hold.\n\u201cMoony, I know you hate talking about him. It.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d He wasn\u2019t fooling anyone.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think\u2026 the attacks over the last few months...\u201d\nRemus looked up at him, just to check his expression. He looked anxious, but not frightened. At least, not of Remus.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he confirmed with a curt nod, \u201cIt was him. Moody told me.\u201d\n\u201cShit.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Shit.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think he\u2019d come after you?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t see why he would.\u201d The barefaced lie should have shocked him, or at least caused a pang of guilt. But this was justified, Remus told himself, this was to protect his friends. He touched the scar on his side over the top of his pyjamas. The fabric was thin, and if he pressed lightly he could feel the dimples and puckers in his flesh made by those dreadful teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he can do anything else to me now. The worst\u2019s already happened.\u201d\n\u201cMoony.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t a question or a request, and they both let it hang in the air.\n* * *\nMonday 24\nth\nDecember 1976\n\u201cDo we have any weed?\u201d Sirius asked as they walked back from breakfast on Christmas Eve. They\u2019d dodged yet another chess tournament with the Ravenclaws. Remus didn\u2019t actually mind the idea, but Sirius had decided they were intensely boring and not to be tolerated.\n\u201cWhen you say \u2018we\u2019,\u201d Remus replied, dryly, \u201cDo you mean me?\u201d\n\u201cFine, do\nyou\nhave any weed?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cBut you know where some is.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my little delinquent. C\u2019mon then, show me.\u201d\nRemus sighed,\n\u201cWe\u2019d have to go outside, to the greenhouses - and probably smoke it there too, I don\u2019t want the house elves getting a whiff. It\u2019s too cold, I\u2019d rather not.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, Moony. You haven\u2019t been outside in ages!\u201d\n\u201cI know, that was deliberate.\u201d\n\u201cCome on.\u201d Sirius was dragging him by the sleeve now, and because there wasn\u2019t much else to do, and he did quite fancy a spliff, Remus allowed it. They summoned their cloaks and left the castle, hurrying through the thinning sheet of snow down to the greenhouses. Behind them, buried in a tin box, Remus unearthed the illicit buds, wrapped up in twists of brown paper. He would have to pay back whoever it belonged to - if they found out, of course.\nThe greenhouses themselves had no snow on the roofs; being warm enough inside.\n\u201cWe could go in there?\u201d Sirius suggested, shivering.\n\u201cAre you mental? Spout comes down here twice a day to check on the mandrakes. It has to be somewhere else.\u201d\n\u201cThe shack?\u201d\n\u201cFuck that.\u201d Remus growled, without thinking. Sirius looked at him, surprised, and he shook his head, apologetically, \u201cI hate it there. Please, somewhere else?\u201d\n\u201cOk, sorry\u2026 er\u2026 ooh, I know!\u201d He grabbed Remus by the wrist this time, his ungloved hand still miraculously warm.\nRemus worked out where they were going before they got there - and it was actually sort of brilliant. They were just approaching the statue of the hump-backed, one-eyed witch, when the seventh year Slytherin student turned a corner at the other end of the hallway. They stopped still, probably looking extremely guilty.\n\u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d He asked, tilting his head, weighing them up.\n\u201cJust going for a stroll.\u201d Sirius replied, haughtily, \u201cIt\u2019s a free castle.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d The Slytherin rolled his eyes, bored. He kept walking past them, robes sweeping. Remus pulled out the map, as soon as he was out of sight, and watched the little dot with his name keep on towards the library.\nPerseus Flint\n.\n\u201cBleugh,\u201d Sirius pulled a face when he saw it, \u201cI think he\u2019s a relative\u2026\u201d\nThey entered the secret passage, cast an illuminating spell and rolled up their cloaks so that they could sit comfortably on the stone floor.\n\u201cShould have brought the record player,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cWe could get quite comfy here, dunno why I never thought of it before.\u201d\n\u201cYou and your cave-dwelling fantasies,\u201d Remus humoured him, laying out all of his paraphernalia. He liked rolling, it was a pleasant process. \u201cWe\u2019re\nnot\nspending the rest of Christmas in here.\u201d\nThey did spend the next few hours there, though, minds drifting, murmuring stupid jokes to each other or humming half-remembered songs. By lunchtime they were ravenous, and giggled all the way to the Great Hall. Sirius was red eyed, pale, with an inane grin, and Remus knew he wasn\u2019t much better off. He was just thankful Dumbledore wasn\u2019t there; he\u2019d see through them in an instant.\nThey were wrangled into a game of chess after lunch, once the table had been cleared, and Sirius actually became very competitive in his attempt to beat Tina, who must have been the reigning Ravenclaw champion. Remus was finding it difficult to concentrate, himself, and eventually lay his head down on the table and fell into a deep sleep.\nHe was nudged awake about an hour later.\n\u201cYou\u2019re snoring, Moony.\u201d Sirius chuckled.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Tina asked, her inquisitive face peering across the chess board. She had won, it seemed.\n\u201cHmm? Oh, yeah\u2026\u201d he tried to sit upright, feeling a twinge in his back as he did so. \u201cSorry, must not have slept enough last night.\u201d\n\u201cYou do look quite pale,\u201d she continued. Her eyes raked over him analytically, \u201cPerhaps you ought to go to bed for a bit? Sirius said you were busy all morning on Herbology, so I\u2019m not surprised if you\u2019re tired.\u201d\nSirius bean to giggle, compulsively, and Remus elbowed him hard in the ribs.\n\u201cYeah, I will go for a lie down, cheers.\u201d\nHe went back to the tower slowly, at first in case Sirius decided to follow him, and then because his hip hurt from sleeping in a stupid position. His head was clearer, and he decided to take a hot bath, to see if that would help at all. He took his Arithmancy textbook into the bathroom with him, hoping it would stop him from falling asleep again.\nHe\u2019d only been in the water for ten minutes when Sirius\u2019s voice broke into the dorm room,\n\u201cMoony?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m in the bath.\u201d He called back. The door opened, Remus tutted, \u201cDidn\u2019t say you could come in\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNothing I haven\u2019t seen.\u201d Sirius replied, archly. Remus blinked - was Sirius actually commenting on the recent turn their relationship had taken, or was this just another off handed remark? Perhaps he talked to James in the bath. Remus wouldn\u2019t be surprised. Sirius leaned casually against the sink, \u201cJames gave me the password to the prefect\u2019s baths, if you\u2019d rather go there?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine here, thanks.\u201d\n\u201cOk. I\u2019ve had an idea.\u201d\n\u201cDoes it involve smoking weed in a tunnel?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cBrilliant.\u201d\n\u201cNot just that, though - I fancy an outing.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d Remus smirked, closing his eyes and leaning back.\nHere we go...\n\u201cHow does the Hog\u2019s Head sound?\u201d\nRemus opened his eyes.\n\u201cIt sounds completely mad.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d Sirius grinned, \u201cWe\u2019ll go after dinner, then.\u201d\nRemus made half-hearted attempts to change Sirius\u2019s mind, but when a plan had been concocted, it was generally pretty much set in stone. Particularly if it involved breaking school rules.\n\u201cI\u2019m not allowed into Hogsmeade\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMoony, it\u2019s\nChristmas Eve\n.\u201d\nSo they went. After sharing a long joint in the tunnel (at the Honeyduke\u2019s end, obviously - Remus didn\u2019t fancy being stoned for the long walk through the passage), they crept up into the sweet shop (pocketing a few chocolate frogs on the way) and out into the dark, empty high street.\nThe Three Broomsticks was the only place that looked at all welcoming - but Sirius reckoned Rosmerta might shop them to McGonagall if she saw them in there.\n\u201cWhich would be total bollocks,\u201d he huffed, \u201cI\u2019m\nseventeen\n, I should be allowed to do what I like.\u201d\nThe Hog\u2019s Head was not nearly as inviting as the Three Broomsticks, but it still had a kind of atmosphere. The clientele were private, huddled in groups talking amongst themselves, and the barman surly, but he served Sirius and Remus without question, and they were able to find a table and stools without too much of a problem. There was an odd smell hanging about the place - something Remus liked a lot, but couldn\u2019t quite place. It stirred a strange sort of wanting inside him, which he tried to drown in whisky.\nThey drank a lot, and quickly, caught up in each other\u2019s overexcitement.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had a drink since Halloween.\u201d Remus said, daringly.\n\u201cUgh, I was so sick that night,\u201d Sirius laughed, \u201cI don\u2019t even remember half of it.\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d Remus bristled. Sirius caught his look and the smile fell from his face. His brows knit and he looked down at his half empty goblet,\n\u201cOf course I remember that part, Remus.\u201d\nHe felt a bit guilty after that. A small part of him still wanted to punish Sirius for the hurt he\u2019d caused, even if, on the whole, he wanted to forget it all and just be happy. Alcohol is fortunately the ideal solution for this particular problem. At least, Remus thought so. He smiled broadly,\n\u201cFirst time I got pissed,\u201d he drained his glass, \u201cWas that summer I got the boots and all that gear - I got so off my head I thought I was going to die.\u201d\n\u201cI got tipsy at a family banquet when I was thirteen,\u201d Sirius mused, ordering two more cups with a snap of his fingers, \u201cBut not as drunk as I got for your birthday that year\u2026 still, it was all the same to Mother, and out came the wand\u2026\u201d\nHe made a wide, slashing movement with his own wand hand, and imitated his mother\u2019s sharp, precise voice, \u201cA Black heir shows proper comportment at all times,\u201d\nslash\n,\nslash\n.\nRemus winced, thinking about Sirius\u2019s calves. Sirius glanced at him sideways, mid-slash, \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, folding his arms as the whiskies arrived, \u201cIt\u2019s not funny, I dunno why I act like it is.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re out, now,\u201d Remus said, seriously, \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to go back.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius slurred, slouching in his seat, \u201cIt\u2019s all Reg\u2019s mess now. Nasty little so and so - d\u2019you know how many times I took the blame for him? How many times I stood between\u2026 he used to be a proper little crybaby, but Mother hates crying, she says it makes men sissies, it makes them - well, whatever, some bollocks, but anyway, Reg would cry, and I would do something worse to distract her, and then she\u2019d do her thing,\u201d\nslash, slash.\nHis eyes were bright and his cheeks were pink, \u201cY\u2019know if either of us had just learnt not to get upset, then maybe\u2026 but I s\u2019pose Reg learnt, in the end, cold hearted fucker.\u201d\nHe took a big gulp. \u201cSorry, I shouldn\u2019t moan. \u2018Specially not to you. You know all about my bloody lack of self-control.\u201d\nIt took Remus a moment or two to realise that Sirius was talking about the Snape incident. He didn\u2019t want to talk about that, the conversation was melancholy enough as it was, and he knew what happened when you let the drink get you down.\n\u201cS\u2019fine,\u201d he mumbled, \u201cProbably a good thing, anyway. I hardly ever cry, I think I lost the ability at some point. Maybe I\u2019m like Reg.\u201d\n\u201cYou are\nnot\nlike Reg.\u201d Sirius said, vehemently, squeezing Remus\u2019s knee. Remus smiled at him, dopily, and Sirius withdrew his hand quickly, looking around furtively in case the gesture had been noticed.\n\u201cCan you smell that?\u201d Remus asked, feeling very drunk now. He stretched like a cat. It was so familiar, so deep and fascinating \u2013 like prey, or\u2026 no, it was just out of reach.\n\u201cStale beer? BO?\u201d Sirius suggested, making himself laugh.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s an animal or something\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSorry, mate,\u201d he shrugged, \u201cI could turn into a dog and have a sniff, but I think I\u2019m too drunk to remember how to turn back\u2026\u201d\nThey left the pub, shortly after that. The scent had infected Remus, unshakable and overwhelmingly desirable, he felt more than drunk - almost wolfish. He transferred this feeling to Sirius, and pushed him against the wall in the darkness of an alleyway, kissing him fiercely, pressing his hips against him. Eventually Sirius had to push him away, using more force than normal,\n\u201cHey,\u201d he whispered, \u201cNot here, someone\u2019ll see... \u201c\nThey dragged each other back to Honeyduke\u2019s, through the door and into the cellar - which Remus would have been more than happy with, but Sirius wouldn\u2019t touch him again until they were inside the dark, dank tunnel. They hadn\u2019t been together like this before after drinking - and neither of them had the presence of mind to light their wands, so it was pitch black, but Remus was hot with the whisky and Sirius was just as eager as him now they were alone, and it was the same as it had been, only better, more urgent and fluid and messy, and Remus felt a surge of courage, before pulling away and sinking to his knees, holding Sirius in place, and it was nerve-wracking, but\ngod\n, so worth it to hear that surprised gasp,\n\u201cWhat are you...? \u2013 oh!\u201d\n* * *\nChristmas Day 1976\nAs was to be expected, both boys awoke on Christmas Day with thumping hangovers.\n\u201cTell me there\u2019s a cure, Moony,\u201d Sirius wailed from his bed, \u201cYou\u2019re the one taking healing lessons\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\nYou\u2019re\nthe one taking Potions,\u201d Remus grumbled from under his pillow. \u201cPain is a potion thing, I do cuts and abrasions.\u201d\n\u201cUseless.\u201d\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\nBut it was no good, he was awake now, and there was nothing either of them could do about it. He clambered out from his bedsheets, head thudding at twice the tempo as he hobbled across the room to the bathroom. \u201cCold shower,\u201d he mumbled at Sirius\u2019s bed, \u201cThen breakfast. Fried eggs, trust me.\u201d\nThey couldn't face opening presents and left it, instead stumbling down to eat, without combing their hair or making much effort to look smart at all. Dumbledore was there, and smiled at them benevolently as they took their seats at the table,\n\u201cHappy Christmas, one and all!\u201d He boomed, cheerily, apparently oblivious to Sirius and Remus\u2019s wincing.\nBreakfast did improve things, somewhat - at least it settled their stomachs, and they eagerly returned to the tower afterwards to open presents. Remus got the usual assortment of quills, chocolates, books and knitwear as usual, and was very pleased to receive them. Nothing from Matron this year - he supposed she\u2019d decided to cut ties early, seeing as after his seventeenth birthday he would not be expected to return to St. Edmund\u2019s. He pushed that thought down with a cigarette.\nJames got in touch shortly after that, through the compact mirrors, and they both wished him a merry Christmas,\n\u201cAre you two ok?\u201d He frowned up through the glass, \u201cYou look a bit peaky.\u201d\n\u201cHungover,\u201d Sirius grunted.\n\u201cJealous.\u201d James replied.\n\u201cWeirdo.\u201d Said Remus.\nAfterwards, he took a nap, still worn out from the night before, and woke up in time for lunch - which, in Remus\u2019s opinion, was basically a perfect Christmas Day.\n\n* * *\nBoxing Day 1976\n\u201cWhy\u2019s it called boxing day, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cNobody knows,\u201d Remus yawned over his porridge, \u201cIt\u2019s one of the great mysteries of life.\u201d\n\u201cMust be a muggle thing. I\u2019ll ask my muggle studies professor.\u201d\n\u201c\nYou\ndo muggle studies?\u201d The Slytherin, Flint, was staring down the table at him.\nSirius threw two fingers up at him, then turned his back, ignoring him. Remus kept eating, the brown sugar melting on his tongue. Their knees were bumping under the table and it was delightful.\nSuddenly, the owls arrived, screeching into the hall with an unusual urgency. There were more than usual, as well. Remus realised that Dumbledore and McGonagall were not at breakfast. Tina, sitting opposite, got her post first and opened it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s from mum\u2026\u201d her eyes widened and she got up from the table at once, hurrying away out of the hall. Flint did the same, then Arnold.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Remus asked, as Flitwick sighed heavily, shaking his head. He passed the two remaining boys a copy of\nThe Daily Prophet\n. They leaned in together to read it.\n\u2018MUGGLES ATTACKED IN CHRISTMAS CRISIS\u2019\nblared the headline.\n\u201cLast night, while thousands slept safely in their beds on Christmas night, over one hundred muggles all over Britain were attacked in their homes. The Auror\u2019s office confirmed this morning that the attacks were magical in nature, and intended to cause harm.\nThe attacks took place in a number of locations, apparently targeting families with ties to the wizarding world - those with magical relatives or a history of muggle-magical relations. Offences range from minor jinxes to - in some cases - the use of unforgivable curses. There are no suspects at present. The minister for Magic is expected to make a statement later today.\u201d\nProfessor McGonagall arrived while they were reading, with Flint, Tina and Arnold in toe. Tina looked as though she had been crying. Flint was scowling miserably.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve all heard the news.\u201d The professor said, her voice thinner than usual; strained and tired. \u201cIf your parents have requested that you return home, then we will make arrangements at once to ensure you arrive safely.\u201d\n\u201cIs there anything we can do, Professor?\u201d Sirius stood up, frowning. Flint rolled his eyes.\n\u201cNo, Mr Black, thank you. Simply stay calm and carry on as normal.\u201d\n\u201cPlease, Professor Flitwick,\u201d Tina sobbed, \u201cI need to go home\nnow,\nit\u2019s my auntie\u2026\u201d Arnold put his arm around her shoulder, and whispered something comforting.\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Moony,\u201d Sirius murmured, \u201cLet\u2019s see if James knows anything\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything!\u201d James said, almost as soon as he opened the mirror to respond to their calling. \u201cDad\u2019s gone to the ministry with Moody, they let me read the paper, but there\u2019s nothing else. Everyone knows who did it, though - death eaters.\u201d\nSirius nodded, gravely.\n\u201cVoldemort?\u201d Remus asked, \u201cDoes he have that many followers? Over a hundred, the paper said, all over the country, in one night\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMust be more than anyone thought.\u201d James said.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Sirius sat up, his mouth a grim line, \u201cMy family alone would account for at least twenty.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re\nnot\nyour family,\u201d James said, fiercely. He and Sirius stared each other out for a while, and Remus shifted away, slightly, feeling intrusive. Sirius\u2019s temper was rising, Remus didn\u2019t need enhanced senses to work that out.\n\u201cIf Reg was one of then, I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBlack!\u201d James hissed, \u201cNo one knows who\nany\nof them were. Calm down, ok? Moony, you there?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus shuffled back into the mirror\u2019s view. James looked at him,\n\u201cDon\u2019t let him be a twat about this, right?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you want\nme\nto do?!\u201d Remus asked, nonplussed. Sirius\u2019s family crises were usually James\u2019s job. Remus\u2019s role was different.\n\u201cJust distract him!\u201d\nRemus personally didn\u2019t think that that sounded like the best idea. It wouldn\u2019t get rid of the problem - and James almost definitely wouldn\u2019t approve of Remus\u2019s distraction techniques. Sirius talked to James for a bit longer, and Remus left them to it. He thought longingly about the final joint, sitting in his bedside table upstairs. Probably not appropriate.\n* * *\nThursday 27\nth\nDecember 1976\nArnold, Tina and Flint went home on Boxing Day, so after that it was just the two of them (and the teachers, of course, but they seemed to be in a never-ending conference, McGonagall's face growing more and more weary every time Remus saw her).\nSirius sulked. He didn\u2019t want to go out, he didn\u2019t want to stay in. He didn\u2019t want to smoke, or drink, or eat, or play games. He just wanted to stew. Remus would have been quite content to let him, if only it didn\u2019t affect the entire atmosphere of the castle so much.\nHe tried James\u2019s distraction idea.\n\u201cWant to play that game?\u201d\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m rubbish at it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\u201cYou play it, then.\u201d He hunched down into his chair, arms folded. Remus sighed,\n\u201cWant to go out on your broom? I\u2019ll go with you and everything.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t have my broom here.\u201d\n\u201cWe can borrow them from the shed. Hooch won\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cNah, don\u2019t like using other people\u2019s brooms.\u201d\n\u201cSnob.\u201d\nNo response.\n\u201cChess?\u201d\n\u201cBoring.\u201d\n\u201cHomework?\u201d\nThat was just met with a dark look.\n\u201cWant a blow job?\u201d\n\u201cBloody\nhell\n, Moony!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! I\u2019m running out of options, jesus. Just trying to cheer you up.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to cheer up.\u201d\n\u201cYes, that much is clear.\u201d He fiddled with a loose thread on his sleeve, \u201cDo you want to go to the Potters?\u201d\nSirius looked up,\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d Remus said, honestly. \u201cIf you need to see them. If you\u2026 need James.\u201d\nFor a moment, Remus wasn\u2019t sure what Sirius was going to to. He seemed to consider the idea, and Remus wished he hadn\u2019t suggested it. But he shook his head.\n\u201cNah.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat sort of mate would I be if I left you here by yourself?\u201d\nThat got Remus\u2019s back up. He tugged at the thread on his sleeve, breaking it,\n\u201cWell you\u2019re not being much of a mate right now, to be honest. I know you\u2019re in a mood, but--\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not in a\nmood\n.\u201d Sirius spat, angrily, \u201cI\u2019m pissed off. Look, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like, having family out there doing merlin knows what - people\nI\u2019m actually related to\n, Moony.\u201d\n\u201cOh god, change the bloody record, will you?\u201d Remus groaned, getting up to prod the fire,\nsorry James\n, he thought,\nI\u2019m not you\n. \u201cPoor Sirius Black, the spoilt rich boy with the wicked family.\u201d\n\u201cOi, watch it.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m sorry, but we\u2019ve had six years of this, now. No, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like, because I don\u2019t have a family, let alone an evil one. You know what I\u2019ve got? A pack of bloody werewolves, waiting for me to come of age so I can finally go and join all the other monsters.\u201d\n\u201cMoony\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got some brutal fucking mass murdering child killer out there waiting for me. And not much else, to be honest. I don\u2019t have the Potters, or an Uncle - I don\u2019t even have a flipping future. So, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d rather not sit around here listening\nyou\nwhinge about how hard you\u2019ve got it.\u201d\nHe\u2019d only decided halfway through speaking that he was going to storm out, but he hoped it didn\u2019t look that way. He hadn\u2019t let himself get that angry in a very long time - and, as ever, it had been Sirius who\u2019d brought it out. He went to the library, because there was nowhere else, and because Sirius would almost definitely look there first. It was weird, walking through the empty halls and staircases. He could hear the portraits whispering as he passed, and didn\u2019t like it.\nWhen he got to the library, he realised that he didn\u2019t have a next step planned. He\u2019d left all of his homework back in the dorm, so he couldn\u2019t check his notes. He could summon them, he supposed - but that somehow defeated the point of storming off.\nRemus just went to the nearest shelf and pulled out a random book, sitting in the most comfortable chair he could find with it. It was on potions. Just his luck. For the first time in a few years, Remus used\nLetiuncula Magna\nto read. It was easier, and his head was too much of a mess to concentrate very hard. Still, it calmed him down.\n\u201cRemus.\u201d\nHe closed his eyes and breathed in, before looking up.\n\u201cSorry I shouted, Padfoot.\u201d\n\u201cSorry I was whinging.\u201d Sirius shrugged.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s ok to be angry sometimes. It\u2019s normal.\u201d Remus smiled, setting the book down. He got up and walked over to the library entrance, where Sirius stood, hands in his pockets, like a contrite child. \u201cI was a dickhead, though, I shouldn\u2019t have said those things.\u201d\n\u201cAh, they were true. I\u2019m a spoilt rich brat.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus grinned, ruffling his perfect hair, \u201cI don\u2019t mind, though.\u201d\n\u201cWe can do one of those things you wanted to do, now. If you still want\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cWhich one? Chess?\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Sirius raised an eyebrow, \u201cDefinitely chess.\u201d\n* * *\nFriday 28\nth\nDecember 1976\n\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d Sirius asked, late in the afternoon. He had finally allowed Sirius to get on with his homework, and was playing a game of solitaire with a deck of cards he\u2019d found. Remus had never seen Sirius occupied in such a quiet activity before, and kept sneaking glances.\n\u201cHm?\u201d He looked up from his Herbology, pretending he\u2019d been completely absorbed in petal identification.\n\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d Sirius repeated, still looking at his cards, \u201cThe Greyback stuff?\u201d\n\u201cOh, that.\u201d Remus\u2019s throat went dry. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Thanks, though.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re sure\u2026\u201d Sirius said, lifting a card and placing it on another pile. \u201cJust because you said that you didn\u2019t think he was after you, but then yesterday you said\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d Remus said, feeling his pulse speed up, \u201cIt just\u2026 I don\u2019t want to think about it right now. Ok?\u201d\n\u201cOk, then.\u201d Sirius looked up and smiled.\nRemus smiled back, and felt such a surge of love for Sirius Black that it made him dizzy.\n* * *\nSaturday 29\nth\nDecember 1976\n\u201cFoul!\u201d Remus cheered, gleefully, as Peter\u2019s trainers sailed over the top of the goal line.\n\u201cBalls.\u201d Sirius sighed. \u201cKnew that was a bit ambitious.\u201d\n\u201cWe should leave this up,\u201d Remus said, readjusting the hanging bedsheets, \u201cImagine playing this with more people.\u201d\n\u201cEvans would make us take it down.\u201d\n\u201cOnly after she\u2019d had a go, I bet.\u201d\n\u201cYou like her, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nRemus gave him a sharp look,\n\u201cNot this again\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Sirius smirked, levitating an apple from the fruit bowl the elves had left out.\n\u201cYou\u2019re obsessed with finding me a girlfriend.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not. I just don\u2019t want you to miss out on any of that stuff.\u201d Sirius got the apple through the largest hole and punched the air, \u201cYes!\u201d\n\u201cFive points.\u201d Remus returned, dryly, \u201cYou\u2019re still twenty down.\u201d He cleared his throat, \u201cAnd I\u2019m not missing out on anything.\u201d\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t\nthink\nyou are, Moony, but I\u2019m just saying--\u201d\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be angry with me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Remus fired an inkwell at the sheets so hard that he missed, and splattered the white fabric with a bright blue splodge.\n\u201cYou seem pretty angry.\u201d Sirius lowered his own wand, turning to Remus. Remus didn\u2019t look at him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a girlfriend, how many times?\u201d\n\u201cI know you\nsay\nthat, but\u2026 I can\u2019t help but think there must be a reason behind it\u2026 I think I know why.\u201d Sirius shifted, awkwardly, and Remus looked at him, sideways, his heart pounding in his chest. He should have expected this, eventually. \u201cIt\u2019s because of the werewolf thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Sirius said.\nRemus opened his mouth, then closed it again. Really?\nReally\n?! He sat down, head in his hands, and tried not to laugh. Sirius mistook this for something else, and said, gently, \u201cYou\u2019re worried about a girl finding out, right? But, I mean, Evans knows, and she\u2019s fine about it, so I don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t find someone else\u2026 and your scars aren\u2019t as bad as you think they are.\u201d\n\u201cOh really?\u201d Remus snorted.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius nodded, encouragingly, \u201cThey\u2019re cool. And you\u2026 I mean, y\u2019know, you\u2019re quite good looking. You\u2019re tall and you\u2019re um... \u201c\nRemus looked up at him, curiously. Sirius Black was blushing.\nJesus Christ,\nRemus thought,\nwhat have we got ourselves into?\n* * *\nSunday 30\nth\nDecember 1976\n\u201cHow far do you reckon Pete and Desdemona have gone?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, why are you thinking about that?\u201d Remus wrinkled his nose in the dark.\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Sirius replied, \u201cCan\u2019t sleep.\u201d\nRemus rolled onto his side, and peered across the bedroom, to where Sirius lay in his bed. He could clearly make out his pale outline, he was lying on his back, staring up at the canopy, arms behind his head.\n\u201cNot tired?\u201d Remus asked. They\u2019d both been in his bed, only an hour before. He felt the absence keenly, but there was nothing to be done about it.\n\u201cS\u2019pose not. Keep thinking about tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cTomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cLast day of the year.\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d It would be their last day alone, too. Everyone was due back on the first of January, and the bubble they had lived in for the past eleven days would burst. \u201cMaking resolutions?\u201d Remus asked, yawning.\n\u201cNot really. Just the usual stuff.\u201d He sounded sad. \u201cStuff I should stop doing.\u201d\n\u201cWell.\u201d Remus thought quickly, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you think about the stuff you\nwant\nto do?\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I dunno,\u201d Remus stifled another yawn, \u201cLike how you\u2019re always talking about going to London? Muggle London. Properly, I mean, not just a dodgy squat in Mile End.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah!\u201d Sirius said, cheering up, \u201cWe should do that, in the summer. Can we go to Carnaby Street?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t see why not.\u201d\n\u201cI want to learn to play guitar.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you do\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd go camping.\u201d\n\u201cMmm.\u201d\n\u201cAnd see Bowie in concert.\u201d\nRemus smiled, softly, listening to Sirius\u2019s dreams as he drifted to sleep.\n* * *\nMonday 31\nst\nDecember 1976\n\u201cDo you know any sewing spells?\u201d Remus asked, thoughtfully, sipping a mug of tea from his favourite armchair and looking up at the bedsheets which would have to come down today.\n\u201cWhy would I know sewing spells?\u201d Sirius asked, from the floor. He was sitting over a cauldron with a book beside him, trying to create his own fireworks to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\u201cI was just thinking about the sheets\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPfft,\u201d Sirius waved a hand, \u201cThey won\u2019t even notice.\u201d\n\u201cOught to fix that crystal ball we broke, too.\u201d\n\u201cNah.\u201d\n\u201cAnd probably should look for those chess pieces that went- er - missing\u2026\u201d Two days ago they had accidently fired an entire set out of the window. They\u2019d summoned most of the pieces back, but the queen and two knights were still in the bushes somewhere below.\n\u201cLook, everyone knew it was just going to be the two of us here for Christmas,\u201d Sirius replied, waving his wand carefully over the cauldron, \u201cIt was\ntheir\nresponsibility to lock up anything they didn\u2019t want to get shot out of the window.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Peter\u2019s bed?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s stopped making that weird noise, now.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but it still giggles when you sit on it.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll work out how to fix it, or get Desdemona to help him. You worry too much.\u201d\nBANG\nThe contents of the cauldron exploded in Sirius\u2019s face, knocking him backwards and filling the room with a plume of lime green smoke. Remus ran for the window, coughing, trying not to laugh at Sirius\u2019s startled expression, face black with soot.\n\u201cI told you we should just ask Flitwick.\u201d\nThe dust settled, and now the whole room was covered with a fine green film. Remus raised an eyebrow. Sirius smirked,\n\u201cLeave it to the house elves? I\u2019m having a shower.\u201d\nHe did go to Flitwick, in the end, and the tiny Charms professor was only too pleased to impart some advice on creating the perfect fireworks \u2013 without any messy potions or cauldrons. \u201cHe made me promise not to tell McGonagall that he taught me, though,\u201d Sirius laughed, \u201cHe\u2019s really gone up in my estimation, ol\u2019 Flitters.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe you went without me.\nI\u2019m\nbest at Charms.\u201d Remus muttered, as he climbed out of their bedroom window to sit on the ledge beside Sirius.\n\u201cYou were sleeping!\u201d Sirius nudged him jovially.\n\u201cStill.\u201d Remus grumbled, folding his arms against the cold. Their legs dangled precariously over the edge, but he wasn\u2019t as afraid of heights as he had once been. Thank James\u2019s relentless broom training for that. He\u2019d only taken a nap earlier to ensure he would be able to stay up until midnight - which was now only minutes away.\nIt was very quiet, outside, and other than the occasional animal noise rising from the Forbidden Forest, or the soft hooting of the owls in the owlery they might have been completely alone in the world. They were content to sit in this silence, as the last moments of 1976 slipped away under a frozen winter sky. Remus felt a deep sense of satisfaction and contentment. It was bittersweet. He was looking forward to seeing James, Peter and the girls again. He was looking forward to the spring term. But still, as soon as the Hogwarts Express pulled into the station the next afternoon, everything he and Sirius had shared over the past twelve nights would have to be tidied away and locked up until it was safe to resurface.\nSirius raised his pocket watch - one he had received for his seventeenth birthday from the Potters. He held it up so that Remus could read it too. Five seconds to go. Sirius smiled at him, and squeezed his knee.\n\u201cReady?\u201d He lifted his wand.\nRemus grinned back, and nodded,\n\u201cReady.\u201d"

He and Sirius beamed at each other, until Remus thought that the two of\nthem\nought to be snogging, not Sirius and Remus. Lily and Peter climbed out of the carriage behind, and Remus hugged her and nodded to him.\n\u201cGood Christmas?\u201d Lily asked, \u201cThanks for the chocolates!\u201d\n\u201cThanks for the gloves,\u201d he replied waving them at her to demonstrate, \u201cReally warm.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, cheers for the gloves, Evans,\u201d James waved his own wool covered hands.\nLily blushed deeply, and mumbled something about not wanting to leave anyone out.\nEarlier, Remus and Sirius had walked alone through a castle of empty halls echoing and hushed with the whispers of the portraits and the eerie drifting ghosts. But as they all returned together, it was as if the school was transformed in an instant. The flagstones rattled with the busy chatter of friends reuniting, every arch and column filled with black robed students. Remus felt he was awakening from a strange and quiet dream.\nIt was incredible how quickly everything settled back to normal - Peter and Desdemona started a fight almost immediately, Lily hexed James halfway through dinner, Mary had tales of her newest boyfriend, which Marlene was rolling her eyes at. Sirius had eyes only for James, of course, but Remus was keenly aware of the looks he was getting from other quarters - all of the unanswered Christmas cards would be coming home to roost.\n\u201cSo, what did you two get up to?\u201d James asked, mouth full of roast beef, \u201cYou didn\u2019t give much away when we spoke\u2026\u201d\nSirius and Remus looked at each other only for the tiniest moment, long enough for Remus to note the spark of panic in Sirius and grin at James,\n\u201cSpent most of it trying to keep Padfoot out of trouble, obviously.\u201d\nJames and Peter laughed, and that was all anyone needed. Sirius settled back, shoulders lowering, and Remus watched him from underneath his eyelashes. This wasn\u2019t going to work. It was all too impossible.\nThe night before, just before he drifted to sleep, Remus had made a decision. He had to talk to Sirius. The irony was not lost on him, that after days and days of nothing\nbut\ntalking, the solution seemed to be\nmore talking\n. But this time he would make Sirius listen.\nHe only needed an opportunity, which he accepted would not be easy. Opportunity, and just a\nbit\nmore time. He wasn\u2019t brave enough just yet. Just now, every song he heard reminded him of Sirius; every soppy sentence in every novel. Maybe he wasn\u2019t quite ready to give it all up.\nSirius certainly wasn\u2019t. Remus had tried questioning him, after everyone had been back for a few days, and Sirius had accepted an invitation to Hogsmeade from Emmeline Vance.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think we ought to stop? Isn\u2019t it a bit confusing for you?\u201d\n\u201cWhy would it be confusing? It\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d Sirius raised his eyebrows in genuine surprise.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Remus said, quietly. He was glad they were in a cupboard, and it was dark, \u201cOh, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cWell, no. She\u2019s a girl. You\u2019re Moony.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does\nthat\nmean?\u201d\n\u201cIt just means\u2026 you know. You and me\u2026 we\u2019re not\u2026 and she\u2026 erm... oh, for goodness sake,\u201d he got irritated, and gave up explaining, \u201cI just can\u2019t see any reason to stop, ok? It\u2019s fun, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus sighed.\n\u201cLook, if someone asked\nyou\nout, that would be fine, obviously.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Remus nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s nice of you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, c\u2019mon, don\u2019t be like that\u2026\u201d Sirius started kissing his neck, and Remus was in no position to argue, after that.\nHe\u2019d had plenty of opportunities, really. He was as weak as Sirius, when all was said and done.\nBesides, it was just a secret \u2013 as Sirius had once said, long before everything got complicated; \u2018you\u2019re not Moony if you don\u2019t have a secret\u2019. He could\ndo\nsecrets. Except. It was getting harder \u2013 especially around the full moon, when his nerves were thinnest and every emotion burned just beneath the surface. Then he would see Sirius with some girl or another, watch as she picked fluff from his school jumper or straighten his tie or wrap her arms around his waist and he would want to tear her to pieces.\nSometimes he thought it must be so obvious, surely everyone could tell \u2013 surely\nJames\ncould tell? Remus would be sitting with them, or walking beside them, or eating breakfast, and his eyes would catch Sirius\u2019s, and how could no one else\nfeel\nit?\nIt made him feel guilty. Remus wondered if he was lying to Sirius even more than Sirius was lying to himself. Remus was being dishonest about what he wanted, about how much everything meant to him, and in the end he could see that he was confusing Sirius even more. The best thing was to lay everything out, then deal with the consequences.\nNot yet, though. Maybe after the full moon.\n* * *\nThursday 6th January 1977\nRemus woke up outside. This was very wrong. The sky above was blue and cracked with clouds. There were trees, black, crooked branches. The breeze was cool on his skin, and the leaf litter soft and mulchy beneath him. Not right, but more pleasant than usual. He blinked against the morning light, and looked around, to see his three friends watching him cautiously. Sirius pulled off his cloak quickly, and handed it to Remus,\n\u201cHere, it\u2019s chilly\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened? Why aren\u2019t we back in the shack?\u201d Remus frowned, pulling the cloak around himself. He noticed that James was panting hard, and holding his arm in a strange way, \u201cDid I hurt you, Prongs?\u201d\n\u201cNot on purpose,\u201d James shook his head, obviously keen to keep Remus calm, \u201cYou were\u2026 you kept trying to get away from us, that\u2019s all. We couldn\u2019t get you to follow us like normal, not even Padfoot.\u201d\n\u201cI remember\u2026\u201d Remus frowned, and climbed to his feet, \u201cWere we hunting?\u201d\n\u201c\nYou\nwere.\u201d Sirius said, looking at him oddly, \u201cThere was something you really wanted to get at. In Hogsmeade.\u201d\n\u201cIn Hogsmeade..?\u201d It all came flooding back like a bad dream. That scent. He\u2019d smelled it first on Christmas Eve in the Hog\u2019s Head, and even then he had known what it was. How could he be so stupid? \u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re not hurt?\u201d Remus asked, again, looking at James.\nJames nodded fervently, his messy hair bobbing in the morning breeze.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he jerked his head, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get you back to the shack before Madam Pomfrey gets there\u2026\u201d\nHe followed them, treading gingerly over the stony forest floor in bare feet.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not too far,\u201d Sirius said, walking slowly beside him, \u201cWe managed to sort of\u2026 shepherd you in the right direction... but you kept trying to give us the slip.\u201d\n\u201cYou all have to go back to the castle,\u201d Remus said, unable to meet their eyes, \u201cI think\u2026 I think something might have happened last night.\u201d\n\u201cNothing happened, Moony,\u201d Peter said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t lose sight of you once, honestly.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Remus nodded. The shack was in sight now, \u201cBut you still ought to go. Trust me.\u201d\nThankfully, they did; all still shaken by whatever had taken place just before Remus returned to his human body. Remus entered the shack, dressed and sat quietly on the bed to wait for Madam Pomfrey. She did not come. Instead, it was McGonagall who opened the trap door, almost an hour after daybreak.\n\u201cMr Lupin,\u201d she said, in the usual brisk manner she used when a detention was forthcoming.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Madam Pomfrey?\u201d He asked, feeling very cold all of a sudden.\n\u201cShe\u2019s on other business this morning, in Hogsmeade,\u201d The professor said, her face lined with concern, \u201cShe asked me to attend you. Are you injured?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. What happened in Hogsmeade?\u201d\n\u201cCome along, Lupin,\u201d his teacher said, turning quickly back into the tunnel, \u201cIf you\u2019re quite well, then we should be getting back to the castle as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he had to walk quickly to keep up with her, which wasn\u2019t easy when your bones were still settling back into their usual positions, \u201cPlease, professor, what happened in Hogsmeade?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t--\u201d\n\u201cIt was a werewolf, wasn\u2019t it? An attack?\u201d\n\u201cRemus.\u201d She turned and looked at him. They were eye level, these days, and he was still growing. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d She asked, sharply.\n\u201cI could smell it - the other one. I knew they were nearby. It wasn\u2019t me! I swear.\u201d\n\u201cNo, we would know if you had escaped.\u201d She seemed very sure about that, so he didn\u2019t object.\n\u201cWas it bad?\u201d\n\u201c...Yes.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s dead?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. Now I really can\u2019t talk about it, so let\u2019s just get you back to the castle, all right? I know that Poppy usually keeps you in the infirmary for a day or so to rest, but do you think you could go to your lessons as usual today? I think it might be best to avoid any suspicion.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cYou can come to me if you feel unwell at any point.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d His voice was low and empty. He had never met another one. Now he knew there was one close by.\n\u201cRemus,\u201d McGonagall said, giving him a severe look, \u201cThis was not your fault. This was nobody's fault. Do you understand?\u201d\n\u201cYes, professor.\u201d It was better just to tell adults what they wanted to hear, most of the time. Perhaps he could write to Ferox, or even Moody. Remus desperately wanted to talk to Sirius about it privately, but he supposed he might have to wait a little while.\nHe knew it all, now. There had been another wolf in Hogsmeade over Christmas, and it had been waiting for the full moon. They had to be on Voldemort\u2019s side \u2013 on Greyback\u2019s side \u2013 because, in Remus\u2019s opinion at least, you\u2019d have to be mad or evil or both to place yourself near other people during a full moon. Ought he to have told somebody that he\u2019d recognised the smell on Christmas eve? Could he have saved a life? He hadn\u2019t been\nsure\n, and he hadn\u2019t wanted to get in trouble for sneaking out.\nThe breakfast hall was buzzing with the news; owls were flying back and forth. Lily sat deliberately next to Remus and squeezed his hand under the table. He squeezed back, gratefully, and thought how easy it would be to fall in love with her if he was that type of man.\n\u201cIt\u2019s horrible,\u201d Marlene said, tearfully, reading the paper over Mary\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThat poor woman, murdered in her bed\u2026\u201d\nIt had been a young couple, who had moved to Hogsmeade in November. Both magical, but she was muggle born. She was dead, her husband bitten and apparently at St. Mungo\u2019s. Their wedding photo graced the front page of the\nProphet\n, and made Remus sick to look at.\n\u201cIs it still on the loose?\u201d Remus asked, keeping the hand which was not holding Lily\u2019s flat on the table, so nobody could see him trembling.\n\u201cLooks like,\u201d Mary confirmed, still engrossed in the article, \u201cNo one could catch it. Tonight\u2019s not a full moon, so we\u2019re all safe for at least another month, I suppose\u2026 that\u2019s the trouble with werewolves, if you don\u2019t catch them on the moon, then how are you supposed to catch them at all?\u201d\n\u201cThere must be a test, or something,\u201d Marlene frowned, \u201cA revealing charm.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Mary replied, thoughtfully, \u201cMaybe\u2026 but then you might end up finding the wrong one\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell, it sounds like they\u2019re all on\nyou-know-who\u2019s\nside anyway, so I don\u2019t think it matters\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about something else.\u201d Lily said, loudly.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d James nodded, \u201cDefence Against the Darks Arts next \u2013 anyone had any luck with their patronus, yet?\u201d\nOnly James had, so far. Half an hour later, the class stood slack-jawed and watched James produce a spectacular silver stag, which galloped ghostly around the room. The teacher applauded, and invited everyone else to try \u2013 with varying levels of success. Lily managed a wisp of something, but it wasn\u2019t clear yet what it was. Peter had no luck at all, and (to the surprise of nobody) Sirius cast something distinctly dog-shaped, but without the solid brightness of James\u2019s creation.\nRemus didn\u2019t so much as feel his wand flinch. He oughtn\u2019t to have been surprised \u2013 on a morning like that it was impossible to pin down a happy thought for very long, besides which, he was exhausted from the full moon.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get, it, Moony,\u201d Sirius encouraged, patting him awkwardly on the back as they left the classroom. \u201cYou always do.\u201d\nRemus nodded, wondering what Sirius\u2019s happy thought was. Remus had been using various memories of their Christmas together, though with poor results.\n\u201cMy mind\u2019s elsewhere, to be honest,\u201d he said, quietly, so that only Sirius could hear him.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Sirius replied, just as quietly, \u201cThat\u2019s to be expected.\u201d\n\u201cI knew about it.\u201d Remus whispered, quickly, as the last few students left the room. Sirius stopped, staring at him with that awful look he\u2019d had that morning. Remus grabbed his arm, \u201cI mean, not exactly, I didn\u2019t know that would happen, but\u2026\u201d\nSirius closed the door behind the last student, and whispered a silencing spell.\n\u201cBut what?\u201d\n\u201cRemember when we went to the Hog\u2019s Head?\u201d Remus said, quickly, and still whispering because he couldn\u2019t seem to raise his voice. Sirius nodded, \u201cI smelled something.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you were just pissed\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus nodded, \u201cI think maybe I did too \u2013 or I thought it was\u2026 um\u2026 well, you, because I wanted\u2026\u201d he cleared his throat, \u201cAnyway, it was definitely another one. A werewolf. I think it was female.\u201d\n\u201cNot Greyback, then.\u201d Sirius said, with a look of immense relief.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus said.\n\u201cWell, thank Godric for that.\u201d Sirius grasped Remus\u2019s shoulder. His face turned to worry again, just as quickly, \u201cBut Moony, if\nyou\ncould smell\nthem\n, do you think that they could\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think so.\u201d\n\u201cOk. Ok, well they didn\u2019t come after you, so\u2026 Everything will be fine.\u201d He was still holding Remus by the shoulder, keeping him in place, like an anchor. It was desperately needed, Remus thought. Every instinct in him said to run.\nRemus thought for a moment Sirius might kiss him, but they had another lesson to go to, and the DADA teacher had returned, knocking on his own classroom door in confusion. Sirius looked disappointed (or at least, Remus thought so \u2013 it might have been wishful thinking) and gave a final squeeze before they parted.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell James!\u201d Remus said, hurriedly, as they unlocked the door, \u201cPlease, don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\n\u201cOk, Moony,\u201d Sirius nodded slowly, \u201cAnything you want.\u201d"

            "content": "Friday 14th January 1977\nRemus tossed and turned under his bedsheets, unable to settle. His bed at Hogwarts rated as one of the most comfortable he had ever slept in \u2013 a close second to the one he used at the Potter\u2019s, anyway. Rarely had he ever struggled to sleep in it. But the past few nights had been almost entirely sleepless.\nHe couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the werewolf in Hogsmeade, about the poor dead woman, and the man who would wake up in St Mungo\u2019s to find that his entire life had been destroyed. Remus had been afflicted for as long as he could remember \u2013 the thought of this man being forced to transform for the first time \u2013 probably alone, probably still grieving. It was unbearable. He felt a horrible, unmoveable sense of guilt.\nSo Remus did not sleep. He had been resorting to reading most of the night, until he couldn\u2019t keep his eyes open any longer. Tonight, he couldn\u2019t even concentrate on a book.\nHe rolled onto his front, to see if that would help. No, his face was all squashed in his pillow that way. He rolled on his side, but this made his hip hurt. The other side made his ear too hot. He groaned under his breath.\n\u201cOi, Moony,\u201d Sirius whispered, as the curtains parted, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He crawled inside silently, with a quick\nlumos\nand a silencing spell. He knelt at the end of the bed, looking at Remus.\n\u201cSorry, did I wake you up?\u201d Remus squinted at the unnecessary brightness.\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s ok.\u201d Sirius shifted and plonked himself down next to Remus.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Remus twisted his mouth, embarrassed, \u201cLook, I\u2019m not really in the mood for\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, no, me neither! I mean\u2026 well, actually, now you mention it\u2026 but no, not why I came over.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s up?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t sleep.\u201d\n\u201cI can tell. Want a fag?\u201d\n\u201cRun out.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, I\u2019ve got some off Emmeline. C\u2019mon, shall we go downstairs? It's late, no one\u2019ll be there and Prongs\u2019ll give us shit if we smoke here.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d Remus pretended to go reluctantly. Secretly he was thrilled that:\n\nSirius was worried about him, and;\n\nSirius wanted to spend time alone with him without waking up James.\n\nThe fact that the offered cigarettes came from Sirius\u2019s current girlfriend was a fact Remus was willing to overlook for now. Downstairs, they settled by the window, on the little loveseat there. Both drew their knees up and sat facing each other, so that if Remus stretched just a little their toes would touch.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Sirius sucked in, lighting a cigarette wordlessly then passing it to Remus, before lighting his own. It was probably something that impressed girls. It impressed Remus too, but he wasn't going to show it. \u201cWhat's the plan?\u201d\n\u201cPlan?\u201d Remus frowned.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been up all night for the past three nights and you haven\u2019t got a plan?! Are you sure you\u2019re Moony??\u201d\n\u201cI want to go back to The Hog\u2019s Head.\u201d Remus said, promptly.\nSirius let his eyes flicker, but took this news in slowly. He exhaled smoke, looking out of the dark window at the waning moon above them before returning to Remus to speak.\n\u201cRight. Ok, I think I can understand why.\u201d He took a hard drag on his cigarette, \u201cInvisible?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus shook his head, taking short, nervous pulls on his fag, \u201cNo, if they\u2019re there \u2013 if\nshe\u2019s\nthere, then I want to meet her.\u201d\n\u201cRemus. No.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Remus shot back, hotly. He was ready for a fight, if Sirius wanted one. That would feel good; that would be\nsomething.\n\u201cBecause it's dangerous?! Because you\u2019ve never met them before and you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re like except that they\nmurdered\na woman the other night?! Because you\u2019re not even seventeen yet and if you have to defend yourself with magic you could get kicked out of school??\u201d\nSirius was staring at him as he said all of this, incredulous. Remus blinked in shock. He stubbed out his cigarette and stood up, using his height against Sirius,\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what to do. Just don\u2019t get in my way.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that! Look, I understand how you feel--\u201d\n\u201cHa.\u201d\n\u201cOk, I don\u2019t\nunderstand\n,\u201d Sirius shook his head impatiently, \u201cbut I want you to be safe!\u201d\n\u201cI will be - it\u2019s ages until the next full moon, she won\u2019t have any advantage over me--\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think this is exactly what Greyback\nwants\n?!\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Remus growled. \u201cThat I\u2019m being stupid?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not stupid, just\u2026 reckless.\u201d\n\u201cSirius Black, lecturing me on recklessness? Very bloody funny, that.\u201d\n\u201cOi.\u201d Sirius stood up now, angry.\nYes, here we go,\nsomething in Remus said,\ngo on, try it.\n\u201cWell it\u2019s pretty rich of\nyou\nto tell\nme\nnot to put myself in danger.\u201d Remus continued, knowing he was being cruel, \u201cYou weren\u2019t so concerned about my safety this time last year!\u201d\nSirius\u2019s face fell, he looked down at the carpet and Remus saw what he had done.\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s not fair, Moony.\u201d Sirius said, quietly.\nLife\u2019s not fair\n, Remus wanted to say - but he knew how childish and petulant that would sound. This wasn\u2019t an argument either of them was going to win, and he was tired, so exhausted from worrying and thinking and imagining and\nnot sleeping\n.\n\u201cI have to meet them.\u201d He said, finally. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go mad otherwise. I think I\u2019m already going mad.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d Sirius recovered, and ran his hand through his hair. \u201cOk, what about Ferox, have you tried talking to him?\u201d\n\u201cThought about it. He\u2019ll try to stop me. Moody too. It\u2019s their idea not to let me go to Hogsmeade in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cAll right\u2026 all right, we\u2019ll go, ok? Together. We\u2019ll tell James, and--\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone else to know.\u201d Remus said, fiercely, \u201cIt\u2019s private.\u201d\n\u201cMerlin, Moony, you\u2019re not making this easy--\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nnot\neasy! It\u2019s fucking difficult, ok, but I have to do it!\u201d\n\u201cOk!\u201d Sirius raised both hands in a peace-making gesture.\nWe\u2019re fighting,\nRemus thought,\nwe\u2019re fighting and\nhe\u2019s\nthe one trying to calm\nme\ndown.\nThat made him feel a bit dizzy, and he sat down on the nearest sofa. He leaned forward, head in his hands.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, in a small voice, \u201cI know I\u2019m being\u2026 it\u2019s just all so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI do understand, Moony.\u201d Sirius sat next to him. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t help,\u201d Remus said, \u201cI have to do this on my own, I can\u2019t risk anyone else, it has to be me, I have to\u2026\u201d Remus began talking, and it all came out in a jumble of sleep-deprived babble. \u201cIf I can meet her, then maybe\u2026 I have to meet Greyback, one day. I just know I have to. And I want to - not to join him, or anything like that, just to - to know him. And to understand. Why he did what he did and why\u2026 why he made me who I am.\u201d\nTears had sprung out of nowhere, and he covered his face, ashamed. Sirius was quiet beside him.\n\u201cMoony\u2026\u201d he laid a cool, tentative hand on Remus\u2019s shoulder, lightly, as if Remus might spin around and snap at him like a wild animal, \u201cHe didn\u2019t make you who you are.\u201d\n\u201cHe made me\nwhat\nI am.\u201d Oh god, he was sobbing, now. He wished he hadn\u2019t started this whole conversation, wished he\u2019d just sent Sirius back to bed.\nThe last time he\u2019d cried had been a similar situation - he had been sitting next to a boy he loved, saying something which hurt to say. Grant had held him, and made him feel like everything would be all right. Remus knew he had no right to expect the same from Sirius.\nAs Remus\u2019s shoulders began to shake with emotion, Sirius moved slightly, but he didn\u2019t go anywhere. Remus heard him give a strange little noise \u2013 which might have been sympathetic, or just confused, but he shifted closer and slid his hand down into Remus\u2019s and squeezed his fingers. Pathetically, Remus squeezed back as he wept angrily about Greyback, and the poor murdered woman, and the dreadful unfairness of everything.\n* * *\nSaturday 15th January 1977\nRemus woke up at dawn, still curled up on the couch, covered in a woollen blanket from the dresser kept in the corner of the common room. He frowned against the sunlight, blinking and confused while he slowly remembered where he was. Sirius was still there, at the other end, sitting up with his head lolling back in sleep, mouth open.\nOf course\nSirius didn\u2019t snore.\nRemus wished he could watch him for a bit longer in the dim early light, but he had been scrunched up all night and desperately needed to stretch. He moved carefully, his stiff limbs creaking like the branches of an ancient yew. Sirius stirred, coughed lightly and opened his eyes.\n\u201cMorning,\u201d he grunted, straightening up. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\n\u201cNearly seven.\u201d Remus replied, after a quick glance at the grandfather clock.\n\u201cJames\u2019ll be up for quidditch in a minute.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cYou ok?\u201d\nRemus set his bare feet down on the carpet and rubbed the pins and needles out of his left leg.\n\u201cI slept, at least.\u201d He replied. \u201cSorry for last night.\u201d\n\u201cPff.\u201d Sirius waved his hand, yawning, \u201cIt was nothing. I\u2019ve had much worse meltdowns.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you two tossers doing down here at this hour?\u201d James came bounding down the stairs, broom in hand. He looked at them both, took in their pyjamas and Remus\u2019s blanket. \u201cDid you\nsleep\nhere?\u201d\n\u201cHad to,\u201d Sirius replied, stretching, \u201cAnything to get away from your snoring.\u201d\nJames grinned, shaking his head.\n\u201cWeirdos. Don\u2019t fancy joining me for a quick go around the pitch before practice, Padfoot?\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d Sirius yawned again, \u201cI\u2019m going back to bed. It\u2019s Saturday, Potter, you lunatic.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Hogsmeade, later, don\u2019t oversleep.\u201d James warned, \u201cSorry, Moony.\u201d He gave an apologetic glance.\n\u201cS\u2019ok,\u201d Remus replied, \u201cYou lot go and have fun. I\u2019ve got homework. Obviously. The common room will be nice and quiet.\u201d\n\u201cSee you both for breakfast, then?\u201d James asked, halfway out of the room already, eager to be the first on the pitch.\nThe common room would start filling up, soon - the Gryffindor quidditch team first, then some of the keener students looking to get their homework out of the way before the trip into the village scheduled for later. Remus looked at Sirius,\n\u201cAre you really going back to bed?\u201d\nSirius raised an eyebrow.\n\u201cYeah. Want to come?\u201d\nFor the first time in days, Remus laughed.\n* * *\n\u201cHi Remus, can I sit here?\u201d\nRemus looked up with a small frown that had more to do with a complex Astronomy chart than being interrupted. He smiled as soon as he saw who it was, and nodded,\n\u201cOf course, Chris, take your pick.\u201d He motioned to the five empty chairs at the table he was using. Christopher sat just one seat away from Remus. \u201cDidn\u2019t fancy Hogsmeade?\u201d\n\u201cOh, well, I knew\nyou\ncouldn\u2019t go, and I\u2019m behind on a few things, so\u2026\u201d Christopher looked slightly nervous. He sat with his notebooks and parchment clutched in his lap, eyeing Remus shiftily.\n\u201cEr\u2026 did you want to get your work out?\u201d Remus prompted, vaguely amused.\n\u201cYeah! Sorry\u2026\u201d Christopher quickly started spreading out his notes, awkwardly, blushing fiercely.\n\u201cYou ok, Chris?\u201d\n\u201cMm hmm, yep\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOk. Well, I\u2019m doing Astronomy and making a proper mess of it. You\u2019re quite good at stars and stuff, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I mean not brilliant. But ok, yeah, er\u2026 want me to look?\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Remus slid over his chart.\n\u201cOh right, I can see where you\u2019ve gone wrong, you\u2019re a few degrees out\u2026\u201d Christopher pulled out his compass and began plotting a new trajectory for Venus. Remus was quite happy to let him get on with it, and started flicking through his planner. He had History to do, but had perversely planned to save it for last as a treat. He could probably tell Christopher that to lighten the mood; it was the sort of thing Chris did too. Sirius would only shake his head in bafflement and call him a swot.\nHe was just about to say something, when Christopher beat him to it.\n\u201cI started reading some muggle books.\u201d He said, in a rush, as if he had been building up to it for a while. \u201cOver Christmas.\u201d\n\u201cDid you?\u201d Remus smiled, politely. He\u2019d been telling Christopher for ages that he was limiting himself by not reading books by non-magical authors. \u201cHow\u2019d you get on?\u201d\n\u201cYeah! It\u2019s been great. I like poetry best\u2026\u201d It was a fairly innocuous statement, but Christopher looked as though he was spilling his very darkest secret. His cheeks were crimson now, and he wasn\u2019t looking at Remus when he spoke. \u201cI er\u2026 I like Oscar Wilde, a lot.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Remus replied, steadily, wondering where this was going.\nHe thought he had a pretty good idea what Christopher was getting at, actually, but he needed to stall for time while he worked out how to react. Surely they weren\u2019t going to talk about this\nhere\nand\nnow\n, at three o\u2019clock on a Saturday in an only half empty common room? There were first years playing gobstones on the carpet, for goodness sake!\n\u201cYes, and\u2026 and Christopher Isherwood.\u201d Chris continued, valiantly. It\nwas\nbrave, Remus decided. It was maybe the bravest thing he had ever witnessed.\n\u201cRight, yeah\u2026\u201d He cleared his throat, wishing he knew the right way to respond. \u201cYou might like Truman Capote, too.\u201d\nChristopher looked at him, half eager, half afraid.\n\u201cThey\u2019re er\u2026 they\u2019re\nyour sort\nof writers too, then?\u201d Christopher was gnawing his lip very hard now, Remus was worried he would bit through the skin.\n\u201cUm\u2026 yeah.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t know how he felt about it really. He\u2019d had an inkling \u2013 more than an inkling \u2013 about Christopher for quite some time. But he hadn\u2019t expected this in a million years. Christopher looked incredibly relieved, and leaned in,\n\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d He whispered.\nRemus leaned back, panicking over who might be listening. He glanced around quickly, then rubbed the back of his head.\n\u201cChrist.\u201d He breathed, \u201cI\nreally\nneed a cigarette. Want to go for a walk?\u201d\nThis was perhaps the worst possible time to talk about this. But that wasn\u2019t Christopher\u2019s fault. Christopher didn\u2019t know about the werewolf situation, or Greyback, or Sirius\u2019s nonsensical attitude to sexuality, or even that the marauders were planning to go to war in just a year\u2019s time. Christopher only knew one thing, and Remus knew that he needed a friend.\nThey went to the Astronomy Tower, knowing it was likely to be empty \u2013 all of the couples were in Hogsmeade today. They sat outside, backs against the parapet, and Remus smoked and Christopher twisted his hands in his lap.\n\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d He asked again.\n\u201cSince I was fifteen.\u201d Remus replied. \u201cSummer before last. You?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 I think I sort of always had an idea. But. Yeah, maybe only for a few months.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be ok, you know.\u201d Remus said, hoping he sounded believable. It wasn\u2019t\nexactly\na lie - but he didn\u2019t know for sure.\n\u201cDo the other marauders know? About you?\u201d\nRemus flinched, remembering the heat of Sirius\u2019s skin against him from earlier that morning. How he had held his hand as he cried. How he had left breakfast early to meet Emmeline. He shook his head,\n\u201cNah. Not yet.\u201d\n\u201cNone of my friends know. You\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve told.\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t know what to say about that. Not everybody had a Grant, he supposed. He half laughed, half sighed.\n\u201cSorry, Chris. Wish I had some advice or something, but I\u2019m just muddling through.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s ok. It\u2019s just good to know there\u2019s someone else\u2026 is it like this with muggles?\u201d\n\u201cHm? Oh, well\u2026 I mean there\nare\nqueer muggles, yeah. Obviously, Oscar Wilde and that. They used to be able to send you to prison, but it\u2019s ok now. Well. Not ok. It\u2019s not\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s still better\nnot\nto be queer, I suppose. What about with wizards?\u201d\n\u201cSame,\u201d Christopher replied, glumly, \u201cBetter not to be.\u201d\nThey were quiet for a bit. Remus started another cigarette. It was becoming a dreadful habit; he struggled to climb the stairs any more without wheezing.\n\u201cRemus?\u201d Christopher said.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad\u2026 er, I\u2019m glad that if there was anyone else who\u2026 knew\u2026 then I\u2019m glad it\u2019s you.\u201d\nGod\n. Remus thought,\nwhy\u2019d you have to be so bloody sweet?\n* * *\nAll in all, it had been a very busy Saturday. And it wasn\u2019t over yet, Remus told himself as he lay in the dark, still as possible, waiting for his friends\u2019 breathing to level out, to tell him they were all asleep. He was keeping still and quiet to try and trick Sirius - he couldn\u2019t afford an interruption tonight. He had places to be.\nYes, ok; he had told Sirius he wouldn\u2019t go to The Hog\u2019s Head. Or at least that he wouldn\u2019t go without him. But, Remus justified to himself, this was too important, and he had to go alone. He couldn\u2019t be responsible for putting any more people in danger than he already had. And, actually, he thought, grumpily, as he began to creep out of the room, James\u2019s cloak stuffed under his robes, who was\nSirius\nto demand anything from Remus? Tossing each other off every now and then clearly didn\u2019t mean they had any special claim on each other. Sirius couldn\u2019t have everything his way.\nHe covered himself with the invisibility cloak in the darkness of the stairway, and then stole quietly through the half empty common room and out of the portrait hole. He had the map and he had his wand, and nothing else.\nSooner than he had expected, Remus found himself already outside the statue of the humpbacked witch, and then he was in the tunnel, walking at a speed he rarely managed. He didn\u2019t need to light his wand, as he usually did when the others were with him. He just ploughed on through the cold air, the smell of chocolate was getting stronger by the minute and it had never been less appetising.\nIn Honeyduke\u2019s, he was able to get through to the front of the shop with little trouble, though he had a hairpin he\u2019d pinched off Mary just in case. And all of a sudden, he was there; standing alone in Hogsmeade. He kept going, it was the only option. He could smell her already, she was still there, or had been recently. Remus\u2019s heart began to pound. He was more frightened than he ever had been in his life \u2013 more frightened than he had been last year, waking up to find out what Sirius had done.\nOutside The Hog\u2019s Head he finally stopped for breath. The scent was very strong now. Light glowed through the dirty pub windows, and Remus could see that it was not busy inside, though there were customers. He pulled back the cloak, breathing in the chill January air.\nThere was movement behind him; a noise like a gasp of delight.\n\u201cThere you are! Who\u2019s a pretty boy, then?\u201d"

            "content": "She was not what he had expected. Well, he had not known what to expect - but it was certainly not this. She was small bodied, but had the bearing of someone much taller. Her sharp angular features were made more severe by her shaved head and huge fog grey eyes which focussed on him with a predator\u2019s glint. She had a wide mouth, and her lip had been split at some point, and healed badly. She had scars too; as many as he did, but almost invisible under a complex lacework of small circular tattoos, spiralling across her weatherbeaten skin in untraceable sequences.\n\u201cRemus Lupin,\u201d she said, in a low, gravelly voice. She had a horrible, menacing smile. She showed all of her teeth - which were in bad condition, discoloured and uneven. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you, my dear.\u201d\nHe pulled out his wand at once, adopting a duelling stance.\n\u201cDrop that!\u201d She snarled, raising a hand - her nails were long, yellow and clawed, filthy with dirt.\nHis wand clattered to the ground, and he gasped. Remus was frozen to the spot. She stood only meters away, and his wand was within reach, but he couldn\u2019t move a muscle. She laughed, her breath stark and white in the winter air, \u201cI saw you here on Christmas Eve,\u201d she said. She pointed to the dark alley, \u201cI saw you there, with the human. I followed you both.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d He asked, steadily, staring her down. She was repulsive, unclean - her cloak was heavy matted animal fur, crawling with lice and other vermin. She stank of the forest, and rot, and blood. Despite this, something drew him in - something familiar, safe and welcoming.\nPack\n, the wolf told him, a low growl from somewhere inside.\nPack.\n\u201cWe want\nyou\n, brother.\u201d She said, stepping forward.\nShe lowered her hand, and he felt a sort of un-clicking in his muscles, and stepped back, automatically.\n\u201cWe?\u201d He asked, finding courage now that he could move again. He snatched up his wand and she allowed it.\n\u201cWe. Us.\u201d She said, stepping forward again. She walked with one foot in front of the other, like an animal. Her feet were bare on the cobbles, black with filth.\n\u201cWho\u2019s \u2018us\u2019?\u201d He asked, glancing back, quickly. He was almost at the door. If he backed away far enough, he\u2019d be visible from inside the pub windows.\n\u201cYour family, Remus Lupin.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right?\u201d He asked, still distracted by his progress towards the pub. He had to get closer to\npeople\n. \u201cWell,\u201d he tried smiling, \u201cIf we\u2019re family, I\u2019d better buy you a drink\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou reek of human terror, Remus Lupin.\u201d She said, tilting her head to one side.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, with a shrug. \u201cDo you want a drink, or not?\u201d\n\u201cIf it pleases you.\u201d\n\u201cGreat\u2026\u201d he pushed open the door with some relief, and stepped into the grimy pub. He had never really felt \u2018safe\u2019 in The Hog\u2019s Head, but he had never been quite so glad to be surrounded by other wizards; dark or not. There were maybe five or six of them, including the old white-bearded barman. A few patrons glanced up from under their hoods as the two werewolves entered - but if they had any clue about the situation, they made no sign of it.\nShe sat at a table, not taking her eyes off Remus for a moment. He didn\u2019t order drinks, just sat opposite her. He placed both hands on the table, feeling that this was the safest option; hoping that she would see he was not planning to attack.\n\u201cSo. You know my name. What\u2019s yours?\u201d He didn\u2019t know where this cavalier attitude had come from - whether it was a momentary madness or just the outcome of his own stupidity, but it was keeping him safe for now.\n\u201cLivia.\u201d\n\u201cLivia\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cWe do not need other names. We belong to the pack.\u201d\n\u201cRight, ok. So\u2026 you were sent by the pack?\u201d\n\u201cI was sent by my father.\u201d\n\u201cGreyback.\u201d\nShe did not reply, she just kept staring at him with her strange, violent eyes. She did not belong indoors, he felt. The train of her cloak was caked in mud, and dirt smeared the parts of her skin that were visible. Up close, he could see that her tattoos were not simply circles - they were moon phases. \u201cIs Greyback really your father?\u201d Remus asked, keeping his voice low.\n\u201cHe is our father.\u201d She said.\n\u201cOrder or leave.\u201d The tall, ancient bar man appeared by their side. Remus looked up at him, wishing he knew how to transmit thoughts.\n\u201cEr\u2026 butterbeer, please.\u201d\nLivia did not say anything, and the barman did not question her, only snapped his fingers, and the bottle appeared. He shuffled away, back behind his bar. Remus wiped the rim of the bottle cautiously, and took a sip. It was much too sickly, and not cold enough. \u201cOk,\u201d he said to Livia again, \u201cYou\u2019re in Greyback\u2019s pack. That er\u2026 must be nice? Do you--\u201d\n\u201cI called for you, Remus Lupin.\u201d Livia interrupted, settling back in her chair. Remus was convinced that he had not yet seen her blink. \u201cI heard you calling for me, you sang so beautifully.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean on the moon\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI waited as long as I could, but the hunt was too good and I was hungry\u2026\u201d her eyes gleamed brightly, as if the memory was still very fresh, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come to me? They did not lock you up; I followed your scent for days afterwards.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a killer.\u201d He said. \u201cI don\u2019t hunt.\u201d\nShe laughed,\n\u201cMadness. What have they done to you, my poor brother? Father told me you had suffered at the human\u2019s hands, but I did not know how much.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t suffer.\u201d Remus replied, indignantly. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky. They take care of me.\u201d\n\u201cPoor boy,\u201d she said sadly, \u201cYou do not know. But of course, that is not your fault.\n\u2018How could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads?\u2019\n\u201d\n\u201cPlato?\u201d Remus sat up, curious, \u201cGreyback lets you study muggle philosophy?\u201d\n\u201cMy father places no limitations on me. My father wishes me to be free and strong and wise.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a murderer.\u201d\n\u201cWolves cannot murder. You know this, Remus Lupin.\u201d\n\u201cBut we aren\u2019t wolves, are we?\u201d He whispered. \u201cNot all the time.\u201d\n\u201cWe are what we are.\u201d She replied. She was enjoying this, he could tell. \u201cYou can wear that uniform and wave your silly stick, but you know that you have more in common with me than anyone in that castle.\u201d She licked her lips, \u201cI have come to bring you home, Remus Lupin.\u201d\n\u201cWhy now?\u201d\n\u201cThe time is right,\u201d She cocked her head, \u201cFather prefers to wait until we are of age - so that we come to him with a true understanding of our place in the world; the place the human filth have forced on us. But time is short for us all, these days.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going with you.\u201d He said. \u201cI belong here. I\u2019m a wizard.\u201d\nShe laughed again, a throaty, deep laugh that rattled in her chest and spoke of long cold winters in hard, unforgiving environments.\n\u201cA wizard,\u201d she spat, ruefully. \u201cTo think that a magnificent beast like you would aspire to be such a creature! You don\u2019t know half of the power you hold, Remus Lupin. Nor does Dumbledore.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m still not going anywhere.\u201d\n\u201cFather suspected you would be difficult. He is very eager to meet you.\u201d\nThat sent a chill down Remus\u2019s spine. She smiled again, reading him like a book. Remus swallowed, dryly, ignoring the butterbeer now,\n\u201cI\u2019d like to meet him.\u201d He replied, stiffly.\n\u201cIn time,\u201d she nodded, \u201cOnce you have come to understand your place.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he like?\u201d Remus barely breathed the question. Livia\u2019s eyes shone, and he had the impression that she could not see him; she was imagining something wonderful.\n\u201cHe is magnificent.\u201d\n\u201cYou think that\u2026?!\u201d Remus could hardly keep the emotion from his voice, \u201cYou call him your father, after what he did to you?\u201d\n\u201cHe elevated me.\u201d She hissed, her eyes focussing again, eyebrows knitting into a frown, \u201cHe gave me the greatest gift. And he gave it to you, Remus Lupin. Your father is calling you home.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what you\u2019re here for, is it?\u201d He looked her up and down. She gave a small shrug,\n\u201cMy father had hoped that I might be the right one to persuade you. I learnt on Christmas Eve that he was mistaken \u2013 we did not know that your desires lay elsewhere.\u201d She licked her lips again, her eyes raking over him, \u201cThis will not be a problem, I should let you know. The pack does not discriminate. You will find someone to your taste.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d He repeated. \u201cYou can tell him that. And I want\nyou\ngone before the next moon.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself, my dear brother,\u201d she arched an eyebrow, \u201cI am here at my father\u2019s request. I came to speak with you, and nothing more.\u201d\n\u201cYou murdered a woman!\u201d\n\u201cWolves cannot murder, Remus Lupin. I waited for you. When you did not come, I followed my nature. It is not easy, I know. Learning that the world is not as it seems is very painful. But you will learn. And you will come to us.\u201d\nShe tapped out a rhythm on the beer soaked table with her disgusting fingernails, and once again Remus found himself frozen in place. She smiled, and ran a blackened talon across his arm, slowly. It was hideous, vile, revolting, raising goosebumps in his flesh, but he couldn\u2019t get away.\n\u201cThey will trap you, like this,\u201d she whispered, \u201cThey will cage you, shackle you and tie you down until you are half mad with hunger. You will be beaten and betrayed. You will be alone and you will live in fear. This is a promise, Remus Lupin.\u201d\nHis heart was hammering against his ribcage, he was giddy with terror, but still he could not move, or speak, or react. She dug her nails into his arm, and he could not cry out, but tears of pain welled in his eyes as beads of dark blood bubbled up through his broken skin. \u201cAnd you will come to us, crawling, defeated, and your father will welcome you with open arms and the love of the pack. You will never be lonely again.\u201d\n*CRACK*\nSomeone apparated into the pub, catching Livia\u2019s attention. Remus couldn\u2019t turn his head to see, but she did, still gripping Remus\u2019s arm with all her strength, her face turned sour and angry.\n\u201c\nArgentum creo\n!\u201d A gruff voice shouted, and Livia shrieked, letting go of Remus and covering her face as silver chains burst forth from the incantation, coiling themselves around her neck and arms. Groaning in pain, she hissed at Remus,\n\u201cI will see you soon, brother!\u201d Before apparating herself, with a blistering *CRACK*.\nThe silver chains fell to the saw dust covered floor like a glistening snake, and Remus slumped forward, finally free. He turned away from his rescuer and threw up, his arm throbbing and the silver making his head swim.\n\u201c\nFinite.\n\u201d The same gruff voice said, making the chains (and the vomit) disappear in an instant, \u201cSorry about that, Remus.\u201d\nLeo Ferox sat down in the seat opposite, where Livia had been only seconds before. Remus blinked at him through watering eyes, and shook his head, wiping his mouth quickly,\n\u201cS\u2019ok\u2026\u201d he croaked, feeling weak and shaken to the core. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Ferox asked, his blue eyes filled with parental concern.\n\u201cI think so, it\u2019s just the silver\u2026\u201d Remus nodded, clutching his arm, and taking a quick swig of butterbeer to clear the bitter taste in his mouth. \u201cYeah.\u201d He nodded again.\n\u201cGood.\u201d Ferox\u2019s face turned stern. He reached across the table and slapped Remus around the back of the head. Remus yelped and ducked, more out of shock than pain. He stared at Ferox, wounded. His old teacher glared back at him, \u201cThen you can tell me what the bloody hell you think you\u2019re doing!\u201d\n\u201cI was\u2026 she was\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know exactly what she was. We\u2019ve been tracking her for weeks.\u201d\n\u201cWe?\u201d\n\u201cMe and Moody,\u201d Ferox said, impatiently, as if this was not the point, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you how dangerous Greyback was? Was I not clear!?\u201d\n\u201cYou were clear.\u201d Remus scowled. \u201cBut I can make my own choices.\u201d\n\u201cObviously.\u201d Ferox growled.\nThe tall, white bearded barman appeared at Ferox\u2019s shoulder, with a tumbler of firewhisky. Ferox accepted it, and downed it in one. \u201cThanks, Aberforth,\u201d he nodded to the barman, who nodded and shuffled away again. Ferox shook his head, still angry, \u201cYou\u2019re lucky he saw you. You\u2019re lucky he knew enough to contact Moody before he contacted anyone else!\u201d\n\u201cWhy, who is he?\u201d Remus turned to look.\n\u201cIt doesn't matter.\u201d Ferox snapped, drawing Remus\u2019s attention back. \u201cBut you\u2019re damned lucky.\u201d\n\u201cOk, ok!\u201d Remus looked at his hands. His arm had stopped bleeding, but it was stinging very unpleasantly. Who knew what kind of muck she\u2019d had under her nails. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good enough, Remus!\u201d Ferox sighed, deeply. \u201cYou were stupid, and careless, and you could have been killed! Do you know what they want? Do you know why she was waiting for you?!\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d He replied, churlishly, folding his arms, careful not to bump the one that hurt, \u201cShe told me.\u201d\nFerox huffed, furiously,\n\u201cThey want to make you one of them!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m already one of them!\u201d Remus shouted, standing up so fast his stool flew backwards, clattering on the dirty pub floor and attracting everyone\u2019s attention. Remus didn\u2019t care. He started for the door. Ferox followed him outside. Remus walked faster, heading for Honeyduke\u2019s, \u201cYou\u2019re not my dad. You\u2019re not even my teacher anymore, so piss off and leave me alone!\u201d\nHis terror had turned to rage so quickly, his head still throbbing from the silver, and from being slapped (\njust like bloody Matron, bloody adults are all the bloody same\n), his arm hurting and itching more than ever. And Remus was not quick on his feet at the best of times. Ferox caught up easily. He grabbed his shoulder,\n\u201cOi! Look, maybe I was a bit harsh, but\u2026\nJesus christ\n, Lupin! You gave us all such a fright.\u201d\nRemus stopped at that,\n\u201cAll?\u201d\nFerox sighed again.\n\u201cCome on. I\u2019d better take you back to the castle. There are some people waiting for you.\u201d\nBefore they began to walk back, Ferox cast a patronus, a huge, long legged bird, to send a message up to Hogwarts that they were both safe.\n\u201cDumbledore knows, then.\u201d Remus sighed.\n\u201c\u2018Fraid so.\u201d\n\u201cAnd McGonagall, I s\u2019pose.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at a lot of detention, Remus, I won\u2019t lie to you.\u201d\nRemus snorted, and looked up at Ferox properly for the first time. Actually - he didn\u2019t have to look up. In the two years since they had last met, Remus had caught up in height. They were eye to eye. Ferox was still golden haired, ruggedly handsome and weather beaten, but he was no longer the hero Remus had worshipped at thirteen. He was just a man \u2013 a soldier in a war, like all of them.\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d Remus said, \u201cI knew it was stupid, I can\u2019t even explain myself.\u201d\n\u201cAh, you don\u2019t have to, lad,\u201d Ferox clapped a hand to his shoulder, \u201cIt\u2019s only natural, knowing what you know about him.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met another\u2026 werewolf\u2026 before.\u201d He said. \u201cAre they all like that?\u201d\nFerox glanced at him sideways,\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\nRemus thought about this while they walked, and eventually shook his head.\n\u201cNo, I suppose they can\u2019t be.\u201d He sighed, \u201cThere are good and bad people. Good and bad wizards. Why should monsters be any different?\u201d\n\u201cRemus me old pal, if you could get everyone else to understand that then I don\u2019t think there would be a war on.\u201d\n* * *\nHe was brought straight to Dumbledore\u2019s office. Remus had never been inside it before, and it was almost as anxiety inducing as meeting Livia. It was a high ceilinged airy room with portraits covering the walls and cabinets full of strange curiosities. Terrifyingly, Dumbledore was alone, sitting at his desk, writing on a long piece of parchment. Remus stood in silence for at least five minutes.\n\u201cMr Lupin.\u201d The headmaster said, finally. \u201cWe seem always to meet under the most unpleasant conditions.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Fair enough.\u201d Remus nodded. He\u2019d had too much of a night to care much about what Dumbledore had to say.\nI said I\u2019d fight for your bloody cause, old man, what more do you want?\nDumbledore watched his nonchalance carefully.\n\u201cYou have done a very dangerous thing, tonight.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he raised his bandaged arm.\n\u201cYou know that is not what I am referring to.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Remus replied, hanging his head, trying to look remorseful. If he hadn\u2019t had the chance to cool off with Ferox, then he might have a lot more to say.\nI know, professor, you aren\u2019t referring to any bodily harm I might have come to. That is clearly the least of your concerns, considering I had been tearing myself apart for eight years before anyone decided to intervene.\nDumbledore, of course, didn\u2019t know about the marauder\u2019s secret. He may well have known about Madam Pomfrey\u2019s efforts to help Remus, but if he did, he showed no interest.\nSo Remus shut up and took his punishment, hoping that eventually Dumbledore would release him and he could just go back to bed. There was a lecture on responsibility and maturity. A stern reminder that the war is bigger than him, and that his own personal motives did not matter. \u201cWe all have to make sacrifices\u2026\u201d (\nyeah,\nRemus scoffed, inwardly,\nsome more than others, presumably.\n)\n\u201cDo you understand, Remus?\u201d\n\u201cYes, headmaster.\u201d\nAfter that, he had to give Dumbledore a detailed account of everything he and Livia had discussed. It wasn\u2019t much \u2013 Remus couldn\u2019t help feeling a little bit disappointed by how little he had learnt himself. Dumbledore seemed pleased, however \u2013 as much as Dumbledore ever seemed to be one thing or another. Several of the clocks in one of the glass cabinets began to chime, and Remus realised that it was three o\u2019clock in the morning. He stifled a yawn.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Dumbledore nodded, as if Remus had just made a very interesting point, \u201cPerhaps that is enough for tonight. You may go to bed, Mr Lupin.\u201d\nRemus nodded dozily and stood up, rubbing his hip which was stiff from sitting on hard wooden seats all evening.\n\u201cProfessor?\u201d He asked, just before leaving. Dumbledore had returned to his letter writing, and made no sign he had heard the boy, so Remus just continued anyway, \u201cLivia said that I didn\u2019t know half the power I had. And she could do wandless magic, and wordless magic, and\u2014\u201c\n\u201cHer talents were nothing out of the ordinary, Mr Lupin,\u201d Dumbledore replied, not looking up, \u201cShe has clearly studied the dark arts, and may be particularly gifted. Do not dwell on it.\u201d\n\u201cOk then.\u201d Remus replied, even more disappointed. \u201cIs er\u2026 is Professor Ferox still here?\u201d\n\u201cMr Ferox is staying in Hogsmeade for a few more days. Good night, Remus.\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 goodnight, headmaster.\u201d\nProfessor McGonagall was waiting for him outside the office. She looked furious, but she didn\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had enough of a telling off for one night.\u201d She said, stiffly.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Remus sighed, \u201cI can take a bit more, if it\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d\nShe raised an eyebrow at him, tutted, but kept walking. When they arrived at the portrait hole, she stopped and said,\n\u201cTwo month\u2019s detention, every night except full moons. And tell those boys to get to bed at once.\u201d\nHe crawled through to the common room and found James, Sirius and Peter there, waiting in their pyjamas. James was pacing by the fireplace, Peter was trying not to fall sleep, leaning on his elbow, and Sirius, who had been sitting bolt upright in an armchair, leapt to his feet the moment he saw Remus.\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re playing at?!\u201d He shouted, striding across the room, \u201cRunning off on your own!\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t, Padfoot, I\u2019m knackered\u2026\u201d Remus sighed, wincing. He was getting a headache. He just wanted to go to sleep \u2013 enough talking tonight.\n\u201cDo you have\nany idea\nwhat it was like finding out you\u2019d sneaked off?!\u201d Sirius shouted. Remus raised an eyebrow at him.\nSirius blinked, and stepped back, slightly, looking down. \u201cFor all of us, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cI can imagine.\u201d Remus said, \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry, but please can I just go to bed? You can have a go at me in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, back off, Black.\u201d James came over, and placed a hand on Sirius\u2019s shoulder. Sirius shrugged it off, agitated. James sighed, taking his glasses off. \u201cIt\u2019s late, we\u2019re all tired. You sure you\u2019re ok, Moony?\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Remus nodded, so, so grateful to James Potter."

            "content": "Sunday 15\nth\nJanuary 1977\nHe slept as late as possible the next morning, to put off further confrontation. He couldn't talk to them, not yet, not until his head was straight. They\u2019d have so many questions \u2013 some he couldn\u2019t answer, some he didn\u2019t want to. He showered for longer than usual \u2013 something of Livia seemed to cling to him, and he turned the tap right up, trying to scald it off. The claw marks she had left were healing already, but still itched under Remus\u2019s scratchy wool jumper.\nWashed and dressed, Remus went to his trunk and looked for a spare bit of parchment, before scrawling an untidy note:\n\nIf you\u2019re still in the village, I\u2019d like to talk to you again.\n\nHe folded it in a hurry, shoved it in his pocket and headed for the owlery. The marauders were all in the common room, in much the same state as they had been\u00a0the night before. Remus looked at them, panicked, then bent his head and kept walking.\n\u201cMoony, wait\u2026\u201d they followed him, all three, through the portrait hole. No matter, they couldn\u2019t discuss it in the open, he knew this and they knew it.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to the owlery.\u201d He said, marching ahead.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want breakfast?\u201d Peter asked.\n\u201cAfter.\u201d\n\u201cMoony, can we talk about what happened last night?\u201d James asked, sounding very tired still. Remus supposed he\u2019d been bearing the brunt of Sirius\u2019s frustration.\nGood; let someone else do that for a bit.\n\u201cNot here.\u201d\nUnfortunately, they all followed him to the owlery \u2013 which happened to be completely empty \u2013 except for owls, of course, most of which were sleeping.\n\u201cWho are you writing to?\u201d Sirius asked at once. Remus closed his eyes, sighed, and resumed tying his note to the nearest owl.\n\u201cFerox. My old professor.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?!\u201d\nRemus dropped the string he was using and tutted as he had to bend to pick it up. He continued to explain, calmly.\n\u201cHe\u2019s in Hogsmeade. I saw him last night, but I want to see him again.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was he doing in--\u201d\nRemus tutted again, fumbling with his third attempt to tie the note to the agitated owl\u2019s leg. Sirius was standing much too close, leaning over him, demanding answers, and Remus could barely concentrate.\n\u201cHe\u2019s working with Moody, and he got summoned there to bring me back--\u201d\n\u201cSummoned by who?\u201d\n\u201cFucking hell, give me a minute, will you?!\u201d Remus snapped.\nSirius stood back, looking as if he\u2019d very much like to say something else, but was biting his tongue. James touched his shoulder again. Remus ignored them both and tied the letter to the bird - maybe a bit too tight, because it pecked him angrily before flying off, down towards the village. He could stay there, maybe, it might not take very long. But his stomach growled. He turned to look at his friends.\n\u201cOk. Breakfast?\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to tell--\u201d\n\u201cYes, Padfoot, fine. Let\u2019s um\u2026 get some toast and go for a walk or something, ok?\u201d\nSo that\u2019s what they did. Remus buttered at least five slices of toast in the Great Hall, wrapped them in napkins and stuffed them into the pockets of his robes. the other three marauders followed him, watching cautiously as if they weren\u2019t quite sure what to make of him yet.\n\u201cRight.\u201d He said, once they were outside, \u201cYou all need to shut up and let me tell it to you, ok? No interruptions.\u201d\nThey nodded solemnly as they walked. He saw Sirius purse his lips.\nTough\n, Remus thought, spitefully.\nYou can listen to me, for once.\nSo, he talked.\nHe found it much easier than telling Dumbledore \u2013 at least he knew for sure that the marauders were on his side. He tried to explain everything with as little emotional context as possible. He had known there was a werewolf nearby. He went to find them, he met Livia, Ferox intervened.\n\u201cMoody talked to me last summer,\u201d he explained, finally, \u201cHe said something to me, and it made me\u2026 it just made me think about how useful I can be, that\u2019s all. I have to stop looking at my furry little problem as\u2026 well, as a problem. If we\u2019re going to war with dark creatures, then\nas\na dark creature I ought to be--\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a dark creature.\u201d James said, suddenly, \u201cYou\u2019re our Moony.\u201d\nRemus shrugged. He wouldn\u2019t have put money on James being the first to interrupt, but now he was pretty glad he had. He left a pause; there was nothing more to tell. James was still looking at him, with a small crease between his eyebrows. He pushed his glasses up his nose, clearly thinking very deeply. Peter, of course, looked anxious. He was staring at his feet, rubbing his hands together. Remus didn\u2019t look at Sirius. He looked for his fags instead.\n\u201cSo,\u201d James said, after swallowing, \u201cShe\u2019s gone now, has she? The werewolf?\u201d\n\u201cLivia,\u201d Remus said, cigarette between his teeth, \u201cYeah, I think Ferox scared her off.\u201d\n\u201cToo bloody right,\u201d James nodded, much more comfortable talking action, \u201cAnd I bet with Moody on the case she won\u2019t be back any time soon, eh? So, are you in a lot of trouble? With Dumbledore?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Remus sighed. He rubbed his sore hip, \u201cI think Dumbledore was more worried about me mucking up his spy ring, rather than breaking any rules.\u201d\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t want to see you hurt. Any of us.\u201d James said, sincerely. He eyed Remus\u2019s awkward posture, \u201cC\u2019mon, there\u2019s a bench down here, you can finish your toast.\u201d\nThey made slow progress down towards the edge of the lake, where there were a few stone benches. It was too cold for anyone else to be out at this time on a Sunday, and Remus watched the late morning mist drift across the dark surface of the water as he chewed on the remains of his crusts. Sirius hadn\u2019t spoken yet, since the owlery, and Remus was trying not to notice it. Sirius felt betrayed - Remus knew that as sure as he knew his own name. Betrayed even if he didn\u2019t really have a right to feel it.\nThis isn\u2019t about you\n. Remus wanted to hiss at doleful, silent Sirius.\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe we all slept through the most exciting night of the year, eh.\u201d James nudged Remus, trying to bring a bit of levity to the otherwise rather sombre atmosphere.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that exciting,\u201d Remus grinned back, giving him what he wanted, \u201cI was crap. If Ferox hadn\u2019t come\u2026 I dunno.\u201d\n\u201cD\u2019you think she could have disapparated with you?\u201d Peter asked, still wringing his pudgy little hands.\n\u201cI dunno.\u201d Remus replied, \u201cI think\u2026 I got the impression, anyway, that she needed to me agree. Like it had to be\nme\nwho made the decision \u2013 otherwise I s\u2019pose they could all just gang up and snatch me.\u201d\n\u201cWell then!\u201d James said, slapping his thigh triumphantly, \u201cThere\u2019s no problem, is there? Well I mean, there\u2019s no\nquestion\n.\u201d\n\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Remus said, quickly, \u201cI\u2019d never join Greyback.\u201d\n\u201cWell then.\u201d James repeated, satisfied.\nRemus looked at his hands, still greasy from the toast. He wiped them on his trouser legs. Of course not. Of course he would never.\nExcept\n. \u201cMoony?\u201d James said, sensing the odd quiet.\n\u201cI\u2019d never join him.\u201d Remus said, carefully. \u201cAnd Livia was\u2026 she was awful, but.\u201d He breathed in, \u201cNot everything she said was wrong.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Sirius burst out. Remus still didn\u2019t look at him, growing hot.\n\u201cJust that \u2013 well wizards treat us unfairly, and\u2026 and\u2026 Ugh, you lot wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d\nSirius sprang up, as if he had been wound up to breaking point. He glared at Remus as if he was about to start screaming at him. Then he walked away, at an impossible pace.\n\u201cBlack!\u201d James stood up, \u201cOi!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Remus waved a hand, \u201cSorry, I shouldn\u2019t have said anything, I can\u2019t explain properly.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s been such a moody git lately.\u201d James huffed, still watching the other boy storm away.\n\u201cGo after him, if you want,\u201d Remus said. \u201cHonestly, you\u2019re the best at sorting him out when he\u2019s like that. Me and Wormy\u2019ll find you later, yeah?\u201d\n\u201cOk\u2026\u201d James said, already moving, \u201cThanks, Moony!\u201d\n\u201cThose two are so weird sometimes.\u201d Peter said, watching James catch up. \u201cI swear I never know what anyone\u2019s on about any more. It\u2019s all war this and war that\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a bit of a pain, innit.\u201d Remus replied. He had meant it sarcastically, but poor Peter had never been very quick on the uptake.\n\u201cYeah, you know what I mean, don\u2019t you, Moony? I just think\u2026 we\u2019re only sixteen, can\u2019t we think about something\nother\nthan doing the \u2018right thing\u2019 all the time? We used to have\nfun\n.\u201d\nRemus was only half listening. He stretched, rubbing his hip again to see if it would move for him.\n\u201cThink I might to back to bed, Pete. Or the library. Why don\u2019t you go and see Dezzie?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You didn\u2019t know?!\u201d Peter stared at him incredulously as he helped Remus to his feet.\n\u201cKnow what?\u201d Remus asked, arching his back again for good measure.\n\u201cShe dumped me.\u201d\n\u201cOh shit.\u201d Remus blinked, \u201cSorry, mate! Was that last night too?\u201d\n\u201cLast\nweek\n.\u201d Peter said, with an uncharacteristic coldness in his voice.\n\u201cSorry!\u201d Remus said again embarrassed. He didn\u2019t think he had actually spoken to Peter about anything much in weeks \u2013 he\u2019d been so wrapped up in Sirius, and the wolf pack, and Sirius, and Christopher\u2026 he resolved to do much better with all of his friends. After all, as soon as he turned seventeen they would be all he had. \u201cI\u2019m\nreally\nsorry, Wormtail.\u201d He said, kindly, \u201cWant to play chess instead, then?\u201d\n* * *\nMonday 16\nth\nJanuary 1977\nRemus was genuinely sorry to hear about Peter and Dezzie. She\u2019d never really been part of their group, but she was a nice enough girl, and had made Peter happy \u2013 she had given him something that James and Sirius did not have, and that was special in itself. The breakup had ostensibly been simply down to a change in attitudes. They had been seeing each other since they were fourteen, and at sixteen it seemed that Desdemona wished to spread her wings a bit.\n\u201cShe might change her mind?\u201d Remus suggested to a glum faced Peter over their third chess game.\n\u201cDoubt it,\u201d Peter huffed. \u201cReckon she\u2019s got a crush on that Roman Rotherhide bloke. Wanker. Knight to F3.\u201d\n\u201cI thought Mary was seeing him?\u201d\n\u201cMary sees everyone,\u201d Peter sniggered, meanly. \u201cShe\u2019s like the girl version of Padfoot.\u201d\nFerox\u2019s reply arrived later that Sunday evening.\n\nRemus,\n\n\nI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t invite you into Hogsmeade, but I can meet you for supper on Monday evening at the castle. I\u2019ll meet you outside the Great Hall at 6pm.\n\nThat was ok. Good enough \u2013 he could ask what he needed to ask anywhere. Remus went to his lessons as usual on Monday, and told the marauders at lunch time. Sirius was speaking to him again, but not properly. For every small step forward, he and Remus seemed to take three enormous steps back again.\n\u201cI\u2019m having tea with Ferox tonight,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo I won\u2019t see you until later.\u201d\nHe knew James had quidditch practice, which Peter would be watching, now that he had no girlfriend. Sirius sat up straighter.\n\u201cShould we come too?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Remus asked, fixing him with a cold stare. Sirius shrugged and looked back at his soup.\nBy the time six o\u2019clock rolled around, Remus was practically pacing the halls. He didn\u2019t want to look overeager, so he\u2019d waited at the top of the landing before going down the main staircase at just one minute past the hour. This turned out to be something of a mistake. By the time he got there, Mary had found Ferox and struck up a conversation.\n\u201cRemus!\u201d She grinned as he descended, \u201cLook who\u2019s here!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Mr Lupin I\u2019m here to see,\u201d Ferox smiled easily, shaking Remus\u2019s hand. It all felt very grown up.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to convince him to come back and teach us again,\u201d Mary explained cheerfully, \u201cWe miss him, don\u2019t we, Remus?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 yeah, of course.\u201d Remus nodded. Mary smiled at him and touched his forearm, leaning into him in a very familiar sort of way. He couldn\u2019t remember if she\u2019d ever done that before.\n\u201cCan you wait here?\u201d She asked Ferox, still touching Remus, \u201cMarlene\u2019ll be down in a minute, she\u2019d love to see you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid we need to be getting on,\u201d Ferox said, kindly, \u201cMaybe another time, Miss MacDonald. Remus, shall we?\u201d\nRemus followed Ferox up the staircase, rather than towards the hall, leaving Mary at the bottom. \u201cThought we could do with a bit of privacy,\u201d Ferox murmured, \u201cProfessor Kettleburn has kindly let me borrow my old office.\u201d\nRemus had only been in the Care of Magical Creatures office once since Ferox had left \u2013 to request an extension on an essay after a full moon. Kettleburn was a spartan sort of man, who had chosen not to decorate at all, but who had stacks of paperwork strewn all over the place. Ferox tidied this neatly away with a swish of his wand, before summoning drinks and two plates for supper. The food appeared just as it did in the Great Hall \u2013 ham, egg and chips tonight.\n\u201cMy favourite,\u201d Ferox smiled, motioning that Remus begin eating. They tucked in quietly for a few minutes, and Remus enjoyed the novelty of sharing dinner with a friend, rather than hundreds of other people.\n\u201cSo.\u201d He said, mopping up the last of his egg yolk with a chip, \u201cI wanted to talk about Livia.\u201d\n\u201cLook at you,\u201d Ferox nodded at him, \u201cTwo years ago I could barely get you to say two words to me about yourself.\u201d\nRemus shrugged,\n\u201cNo time to be shy anymore, I s\u2019pose. There\u2019s a war on.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t I bloody know it.\u201d Ferox sighed. \u201cAll right, go on lad,\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d Remus took a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t want to join her \u2013 them \u2013 Greyback. I don\u2019t want to be a part of their\u2026 their pack, or anything like that.\u201d\nFerox nodded, but said nothing. Remus, emboldened, continued, \u201cBut\u2026 I think I could find them easily. I think they could find\nme\n. And they still want me. That\u2019s what Dumbledore wants, isn\u2019t it? A backdoor to the werewolves. I can do that. I know what I did was stupid \u2013 and I won\u2019t do it again, not while I\u2019m at Hogwarts, not until I\u2019m at least of age. But\u2026 now I know her, now I know what they\u2019re like, I\u2019m not afraid. I can do it.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Has Dumbledore said\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d Remus said, dismissively, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t\nasked\nme to do anything, because he never asks. He just makes sure you know what he wants. But there are things\nI\nwant, too.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what are those?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not signing the register, on my birthday.\u201d Remus said, steadily. \u201cI\u2019m not exposing myself to the ministry. I\u2019ve looked into it \u2013 if I do, I have to report to them for three days every month. They\u2019ll lock me up \u2013 I assume, it\u2019s not very clear from the information they put out. I can\u2019t keep a job, like that. If Dumbledore needs a spy, then he needs me to be untraceable, too.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d Ferox said again, \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not finished.\u201d Remus snapped. \u201cAfterwards. If we win. I want amnesty for the werewolves. Even Greyback\u2019s pack. Not Greyback, obviously, but his followers.\u201d\n\u201cRemus, that\u2019s completely\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo it isn\u2019t.\u201d Remus folded his arms. \u201cYou don\u2019t know. Livia might be batshit, but she\u2019s not wrong. A choice between freedom under Greyback or imprisonment under the ministry is an easy one to make.\u201d\nFerox looked at him, for a very long time. Remus drank his pumpkin juice, his throat very dry. His heart was beating so fast he thought that Ferox must be able to hear it.\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t necessarily things Dumbledore can do,\u201d Ferox said, slowly.\n\u201cBullshit.\u201d Remus set down his goblet, a little too hard on the desk.\n\u201cI can bring it to him.\u201d Ferox sighed, sounding defeated, \u201cBut I can\u2019t make promises.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Remus replied, coolly, \u201cI\u2019m seventeen in two months. So there\u2019s the deadline.\u201d\n\u201cBlimey.\u201d Ferox scratched his head. He sounded impressed, rather than angry, \u201cYou don\u2019t half remind me of Lyall, right now. What happened to the hot-headed kid always getting into scrapes?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m still hot-headed.\u201d Remus said, simply, \u201cI think Lyall probably was too. It\u2019s not that I think Dumbledore can solve all my problems. But I wanted to lay all my cards on the table.\u201d\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d Ferox nodded. \u201cAll\u2019s fair in love and war, eh?\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know about that.\u201d Remus replied.\nTheir plates vanished, suddenly, and then reappeared, bearing two big wedges of chocolate cake topped with fruit. They ate them quietly, both deep in thought, occasionally shooting looks at each other.\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going with Moody?\u201d Remus asked, casually. \u201cI s\u2019pose you probably can\u2019t tell me anything.\u201d\n\u201cYou suppose right,\u201d Ferox nodded. \u201cMoody\u2019s well, though. Complete nutter, but glad he\u2019s on our side.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Achilles?\u201d\n\u201cAchilles is fine.\u201d Ferox smiled. \u201cStaying with a friend of mine. Speaking of which \u2013 how long\u2019s the romance been going on, eh, Lupin?\u201d\n\u201cThe what?!\u201d Remus stared at him, wide eyed. Ferox laughed,\n\u201cWith Miss MacDonald, down there? I\u2019d have matched you better with Marlene, but I s\u2019pose the heart wants what it wants, eh?\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Remus relaxed, \u201cNo, Mary\u2019s just a friend.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Ferox said, obviously not quite believing him. \u201cWhat\u2019s brought on this personality switch, then?\u201d\n\u201cWhy does it have to be about a girl? Two years is a long time.\u201d Remus said, annoyed. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ve\nsuddenly\nchanged. Look, I first said I\u2019d help Dumbledore fight when I was fourteen.\u201d He tried to explain. \u201cAnd then last year, James Potter told us all that he planned to join, as soon as he left school, and we all said\nwe\nwould too, and I\u2026 I was always\ngoing\nto, you know, but just because James and Sirius wanted to. I never had a reason myself, really.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re\nall\ngoing to suffer, if you know who wins.\u201d Ferox said.\n\u201cYeah, I s\u2019pose.\u201d Remus nodded diplomatically. \u201cI know that. But I meant\u2026 well I never really had much of a stake in it, before. Now I\u2019ve met Livia, I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s going to be that great for me after school finishes, no matter who\u2019s in power. I want a stake. If I live.\u201d\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t compare yourself to them, Remus. The pack.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t really help it, can I? Everybody else will. You know my friend, Sirius Black?\u201d\n\u201cNot well,\u201d Ferox replied, \u201cThe Potters took him in, didn\u2019t they? I thought it was a bit odd, knowing his family.\u201d\n\u201cExactly!\u201d Remus said, triumphantly, \u201cSirius is my best friend, and a Gryffindor, and the Potters love him \u2013 but to everyone else he\u2019s still a Black. He\u2019ll spend the rest of his life trying not to be, no matter how many good things he does. Because people never forget things like that \u2013 they think that\nwhat\nyou are makes you\nwho\nyou are. It\u2019s the same for me.\u201d\nRemus was struggling now to keep explaining. Ferox looked completely lost. He sighed, heavily, \u201cI\u2019m sorry it has to go through you. You\u2019re the only person I know who has any weight with Dumbledore who I trust. Who trusts\nme\n.\u201d\nFerox watched him again, with a steady expression.\n\u201cI will\ntry\n, Remus. You\u2019re asking a lot.\u201d\nRemus frowned. He thought about Livia \u2013 her bare feet, her ragged clothes; her terrible cough and the hollow look in her eyes. It was no way to live.\nHe might be asking for a lot. But Remus had never asked for anything before in his life. He hoped Dumbledore remembered that."

            "content": "Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?\n\n\nMary, Mary, can I go too?\n\n\nThis one thing I will vow ya,\n\n\nI'd rather die than to live without ya,\n\n\nMary, Mary, where you goin' to?\n\nFriday 5th February 1977\nThe rest of January seemed to whizz by in a blur, and Remus just tried to get back to normal. The full moon landed early in the month, and Remus threatened to lock the marauders out of the shack if they didn\u2019t promise to stay inside this time. Eventually he knew he would weaken and allow them to begin letting him out again - but he felt that they ought to play it safe, at least for a while.\nThe sudden distance between Remus and Sirius was painful, and made all the more difficult by the fact that their relationship (such that it was) had been a secret all along. Remus resorted to his usual tactic, burying himself in his studies, while Sirius absorbed himself in Emmeline. He was sulking, Remus knew. And for once, he didn\u2019t blame him. The whole messy situation only proved to Remus that they had to put a stop to it as soon as they could. It was becoming impossible to stay friends, and they\nneeded\nto be friends before anything else.\nThe problem was, Sirius hadn\u2019t come to him at all since that night they\u2019d slept in the common room. Remus was terrified that this meant it was already over - that Sirius had come to the realisation on his own, and simply chosen to stop. And Remus would not allow that. It couldn\u2019t just be\nfinished\n, without either of them saying anything about it. Surely?\nYou held my hand.\nHe wanted to say.\nYou saw me cry.\nThe day after the February full moon, Remus lay in his usual hospital bed, pondering these things. He had a cut on his arm, which Madam Pomfrey had told him to practice his healing charms on. It was very basic, but he was so tired after his transformation,\n\u201cYou have to try, dear,\u201d the medi-witch said, unsympathetically, \u201cYou wanted to be able to take care of yourself after the moons, so you\u2019ll just have to learn to find the strength.\u201d\nHe prodded the cut, already healing by itself anyway, making another half-hearted attempt to fix it. Nothing. The marks Livia had left were dulled to pale pink now, and Madam Pomfrey thought they would probably vanish, in time, as they weren\u2019t inherently magical wounds.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to leave,\u201d she called to him, now, from her office. \u201cIf you\u2019re just going to sit there moping\u2026 Go and see your friends.\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t bother telling her that it was his friends - or rather, one friend in particular - he was moping about. But he never thought twice when she gave permission for him to leave, so he got up and dressed quickly, hurrying out of the hospital wing,\n\u201cSee you Tuesday!\u201d He called, on his way out.\nIt was after lunch, and there was only one lesson left that day - Care of Magical Creatures - which Remus wasn\u2019t much in the mood for. He was ahead of the rest of the class anyway, and no one would miss him. He sloped along the corridors aimlessly for a while, still thinking about Sirius and Emmeline, and how he was ever going to...\nwait a minute\n.\nHe stopped and frowned, looking at the nearest portrait. Something was very off about it. The painting depicted an elderly wizard with thinning hair and a neat little goatee peering through a large golden telescope. For some reason, he was wearing an enormous bright red curly wig. It didn\u2019t seem to bother him - he just kept adjusting the sight on his contraption, murmuring quietly to himself. Remus snorted, and looked at the next picture along.\nThis one contained a group of pretty, buxom young shepherdesses tending to their flock - and\nthey\nall had bright red wigs on too. The same with the next portrait - a witch carrying an overflowing basket of fruit, garish scarlet curls bouncing on her head. And the next - a sinister looking monk, whose red wig actually sat on top of his hood. None of the subjects of the paintings seemed at all perturbed, as Remus followed the trail of bizarre headwear to the third floor mezzanine.\n\u201cPadfoot!\u201d Remus gasped, when he found the culprit.\nSirius was at ease, hands in his pockets, chatting casually to a painting of a giggly sea nymph in a large golden frame. When she saw Remus she gave a shriek and dived into the waves below.\n\u201cAw, Moony, what\u2019d you scare her for?\u201d Sirius tutted, \u201cI was just about to cast the spell.\u201d\n\u201cThis is brilliant!\u201d Remus grinned, gesturing at all of the pictures he\u2019d passed, \u201cHow come you never told me you were doing it? Is James in on it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s taking the east wing,\u201d Sirius nodded, moving on to the next painting. \u201cWe just had the idea walking back to bed this morning. Sorry, thought you\u2019d be sleeping still.\u201d\n\u201cMadam Pomfrey let me go\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh right. You\u2019ll probably want to go to the library, or something? I\u2019m nearly finished here, no need for you to stick around.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I--\u201d\n\u201cOh shit!\u201d\nThe big grandfather clock in the great hall had begun chiming - every classroom door was about to burst open, and students come pouring out for their next lesson. \u201cThey\u2019ll know it\u2019s us!\u201d Sirius said, \u201cQuick!\u201d He pulled James\u2019s invisibility cloak out from his robes and raised it up like a tent.\nRemus hurried over to get under it, crouching slightly to compensate for their height difference. They both backed against the wall and waited. The doors began to slam open one at a time, and torrents of students filled the previously quiet space. Invisible and trapped, Remus realised that this was the best chance he\u2019d had in days.\n\u201cOi,\u201d he whispered, directly into Sirius\u2019s ear. He felt the other boy tense. \u201cAre you still angry with me?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you--\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re avoiding me.\u201d\n\u201cNo I\u2019m not.\u201d Sirius pushed back, suddenly, as a third year girl came a bit too close. He backed straight into Remus\u2019 chest, so that their whole bodies were now touching, practically. \u201cJames said to give you space.\u201d He murmured, \u201c\nAnd\nyou left me out of the Hog\u2019s Head mission, even after we said we\u2019d go together.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a mission!\u201d Remus whispered, struggling to keep his voice low. People were noticing the vandalised portraits now, pointing and laughing around them. \u201cAnd I never agreed to go together!\u201d\n\u201cWell it sent the message that you wanted space!\u201d Sirius shot back. He turned around, so that he could whisper into Remus\u2019s ear too. They were still touching in some places, trying not to in others.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, ok?\u201d Remus replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d take it so hard!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not taking it hard!\u201d Sirius spluttered, mortally offended, \u201cYou make me sound like--\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Remus challenged.\nHe could feel Sirius begin to pull away, so he kissed him.\nFuck it\n. Thankfully, Sirius kissed him back, and as the hallways emptied once again, the noise slowly petering out, the two boys hidden in plain sight under the cloak were completely oblivious.\nFinally, Sirius did pull away, and Remus allowed it.\n\u201cSo now you like me again.\u201d Sirius grumbled. \u201cCan\u2019t bloody keep up with you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? You were avoiding me!\u201d\n\u201cI thought you wanted me to!\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026 yeah, ok, I did, but not until we\u2019d at least talked.\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t see what there is to talk about,\u201d Sirius threw off the cloak. His hair fell softly back into place, while Remus\u2019s was abuzz with static until he smoothed it down. \u201cWe\u2019re either doing\u2026 y\u2019know, or we\u2019re not.\u201d\nGod, I love arguing with you,\nRemus thought, feeling the heat flare up his neck, desire for Sirius just about burning him up,\nI could argue with you forever.\n\u201cSo?!\u201d Sirius said, backing away from Remus, knocking him out of his lustful haze. \u201cWhich is it?\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a bit unfair to ask me that right\nnow\n\u2026\u201d\nSirius bit his bottom lip and cocked an eyebrow. Remus just about died.\n\u201cC\u2019mon, then.\u201d Sirius jerked his head, moving towards the nearest staircase, \u201cI\u2019m bunking off Divination, dorm\u2019s empty\u2026\u201d\n* * *\nThursday 10th February 1977\nWhat a mess.\nBy the end of the next week they were basically back to the beginning again. No talking, just touching. Sirius went out publicly with Emmeline, and at night he crept into Remus\u2019s bed - provided the coast was clear, of course. Sirius was nothing if not discreet, in this case at least. Conversely, Remus was finding that part more difficult than ever.\nA few months ago it would have been fine - it\nhad\nbeen fine. Just another secret to add to the list, another part of himself that he mustn\u2019t let others see. But a lot had happened since then. Lily knew he was a werewolf, for example - that had been a surprising relief. Sharing the secret with her had been a good thing; he was quite sure. Then there was Christopher, so courageous in bearing his soul, and all Remus could offer back were half-truths.\nWhen it came down to it, Remus could face a vicious killer in a dark alley; could make demands on Dumbledore himself. But he could\nnot\nsay no to Sirius.\nA real bloody mess.\nIn one moment of utter weakness, Remus even found himself nearly confessing everything to James. They were in the library, looking for some obscure Defence Against the Dark Arts textbook, when Potter brought up Valentine's \u00a0Day, which was looming.\n\u201cI\u2019m asking Evans to Hogsmeade this weekend, obviously,\u201d he said cheerily, \u201cShe\u2019ll say no, for tradition\u2019s sake, but I\u2019m winning her over, I can feel it.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d Remus sighed, running his finger along the supple leather spines of the ancient texts. It wasn\u2019t that\nhe\nwanted celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day - it was a stupid, girly day which he wanted nothing to do with - but he resented everyone\nelse\nwanting to do things for it.\n\u201cAnd Wormtail actually asked out Dorcas Meadowes.\u201d James laughed, crouching down to check a lower shelf, \u201cCan you believe that? Sometimes I think he\u2019s got more guts than any of us.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s Dorcas Meadowes?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve met her, haven\u2019t you? Hufflepuff in our year.\u201d\nRemus shrugged.\n\u201cI s\u2019pose Sirius is taking Emmeline to Hogsmeade.\u201d He said.\n\u201cYeah, \u2018spect so.\u201d James replied, pulling out a book and opening it to check the index. \u201cOr another one of his many adoring fans, if she dumps him before then.\u201d\n\u201cHmph.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Remus shook his head, picking up a book at random and pretending to read it.\n\u201cNot being a wee bit judgemental there, are you, Moony?\u201d James wheedled, grinning.\n\"No. Of course not!\u201d Remus fought to keep a straight face, \u201cPadfoot can do whatever he wants. But... don't you think he's... I dunno, it's a bit much, all these girls. Like he\u2019s showing off.\"\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\nloads\nof girls, he\u2019s been with Emmeline since December, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cJanuary.\u201d Remus replied, archly. \u201cHe was single over Christmas.\u201d\n\u201cWell then. That\u2019s fine. The rest are just flirting. He's always liked attention.\"\n\"Yeah, but...\"\n\"Look, you just need to let Sirius be Sirius. He's a bit of a twat sometimes, but he's had a rough time of it. Let him enjoy himself if he wants.\" James stood up and looked at him sideways, appraising. \"You know, Moony, wouldn't kill\nyou\nto have a bit of fun either.\"\n\u201cHa.\u201d Remus snorted.\n\u201cOh, mate!\u201d James leaned over his shoulder to read the book Remus had open, \u201cWell done, you\u2019ve found it!\u201d\nHave a bit of fun.\nSo, perhaps Remus could blame it all on James - what happened next, anyway.\n* * *\nSaturday 12th February 1977\nShe\u2019d been flirting with him for ages \u2013 Remus knew pretty well what flirting looked like, by now. In the way she smiled, head tilted downwards. The way she had started pressing a hand to his chest when he made her laugh (which definitely seemed to happen more than usual, too). That cute little wiggle girls do when they\u2019re fixing their tights. Eventually, they found themselves alone in the common room on that Hogsmeade weekend just before Valentine\u2019s Day, homework finished, sitting squashed up on the sofa \u2013 and she just\nasked\n. Which was more than Sirius had ever done.\nRemus and Mary always been good friends; he liked her a lot. Her sunny, carefree nature had always appealed to his own gloomier side; her confidence to his introversion. He had ignored the flirting altogether, finding it mildly flattering, but otherwise uninteresting, until she decided to stay at the castle with him instead of going to Hogsmeade.\n\u201cHow come you\u2019re not on a date, anyway?\u201d Remus asked, as they signed off the last few notes for their History essays.\n\u201cI wanted to spend time with you,\u201d she smiled at him, settling back into the couch, her thigh touching his. \u201cCan\u2019t have you here all lonely.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not as much fun as Roman Rotherhide, I bet,\u201d Remus laughed, still not quite believing the direction this was going. Her hand was on his knee. Was she going to leave it there? Oh crikey, no, she wasn\u2019t\u2026\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t know about that,\u201d she said, her voice low, leaning into him now as her long fingers moved slowly upwards, \u201cI\u2019d like to judge for myself\u2026\u201d she blinked slowly, and leaned in, kissing him softly on the lips. He was frozen to the spot. She smiled cheekily, \u201cWell? Do you fancy it?\u201d\nShe was very pretty. He wasn\u2019t as close to her as he was with Lily, so really, he reasoned \u2013 where was the harm? Whatever was going on with Sirius clearly didn\u2019t mean neither of them could look elsewhere. And if\nSirius\ncould do it, then so could he. Only fair.\nHe led her upstairs.\n\u201cYou\u2019re lovely,\u201d she whispered, lying on his bed, eyes dark. He ran his hand up her soft thigh. Between her legs she was slick like warm oil.\nAfterwards, he wasn\u2019t sure what to make of it. It was certainly nothing to complain about \u2013 she was gorgeous, and the blood heat of her around him was definitely very exciting. But it wasn\u2019t the same as those dark furtive nights with Sirius; had none of the rich complexity, the sure understanding. Mary\u2019s soft jelly breasts were no substitute for Sirius\u2019 firm grip. Her sweet panting sighs did not arouse him in the same way as Sirius\u2019 hot, rasping groans.\nAll things said and done, while Remus was certainly glad to have had the experience, he didn\u2019t think it was something he was much interested in repeating.\n* * *\nSunday 13th February 1977\nOnly a day after the Mary experiment, Sirius was back. It was mid-afternoon, but James and Peter were both in the library studying for an upcoming Muggle Studies exam. It began as ever, in silence and quiet, desperate need. Sirius was clutching and pulling at Remus\u2019s clothes \u2013 then he rolled over and seemed to stop. He sniffed the pillow.\n\u201cIs that\u2026? That smells like\u2026\u201d he inhaled again. \u201cMary\u2019s perfume?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus replied, uneasily. He had just removed his shirt and was feeling exposed already, not sure if they were stopping altogether or just making casual conversation. \u201cShe was here. Yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Right. You and her?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026 it was just a one off sort of thing. Is that\u2026 ok?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius\u2019 eyes clouded over slightly, as if his mind was working extra fast. \u201cYeah, of course. Good for you, mate!\u201d\n\u201cI know you two were\u2026 but it was ages ago now, and you\u2019re with Emmeline, so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOf course! I\u2019m pleased for you, honestly, Mary\u2019s great!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, she is.\u201d\nThere were a few moments of silence and Remus considered putting his shirt back on. But then Sirius leaned over, his expression changing, like a storm passing. He touched the scar that started at Remus\u2019 collar bone, dragged his finger down along its ragged path to his naval. Remus shivered.\n\u201cSo, how was it?\u201d\n\u201cWh-what?\u201d Remus just wanted to close his eyes, relax under Sirius\u2019 long fingers.\n\u201cSex.\u201d Sirius said.\nRemus\u2019s eyes opened, confused. He wanted to\nknow?!\n\u201cIt was\u2026 good. She\u2019s, um\u2026 so soft, y\u2019know. I mean, you\nknow\n\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius breathed into his neck, half on top of him now, his hand working Remus\u2019 belt.\nAfterwards they sat beside each other and all Remus wanted to do was lay his head on Sirius\u2019s burning chest and close his eyes and just\nbe\n. But he didn\u2019t. He stared at his friend, who was already lighting a cigarette, skin still pink and shining, and thought to himself, ruefully \u2013\nthis will never be enough\n."

            "content": "Friday 4\n\nth\n\nMarch 1977\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go mad.\u201d Marlene said, one evening, as the library was closing. She pressed her fingers into her eyes, exhausted. Her hair was fluffed up on her head like a dandelion from running her hands through it so often. \u201cI thought the OWLs were bad\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat rhymes,\u201d Mary sang, cheerfully, neatly rolling up her parchment.\n\n\n\u201cHelpful, thanks, MacDonald.\u201d Marlene rolled her eyes.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nYou\n\n\ndecided to keep Potions.\u201d Mary bopped her friend lightly on the head with her rolled up essay.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a requirement for Healer training college.\u201d Marlene sighed. \u201cI\n\n\nwish\n\n\nI didn\u2019t have to do it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you all hate it so much,\u201d Lily yawned, hoisting her satchel onto her shoulder, \u201cPotions is fun, it\u2019s logical.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, shut up, Evans.\u201d Mary and Marlene said in unison.\n\n\nRemus laughed, and put a fond arm around the redhead,\n\n\n\u201cPoor Lily,\u201d he said, in mock sympathy, \u201cSo misunderstood in your quest for knowledge.\u201d\n\n\nShe laughed too, and they all left the library together. They\u2019d been there every night of the week - except when Lily had prefect duties or Marlene had quidditch; then it was just Remus and Mary. Which was surprisingly ok - Mary had made a few teasing jibes about their brief liaison, but hadn\u2019t mentioned wanting to do it again, and appeared to be seeing Roman Rotherhide once more. Remus was relieved. One secret affair was quite enough.\n\n\nIt was early to be revising, but the four of them had decided to reconvene their study group this year in order to get through the first stage of their NEWTs. Final exams were still over a year away, but in Remus and Lily\u2019s opinion, there was no such thing as being too prepared, particularly with the foundation year exams due in June.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m knackered,\u201d Mary said, as they approached the portrait of the fat lady (her wig had been removed by Professor Flitwick only a few days beforehand - she had apparently grown quite fond of it). \u201cDay off, tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you want,\u201d Remus said, catching her yawn, \u201cI said I\u2019d do a big study group on Sunday, so I\u2019d be glad of the rest.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it, Lupin,\u201d Mary shook her head in disbelief. \u201cThat\u2019s perfect, though, leaves Saturday evening free.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGot another date with Roman, have you?\u201d Marlene asked, sounding a bit annoyed.\n\n\n\u201cYes, Marlene,\u201d Mary rolled her eyes, \u201cDespite your\n\n\nvery apparent\n\n\ndisapproval\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI just think you ought to slow down, that\u2019s all!\u201d Marlene snapped, running her fingers through her hair again.\n\n\n\u201cWell, as we\u2019ve discussed before, it\u2019s none of your business who I go out with, is it?!\u201d Mary said, arching an eyebrow at her friend. Marlene had turned an uncharacteristic shade of hot pink, and was looking at the floor. Remus looked at both girls in surprise. He\u2019d never seen them talk like that to each other before - usually they were the best of friends.\n\n\n\u201cCome on, we\u2019re all tired,\u201d Lily said, pushing forward, \u201c\n\n\nBlatherskite\n\n\n,\u201d she addressed the fat lady, who moved aside so they could all enter.\n\n\n\u201cEvans!\u201d James\u2019s shout met them even before they were halfway through.\n\n\n\u201cYeah yeah, good evening, Potter,\u201d Lily sighed, shaking her head. Remus caught her tiny smile, though she tried to cover it behind her long hair.\n\n\n\u201cAnd Moony!\u201d James continued, \u201cWhere are you been?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaking furious love to us all, obviously,\u201d Mary said, deadpan, pushing Sirius aside to sit nearest the fireplace.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Lily grinned, sitting on the hearth rug, \u201cHe\u2019s a stallion.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt took all three of us to satisfy him!\u201d Marlene piped up, looking a little bit happier.\n\n\n\u201cOh my god, please shut up\u2026\u201d Remus groaned, taking his seat in his usual armchair. \u201cWe were in the library, as if you didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh, of course,\u201d James winked at him. \u201cSay no more, Casanova.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBrr.\u201d Mary held her hands up to the fire, \u201cThis castle is freezing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nScotland\n\n\nis freezing.\u201d Sirius replied, monotonously. He was levitating a paper plane lazily about the room, slouched down in his chair.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only March,\u201d Lily said, perkily, \u201cIt\u2019ll start warming up soon enough. I can\u2019t wait for the summer.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNah, then I\u2019ll be too hot,\u201d Mary sighed, \u201cOur flat is ridiculous, even if you open all the windows. S\u2019pose I can do magic this year, though \u2013 am I allowed to if my family are muggles?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I do,\u201d Lily said, biting her lip, \u201cAre we not supposed to?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come and stay with me, Mary?\u201d Marlene said, \u201cMore room at our house, it\u2019s cooler.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell I wouldn\u2019t mind a holiday,\u201d Mary mused, still rubbing her hands. \u201cHaven\u2019t had once since dad lost his job. We used to go to the seaside every year. Margate or Skegness.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOoh, I went to Cornwall last year,\u201d Lily said, \u201cIt was lovely, we camped right near the beach.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCamping again.\u201d Sirius grumbled. \u201cDon\u2019t get Potter started\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEvans, have I ever told you how much\n\n\nlove\n\n\ncamping?\u201d James said, grinning madly from his position at the mantelpiece. He was fiddling with his golden snitch, tossing it from palm to palm, \u201cIt is one of my greatest pleasures in life.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about muggle camping, Potter,\u201d Lily tutted, smoothing her skirt over her knees self-consciously, \u201cIn muggle tents \u2013 no fancy extension charms\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t be that different,\u201d James replied, undeterred, \u201cThese two haven\u2019t even been camping,\u201d he nodded to Remus and Sirius.\n\n\n\u201cWe\n\n\nsort of\n\n\ndid, over Christmas,\u201d Remus said, throwing a daring glance at Sirius, who gave him a slow, conspiratorial smile.\n\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d James said, suddenly, tossing the snitch high in the air, then reaching to snatch it back, \u201cWe should all go camping!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sirius said, sitting up.\n\n\n\u201cThis summer!\u201d James nodded, excited, \u201cIt\u2019s our last summer before we all have to be grownups \u2013\n\n\nand\n\n\nwe\u2019ll all be of age, we should do it!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAll of us?\u201d Marlene asked, eyeing Mary.\n\n\n\u201cAll of us,\u201d James confirmed. \u201cWhat\u2019d you think, Evans?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Lily looked up at him, \u201cSeparate tents for boys and girls, right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPfft, you\u2019re no fun.\u201d Mary smirked. Lily kicked her from the floor, and continued,\n\n\n\u201cOk, Potter \u2013 on one condition\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnything!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMuggle tents.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nSaturday 5\n\nth\n\nMarch 1977\n\n\n\nIf you are seventeen years of age, or will turn seventeen on or before the 31st of August 1977, you are eligible for a twelve-week course of Apparition Lessons from a Ministry of Magic Apparition instructor, beginning on Monday 4th April 1977.\n\n\n\n\nPlease sign below if you would like to participate.\n\n\n\n\nCost: 12 Galleons.\n\n\n\nRemus stared up at the notice in pinned to the Gryffindor notice board and sighed.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll lend you the money.\u201d Sirius said, at his shoulder.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus, I\u2019m ridiculously rich.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quite aware of that.\u201d He snapped, irritably. He looked at the board again. Remus had wanted to learn how to apparate for almost his entire time at Hogwarts. \u201cOk.\u201d He nodded, \u201cBut I\u2019ll pay you back. I really will.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sirius nudged him with his hip, playfully. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be making more money than any of us, one day, you big swot.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHa.\u201d Remus snorted. \u201cNot likely, unless Dumbledore gets his act together.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDumbledore? What\u2019s he got to do with anything?\u201d\n\n\nRemus looked around, furtively. The common room wasn\u2019t busy, but it wasn\u2019t empty either.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you here.\u201d He said, \u201cUpstairs?\u201d\n\n\nSirius cocked his head, with a mock innocent expression that made Remus burst out laughing,\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nNot\n\n\nfor that. Get your mind out of the gutter, Black.\u201d\n\n\nThey headed up to the bedroom. It was nice and quiet there \u2013 Peter was serving a detention somewhere with Filch and James was patrolling.\n\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d Sirius went straight for Remus\u2019s bed, sitting cross legged and alert, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\nRemus sat down opposite him, not too close.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026 remember I had that dinner with Ferox? After I met Livia.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...yeah, of course.\u201d Sirius sobered up at once. They hadn\u2019t discussed it, since they\u2019d made up.\n\n\n\u201cOk, well don\u2019t get angry with me, but\u2026 I sort of made some demands. On Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\nSirius stared at him, blankly. Remus continued, with a hard swallow, \u201cI told him that if they want me to help them, if they want me to be like an emissary to the werewolves, or whatever, then I wanted something in return. Protection, for the others in Greyback\u2019s pack, first of all,\u201d\n\n\nSirius opened his mouth, then \u2013 apparently thinking better of it \u2013 closed it again, and waited. Remus carried on, watching him carefully for any sign of anger or disapproval, \u201cAnd I\u2019ve asked not to be forced to sign the register, on my birthday.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s reasonable, at least,\u201d Sirius breathed. \u201cBut, Moony\u2026 the other thing\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Remus nodded, \u201cThey\u2019re murderers, some of them. I know that. But they\u2019re\u2026 I don\u2019t think they know any other way. I think that if we want to show them that there are other choices, better ways to live, then\u2026 that has to start with kindness.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cKindness.\u201d Sirius repeated.\n\n\n\u201cNot forgiveness,\u201d Remus said, quickly, \u201cI\u2019m not saying they should go\n\n\ncompletely\n\n\nunpunished, but\u2026 I mean, you have to admit, the ministry has handled lycanthropy pretty poorly, so far. When we win this war, there\u2019s a chance to make things better. For\n\n\nall\n\n\nwizards. Even half-breeds.\u201d\n\n\nSirius was looking back at him, his brow very slightly furrowed. His deep blue eyes focussed intensely, as if he was searching for something in Remus\u2019s face. Then he gave a slight nod.\n\n\n\u201cThis is really important to you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Remus said, without missing a beat.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to convince\n\n\na lot\n\n\nof people.\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded.\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll help you, though.\u201d Sirius said, not breaking eye contact. \u201cMe and Peter and James \u2013 Evans too, probably, that girl worships you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t ask--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to,\u201d Sirius shook his head. He leaned forward and kissed Remus so, so gently on the lips, barely a whisper. \u201c\n\n\nAnything\n\n\nfor our Moony.\u201d\n\n\nLater that day, Remus was on his way to Flitwick\u2019s classroom \u2013 the kindly Charms professor had allowed him to use it for his tutoring sessions, provided everything was tidied up afterwards. He had a map of the south coast in his bag, and was hoping to get there early enough to have the chance to study it. If they were all going on holiday that summer, then\n\n\nsomeone\n\n\nwas going to have to organise it.\n\n\nThe first full moon of the summer would fall on the first of July, and Remus was hoping to stay one extra night at Hogwarts for that. He had already asked James if he could stay with the Potters for the following week, and James, of course, had eagerly agreed. Then they would have the camping trip, and then\u2026 Remus didn\u2019t have a clue what his next move would be. Back to Mile End, maybe; if Grant was still there. He couldn\u2019t just stay at the Potter\u2019s forever; not once he was seventeen.\n\n\n\u201cHiya Remus!\u201d Christopher waved, already waiting outside the classroom. Remus\u2019s heart sank, slightly. Of course Christopher was early. He never missed a chance to catch Remus alone.\n\n\n\u201cMorning, Chris,\u201d he smiled, politely. \u201cShall we go in?\u201d\n\n\nThey charmed the desks into a horseshoe shape, so that there would be plenty of room for practical demonstrations, then settled down, pulling out their books.\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing after?\u201d Christopher asked, over keen.\n\n\n\u201cDinner.\u201d Remus said, mildly, smoothing down his map and locating Cornwall. \u201cThen detention, I\u2019m afraid. \u2018til late.\u201d It was a full moon \u2013 though he\u2019d be in detention even if it wasn\u2019t. McGonagall never went back on a punishment.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d Christopher sighed, \u201cYou\u2019re always in detention these days.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d Remus laughed, \u201cI\u2019m a no-good yob.\u201d\n\n\nChristopher laughed, awkwardly. He meant well enough, but Remus had the impression that he was rarely comfortable with marauder style humour. It took getting used to.\n\n\n\u201cHave you read this?\u201d Christopher pushed a book across the desk, covering up the beach Remus had been inspecting. He sighed and looked at it.\n\n\nThe Charioteer\n\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d Remus shook his head, picking it up and reading the blurb.\n\n\n\nAfter an injury at Dunkirk, Laurie Odell is sent to a veterans' hospital to convalesce. There he befriends Andrew, a conscientious objector serving as an orderly. But when Ralph, a mentor from his school days, reappears in his life, Laurie is forced to choose between the sweet ideals of innocence and the distinct pleasures of experience.\n\n\n\n\nOh\n\n\n, Remus thought.\n\n\nIt\u2019s that sort of book.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a muggle book.\u201d Christopher explained, excitedly, \u201cIt\u2019s really good. You can borrow it, I\u2019d love to know what you think!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll give it a go, cheers.\u201d Remus nodded, quickly hiding it in the bottom of his bag before anyone else came in.\n\n\nAt that moment, there was a knock at the door. Both boys turned around to see Emmeline Vance poke her head around the door. She was an immensely beautiful girl, with a tumble of golden curls and large apple green eyes. Another Ravenclaw, she was a seventh year too, and had previously gone out with Roman Rotherhide himself. She smiled, stepping in,\n\n\n\u201cHello, Remus,\u201d she said, in her soft, girlish voice. He tried to be polite back, but he knew he sounded cold.\n\n\n\u201cHello Emmeline. I didn\u2019t expect you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, no, I\u2019m not here for your little study club thing,\u201d she smiled again, scrunching up her nose in a way that might have seemed cute or endearing to anyone but Remus and Christopher. \u201cI was hoping Sirius would be here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I see that!\u201d She laughed, throatily, sweeping her hair over one shoulder. \u201cBut he said he\u2019d meet me in the Astronomy tower half an hour ago\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus just shrugged at her, face blank. She tutted. \u201cWell, if you see him, will you tell him to meet me tonight, after curfew?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s busy tonight.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoing what?! Ugh, he\u2019s not seeing that MacDonald girl again, is he?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou never, know, with Sirius,\u201d Remus said, cruelly, trying not to smirk.\n\n\n\u201cWell. You tell him that if he\u2019s not careful he\u2019s going to lose me!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I definitely will.\u201d\n\n\nShe closed the door, and Remus snorted, shaking his head.\n\n\n\u201cDo you actually know where he is?\u201d Christopher asked, with a small frown.\n\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d Remus replied, \u201cBut I could guess. He\u2019s probably with James somewhere.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThose two.\u201d Christopher sighed, \u201cThey\u2019re funny, sometimes, but they cause so much trouble. How on earth Potter managed to end up a prefect I have no idea. And Black, he\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just what?!\u201d Remus said, sharply.\n\n\nChristopher blinked, startled.\n\n\n\u201cI know he\u2019s your friend! Sorry, I just meant\u2026 he\u2019s an arrogant tosser sometimes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus nodded, loosening up. He thought about Sirius\u2019s promise, made little more than an hour ago on Remus\u2019s bed. If other people couldn\u2019t see\n\n\nthat\n\n\nSirius, then it was their loss. Who were Emmeline and Christopher in the grand scheme of things?\n\n\nNot marauders; not important.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong.\" Remus shrugged. \"Right, where do you want to start?\u201d"

            "content": "Thursday 10th March 1977\n\u201cHAPPY BIRTHDAY, REMU!\u201d\nThree gangly, noisy, highly excitable teenage boys jumped onto Remus\u2019s bed at the crack of dawn. It was not the same as when they were eleven. For one thing, Remus\u2019s legs were a lot longer; for another, they were all much heavier.\n\u201c\nGerroff\nyou wankers,\u201d Remus grumbled, \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\n\u201cTime is immaterial,\u201d James said, wearing a brightly coloured pointed party hat, \u201cIt\u2019s your\nbirthday\n.\u201d\n\u201cYour seventeenth birthday!\u201d Sirius added, wearing a polka dot party hat at a rakish angle on his head.\n\u201cYou\u2019re\nof age\n!\u201d Peter said, lunging at Remus with a fourth hat, snapping the elastic under his chin.\nRemus glared at them all, stony faced.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to make me wear this all day, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nThey nodded, all three, in perfect unison, the streamers on their conical headwear bobbing and flashing in the dull morning light.\n\u201cIt\u2019s impervious to water,\u201d Sirius explained cheerfully, \u201cSo you can even shower with it on.\u201d He winked, and Remus hoped he wasn\u2019t blushing. Sirius had been in his bed only hours before, for a very different reason, and Remus was finding the quick transitions harder and harder to deal with.\nOnly half an hour later, and Remus had showered (hat still firmly on his head), opened about fifty birthday cards wishing him many happy returns (\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\nknew\nfifty people!\u201d) and eaten a generous slice of Mrs Potter\u2019s chocolate cake.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ll get your\nproper\npresent later,\u201d James said, cryptically, \u201cAt the party.\u201d\n\u201cYou lot are mad,\u201d Remus said, as they filed down into the common room, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t go to all this trouble.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Moony.\u201d Peter said, good naturedly.\n\u201cHappy birthday Remus!\u201d The girls chorused in the dining hall. They were all wearing party hats too, apparently thanks to Lily\u2019s persuasiveness.\n\u201cNice one, Evans,\u201d James winked at her, giving her a sly nod with his elbow, \u201cNew you wouldn\u2019t let the side down.\u201d\n\u201cOh, bugger off, Potter,\u201d she elbowed him back, looking very pleased and a bit flushed.\nThe usual three round rendition of \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 accompanied Remus\u2019s birthday breakfast, and he was so used to it by now that he even stood up and gave a shy bow once they\u2019d finally finished. Then the owls arrived.\nThere was a card from Ferox, which was unexpected - Remus hadn\u2019t been sure if they were still on speaking terms after their last meeting. There was also a note from Dumbledore.\nHe cracked the cherry red seal quickly under the table, and read it as fast as possible.\n\n\nMr Lupin,\n\n\nMany happy returns for the day.\n\n\nI understand we have a few things to discuss. Please present yourself at the headmaster\u2019s office at 4pm this afternoon.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nAlbus Dumbledore.\n\n\n\u201cHere we go.\u201d He sighed, under his breath. Sirius, who had an annoying habit of reading over his shoulder, leaned in,\n\u201cDo you want someone to go with you?\u201d\nRemus shook his head, but smiled at Sirius, trying to be kind,\n\u201cNah. Thanks for offering, but I think it\u2019s better if I do it alone.\u201d\nSirius nodded, looking troubled all the same.\nThe day passed slowly, the meeting with Dumbledore lurking at the end of it like some malevolent spider. Remus tried imagining the scenario over in his head \u2013 coming up with a script, or at least\nsomething\ncoherent to say in defence of his wild demands. Nothing came to him, and at 3.45pm that afternoon he found himself walking to the headmaster's office very slowly indeed.\nHe\u2019d been mad to even suggest this in the first place. No one else needed as reason to help in the war effort \u2013\nJames\nwould never do it. But then, Remus supposed, there was nothing James wanted that Dumbledore could give him. Unless Dumbledore held the key to Lily Evans\u2019s undying love.\nHe found the staircase already open, and ascended just as slowly, remermbering only at the very last minute to rip the party hat from his head.\n\u201cGood afternoon, Mr Lupin. Happy birthday.\u201d\nDumbledore was sitting at his desk, as usual. This time he wasn\u2019t writing letters; he was waiting patiently, a benign smile on his face.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Remus replied, warily, sitting down in the chair opposite. He thought for a moment before saying, \u201cD\u2019you mind just calling me Remus?\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish,\u201d Dumbledore nodded. He seemed to be in good humour. \u201cHow does it feel, coming of age?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d\n\u201cI have a few things for you, sent on to me from Mrs Orwell.\u201d\n\u201cMatron?!\u201d\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d Dumbledore gestured at a shoebox, which seemed to have appeared on the large mahogany desk out on thin air. \u201cI believe there are a few items in there which belong to you, which were held in trust at St Edmund\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cOh, wow\u2026\u201d Remus touched the lid of the box, tentatively, but didn\u2019t open it. He wanted to be alone for that.\n\u201cThere is also that matter of your inheritance.\u201d\n\u201cMy what?!\u201d\n\u201cYour father left a will. He left some provisions for your mother, and the rest to you. He was not a wealthy man, I should say, but nevertheless, his vault in Gringott\u2019s now belongs to you.\u201d Dumbledore pulled a key from his pocket and passed it across the desk.\nRemus held it in his hand, and thought about Lyall \u2013 who had not been on his mind in some months.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d He said, remembering his manners.\n\u201cAnd there are other legal matters, as well you know.\u201d Dumbledore clasped his hands in front of him, long slender fingers intertwined. He was waiting for a response.\n\u201cThe register.\u201d Remus said.\n\u201cThe register.\u201d The headmaster agreed. He pulled out a piece of parchment and pushed that across the desk too. It was a form.\nMinistry of Magic: Declaration of Lycanthropic Infection\n.\nRemus felt queasy. There was a dotted line at the bottom, awaiting his signature. He sat on his hands and looked at Dumbledore.\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do with it?\u201d\n\u201cLeo Ferox led me to believe that you already had a very good idea of what to do with it, Remus.\u201d The old man replied, his eyes serious. \u201cYou are an adult, I leave it in your hands.\u201d\nRemus picked up the parchment immediately, held it up to eye level and tore it clean in two. Dumbledore smiled again. \u201cAdmirably done.\u201d\n\u201cFerox told you something else, though.\u201d Remus said, trying to maintain eye contact but finding it extremely difficult. Dumbledore was not like anyone else - he smelled just as strongly of magic as every other witch or wizard, but nothing else. He had no unique signifier at all.\n\u201cHe did. I think, perhaps, you can anticipate my response.\u201d\nRemus felt something deflate inside of him, making room for the coming rage.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s a no.\u201d He said, flatly.\nDumbledore inclined his head, gently,\n\u201cNot entirely. A request for patience, perhaps.\u201d\n\u201cWith respect,\u201d Remus heard the hardness in his own voice, and it surprised him, but made him braver, \u201cThere isn\u2019t time for patience.\u201d\n\u201cThere never is, when one is young.\u201d Dumbledore replied, softly. \u201cRemus, I know how things must seem to you, believe me.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t see her. They\u2019re suffering. Right now.\u201d\n\u201cMany people are suffering, Remus. You have spent precious little time in the wizarding world yet-\u201c\n\u201cWhose fault is that?!\u201d Remus muttered fiercely. Dumbledore gave him a silencing glance,\n\u201cBut once you\nhave\n, you will see, you will understand why attitudes are a veryu long way from changing. What you are asking\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat about what YOU\u2019RE asking?!\u201d Remus shouted, incandescent, \u201cOf Ferox, and Moody and the Potters and---\u201d\n\u201cI am asking for an enormous leap of faith!\u201d Dumbledore said very loudly \u2013 he didn\u2019t shout; you couldn\u2019t call it shouting at all \u2013 but it was no longer kind. \u00a0\u201cFrom many people. And I will\nkeep\nasking until the war is won. That must be our focus, for now.\u201d\n\u201cI\nwant\nto win the war,\u201d Remus said, still trying to control his volume, \u201cAs much as anyone. But I want something\nworth\nwinning, too.\u201d\n\u201cIn time. When we have the resources. When we have the strength to fight another battle.\u201d\n\u201cI want a promise.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m aware of that.\u201d Dumbledore said, his voice changing almost imperceptibly, a deep frown lining his forehead. \u201cI cannot give you one.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Remus stood. \u201cThen I\u2019m promising\nyou\n. I\u2019m not giving up.\u201d\nHe was furious, and Dumbledore had the gall to smile at him.\n\u201cI would expect no less from Lyall Lupin\u2019s son.\u201d\nRemus wanted to scream\nfuck you\n, but decided that as he\u2019d already been disowned from one institution today, it was probably best to avoid any risk on expulsion. He grabbed the shoebox, turned and marched out.\nRemus was practically blind with rage as he pelted down the spiral staircase from Dumbledore\u2019s office, shoebox under his arm, head bowed, so that he ran straight into Sirius waiting at the bottom.\n\u201cWoah!\u201d Sirius said, pushing both hands against Remus\u2019s chest in an attempt to slow him down, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Moony?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Remus snarled.\n\u201cJust waiting for you \u2013 I know you didn\u2019t want company, I just thought--\u201d\n\u201cYou never bloody listen!\u201d Remus ranted, pushing past. Sirius grabbed his arm and wouldn\u2019t let go, allowing Remus to half drag him along the corridor,\n\u201cI know, I\u2019m terrible,\u201d he was saying, jogging slightly to keep up with Remus\u2019s longer strides, \u201cNever do as I\u2019m told, do I? Keep shouting at me, I deserve it \u2013 hey, want to hit me?\u201d\nRemus stopped and looked at him, the mercurial grin on his face. That Sirius Black grin.\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to hit you.\u201d\n\u201cOh good. Want to punch a wall?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus carried on walking, a bit slower.\n\u201cWant to get stoned?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cDrunk?\u201d\n\u201c...Maybe.\u201d\n\u201cPerfect!\u201d Sirius said. they were now walking at a regular pace, towards the dining hall, \u201cBecause I think that\u2019s what half the school has in mind after dinner. What\u2019s in the box?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d Remus held it on both hands, now. It wasn\u2019t very heavy, there couldn\u2019t be much. He could feel leaves of paper sliding around inside. \u201cJust some stuff, I think my dad left to me. I\u2019m not opening it until later.\u201d\nSirius shrugged, easily,\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d\n* * *\nSirius\u2019s general loveliness continued through dinner \u2013 sausages and mash with onion gravy \u2013 until desert, when Emmeline appeared. Remus had been halfway to a good mood when she showed up at their table and squeezed herself onto Sirius\u2019s lap. She kissed him, full on the mouth, for a long time.\n\u201cHappy birthday, Remus,\u201d she smiled politely, once they had finished.\nHe nodded in response, and set down his spoon. She didn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cI\u2019m\nso\nexcited about the party.\u201d She said, generally, to the table.\n\u201cShould be good,\u201d James said, jovially, \u201cMoony\u2019s birthdays always are.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\ndoes\neveryone call you Moony, anyway?\u201d Emmeline asked, looking at Remus. He scowled at her,\n\u201cNot everyone. Just my friends.\u201d\nShe blinked, and frowned, the creases in her brow marring her beauty only momentarily. Sirius squeezed her waist,\n\u201cHey, Em, why don\u2019t I meet you later? We\u2019ve got some stuff to do to get ready.\u201d\n\u201cOk,\u201d She smiled again, \u201cRemember your promise\u2026\u201d she snogged him again.\n\u201cPromise?\u201d Remus asked, upstairs in their bedroom, fifteen minutes later. James and Peter were overseeing the decorations in the common room, and Sirius had made up some excuse for not helping. \u201cWhat did you promise her?\u201d\n\u201cOh, just that I\u2019d walk her back to her common room after the party.\u201d\nRemus raised an eyebrow,\n\u201cVia the Astronomy Tower?\u201d\nSirius laughed, unbuttoning his shirt to change,\n\u201cMaybe. Why?\u201d\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Remus sat on his bed. The shoebox was still unopened, on his bedside table. He wasn\u2019t going to look today. Maybe not even tomorrow.\n\u201cWhat about you and Mary?\u201d Sirius asked, selecting a clean black shirt from his messy chest of drawers, \u201cThat thing finished now, or what?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus nodded, watching him.\nThis is it\n, he thought,\nthis is when you tell him\n. \u201cIt was just an experiment, sort of. \u2026Do you know what I mean?\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d Sirius murmured, more focussed on buttoning up his shirt. \u201cWhat, wasn\u2019t good?\u201d\n\u201cIt was ok. Not as good as\u2026\u201d he swallowed, and said it fast, \u201cNot as good as when it\u2019s just you and me.\u201d\nSirius looked up from his buttons, staring at Remus across the room. Remus was grateful for the distance. Sirius\u2019s expression was hard to read, so Remus pressed on. \u201cIs it like that for you?\u201d\nSirius returned to his dresser, looking for jeans now. His back turned, he said quietly.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cPardon?\u201d Remus said, raising his voice.\nSirius sighed, but didn\u2019t turn around. He closed the drawer, apparently deciding that the jeans he had on would do.\n\u201cI said yeah. It\u2019s better with you.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Remus was so surprised by this response that he couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say. Unfortunately, this gave Sirius an opportunity to speak instead. He turned, sweeping his long hair back over his head, casually.\n\u201cI s\u2019pose because we know each other so well, eh? Right, I\u2019d better get down there and help before Prongs comes after me with a jelly-legs jinx! We\u2019ll send Peter to get you when it\u2019s all ready.\u201d\nWith that, Sirius disappeared down the stairs.\n* * *\nFour hours later, and Remus was well and truly drunk. Not drunk,\npissed\n. Bladdered. Trollied.\nParalytic\n. He couldn\u2019t remember how much he\u2019d had, and he didn\u2019t care. He was going to have a good time if it killed him. Fuck Dumbledore. Fuck Greyback, Ferox, Livia, Emmeline and Sirius fucking Black. The party was in full swing, everyone now wearing a shiny pointy birthday hat, bopping along to the blaring music. Remus hadn\u2019t even minded the disco tracks.\nHe staggered to his arm chair and sank into it with yet another bottle of something lovely and strong. He was feeling very warm and very sleepy. Lazily, he allowed his gaze to wander to Sirius, chattering by the turntable, hips slouched forward\njust so\n. Remus let himself stare for just a little bit. He was entitled. Their first kiss was exactly a year ago. It was a silly little anniversary, considering everything that had happened in between, but Remus felt a small purr of satisfaction all the same.\nFucking prick.\n\u201cHim and Emmeline have been together a while now.\u201d Lily said to Remus, coming to sit on the armrest. Her eyes were wide and unfocused, she had an easy smile. Remus carefully took control of his facial features and smiled back at her as if he hadn\u2019t a care in the world.\n\u201cYou sound surprised.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I am a bit. I didn\u2019t see him as the sort of bloke who wants a\nregular\ngirl.\u201d\nRemus shrugged, because he couldn\u2019t speak without saying too much. Lily carried on regardless. \u201cAnd \u2013 I know it sounds horrible, and I know he\u2019s your friend, so juss tell me to shuddup, but I did sort of think\u2026 y\u2019know, that he\u2019s only goin\u2019 out wif her to upset his family.\u201d\n\u201cWhaddyou mean?\u201d Remus asked, taking a very long swig from his firewhisky.\n\u201cOhh, y\u2019know,\u201d Lily slurred, maybe even drunker than he was, \u201cEvr\u2019y one knows Black\u2019s on a weird crusade \u2018gainst his mum\u2026 never goes wif pureblood girls. There was\nMary\n\u2026\u201d she started counting Sirius\u2019s conquests off on her fingers, \u201cshe\u2019s muggleborn\u2026 Evangelina, Florence, Avni\u2026 now Emmeline.\u201d\n\u201cMight just be a coincidence.\u201d Remus was worried he might not be able to control his voice much longer; it was getting horribly high and nervous.\n\u201cPfff.\u201d Lily laughed, spilling some of her own drink. \u201cSssssrus Black never does\nanyfin\nby coincidence. Issss allll calculated wif him.\u201d She chuckled to herself, raising her goblet to her lips, \u201cHe\u2019d shag a vampire if there was one at Hogwarts.\u201d\nRemus stood up very suddenly, knuckles cracking. Lily almost fell off the arm of the couch in fright,\n\u201cWassup?\u201d She asked, confused, looking blearily up at him.\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m going to be sick.\u201d Remus said, realising that he really was. He bolted away and up the stairs as fast as he could and stumbled into the bathroom just in time, retching into the toilet bowl.\nHe rocked back on his ankles, sweating and cold. He\u2019d drunk too much, now he just wanted to lie down and sleep and not think about anything. Remus brushed his teeth and washed his face in cold water. He felt less queasy, but no less sober. He pulled on his pyjama bottoms and opened the door.\nSirius was standing on the other side, leaning against his bed post, with his hands in his pockets. He looked so thoroughly himself. Their eyes met and held. Sirius broke first.\n\u201cCame up to check you\u2019re all right.\u201d\nRemus closed the door behind him, stepping forward.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he replied, warily, \u201cJust a bit too pissed, that\u2019s all. Going to bed.\u201d\n\u201cLook, about the stuff I said,\u201d Sirius started. Remus braced himself, not sure what was coming. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d Sirius said, helplessly. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I am but\u2026 I\u2019m just\nsorry\n, ok?\u201d\nHe placed a hand on Remus\u2019 shoulder, seemingly in an apologetic gesture. It was hot on Remus\u2019 bare skin, but he didn\u2019t shrug it away. He just hoped that they might finally part, and he could go to bed. Sirius would return downstairs to the party. But instead, Sirius kissed him. Feeling a fool, Remus kissed him back, hungrily, toothpaste and whisky.\nSirius pushed forward, stumbling slightly, and leaned heavily on Remus, gripping both his shoulders now. Remus pulled away, suddenly remembering what was wrong.\n\u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d He said.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius slurred, grinning, \u201cSo\u2019re you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus agreed. He pulled back, leaving Sirius to balance by himself. He rubbed the back of his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should\u2026 I think you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d\n\u201cSince when do you care?\u201d Sirius purred, leaning in again. Remus stepped back, sharply, pressing his hand to Sirius\u2019 chest to keep him at bay.\n\u201cNo, Sirius. What about Emmeline?\u201d\nSirius shook his head dizzily, frowning.\n\u201cFuck Emmeline!\u201d He grunted. Remus rolled his eyes,\n\u201cBut you already\ndo\n, don\u2019t you, Black? That\u2019s the problem.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Sirius spoke slowly, mind foggy with drink, \u201cWe have to stop our\u2026 thing, just because of her?\u201d\n\u201cOur \u2018thing\u2019!? God, Sirius, you\u2019re unbelievable.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cSiiiiiiiriuuuuuuuus\u2026\u201d Emmeline\u2019s tipsy voice echoed up the staircase, \u201cWhere are youuuuuu?\u201d\nThey both turned, looking down into the shadows.\n\u201cYou\u2019d better go to her.\u201d Remus said, walking over to his bed. Sirius followed him like a lost puppy, pulling at the waistband of his pyjama bottoms needily.\n\u201cC\u2019mon, just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\u201cSiiiiriuuuuuuus\u2026. I\u2019m coming to get you!\u201d\nRemus pushed him away one last time,\n\u201cGo on, I don\u2019t want her up here!\u201d\nSirius stared at him for a bit longer, drink still blurring his reactions, making him slow and stupid.\n\u201cOk, but I\u2019ll come back\u2026 we can talk\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus said, again. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked. It\u2019s over. Goodnight, Sirius.\u201d"

            "content": "Remus woke up the next morning with a hangover and an enormous sense of relief. He\u2019d had to be drunk to do it, but it was done. No more jealousy, no more worrying, no more anxious questioning. The key now, he decided, was maintaining a distance, and building barriers.\nBy the time he had finished his shower on the morning after his seventeenth birthday, Remus had a plan of action. He would close the door on whatever his relationship with Sirius had been - it was fine to look upon Christmas as a fond memory, or to feel a little bit lonelier, a little less whole - but this was entirely necessary, both for his health and his sanity.\nSirius was not the whole world, as much as he might seem it sometimes.\nRemus had demonstrated this almost immediately. Upon exiting the bathroom, he bumped into James - who looked as though he hadn\u2019t touched a drop of liquor the night before, despite having had just as much as everyone else. That infuriating Potter good fortune apparently applied to hangovers, too.\n\u201cMorning, Moony!\u201d He grinned, rosy cheeked in his quidditch robes. Today was not a practice day, but why should that stop James? He raised his broom, \u201cFancy a spin around the pitch?\u201d This was an old joke - he always asked, and Remus always pulled a face.\nRemus glanced at the two made beds, and the two with the curtains still closed, where (presumably) Peter and Sirius were still fast asleep.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus said. \u201cGo on, then.\u201d\n\u201cEh?!\u201d James stopped in his tracks.\nRemus nodded, casually,\n\u201cI\u2019ll go with you. I ought to get better at flying, might be useful when we finish school. I\u2019ve got your old broom somewhere, let me dig it out\u2026\u201d\nCredit to James, after his initial surprise he was all for the idea, and even held his tongue when he saw the state of Remus\u2019s dusty, neglected broomstick. He simply offered to polish it, then led Remus down to the quidditch pitch jabbering about simple, basic exercises to \u2018get your confidence up\u2019.\nAnd it wasn\u2019t awful. James was a very patient teacher, and Remus felt in safe hands - the bespectacled boy didn\u2019t even laugh after the third time he fell off. Afterwards, Remus felt he even understood James a little better. It was a very wholesome feeling, walking back to breakfast, hungry and aching and full of energy. This first experiment had gone so well, in fact, that Remus decided he would say yes to anything his friends asked of him from now on. In this way, he would keep himself busy until Sirius went back to being whatever he\u2019d been before.\nAt breakfast they were greeted by a row of red eyed, sickly-faced Gryffindors, all leaning sleepily on their elbows, Mary and Marlene sitting back to back, propping each other up.\n\u201cChrist,\u201d Mary squinted at James and Remus, \u201cYou\u2019ve not been\nexercising\n?! Bloody lunatics.\u201d\n\u201c\nYou\nwent, Moony?!\u201d Sirius looked up, wincing and rubbing his apparently sore neck.\nRemus just gave him a small shrug, then looked away. Sirius didn\u2019t try to talk to him again.\nThey were halfway through the meal - Remus as usual eating half his bodyweight in fried bread, eggs, baked beans and bacon; everyone else picking at their own plate with faintly nauseous expressions or else nursing a large mug of black coffee - when Lily straightened up, eyes wide suddenly, as if electrified.\n\u201cOh shit!\u201d she said, then kicked James under the table, \u201cPotter!\u201d She hissed, \u201cWe never gave Remus his present!\u201d\nJames smirked at her, and Remus raised an eyebrow,\n\u201cYou and James got me a present? Together?\u201d\n\u201cWe all did,\u201d James laughed, \u201cAnd there\u2019s no need to beat me up, Evans, I\u2019ve got it right here,\u201d he withdrew a brown leather box from his robes. It was about the size of his hand, smooth and expensive looking, with a gold embossed border. It looked like the sort of thing girls kept their pricier jewellery in.\n\u201cYou all\u2026?\u201d Remus accepted the box, curiously. \u201cI hope you didn\u2019t spend too much, you know I can\u2019t--\u201d\n\u201cOh, shut yer face, Moony,\u201d Peter yawned, prodding his porridge dazedly, \u201cWe had a whip-round for you - almost everyone in Gryffindor wanted to put in.\u201d\n\u201cNot just Gryffindor, either,\u201d Marlene grinned, \u201cNearly everyone we asked, even some teachers!\u201d\nRemus was just looking down at the box, now, because he knew he had probably gone red. Some hot, sickly bubble of emotion was burning his throat, so he swallowed, hard, which didn\u2019t help.\n\u201cOpen it, Remus!\u201d He heard Lily\u2019s voice. He pried it apart, and the box sprang open in a pleasingly neat motion. The interior was midnight blue velvet, and nestled among the folds was the most beautiful piece of treasure Remus had ever seen.\nIt was a golden pocket watch, on a long, fine chain, polished to a high shine so that it was practically glowing. The case was decorated with intricate, vine-like swirls and patterns surrounding a shield at the centre which had been engraved in elaborate script with his initials:\nR. J. L.\nHe snapped it open with the lightest touch, and saw inside that the clock face was mother of pearl, and shimmered gorgeously beneath the golden hands which ticked away reassuringly. The other half seemed to contain a compass.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think they worked at Hogwarts?\u201d He murmured,\n\u201cIt\u2019s special!\u201d Mary said, eagerly, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t point north, or wherever normal ones do. If you say the name of somebody you love, it points you in their direction!\u201d\n\u201cTry it out, Moony!\u201d James encouraged.\nRemus looked up at his friends, nervously, then quickly raised the watch to his mouth and whispered,\n\u201cLily Evans.\u201d\nAt once, the needle spun into place, pointing directly across the table. Lily grinned bashfully. James kicked him under the table,\n\u201cBloody ladies man.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re all amazing.\u201d Remus said, hoping he didn\u2019t sound too choked up. \u201cBloody amazing.\u201d\nFor the first week, Remus\u2019s new regime seemed pretty effective. It certainly kept him busy. He said yes to everything; happily dropping whatever he was doing at a minute\u2019s notice to help a younger student with their homework, or call a group study session when the Care of Magical Creatures NEWTs class panicked over sphinxes. He accompanied Lily on patrols, he discussed literature with Chris, talked quidditch tactics with Marlene and played endless games of chess with Peter (and lost every time). He was the angel of Gryffindor tower.\nBecause Sirius was not the only thing Remus was ignoring.\nThe old shoebox Dumbledore had given him sat underneath his bed still, gathering dust and unopened, as it probably had been for many years \u2013 perhaps on some shelf in Matron\u2019s office.\nWhy was it a shoebox?\nRemus wondered, as he tossed and turned in his bed every night. Something so mundane, so every day. It made whatever was inside seem all the more terrifying. Trust Matron to be so heartlessly practical. It wasn\u2019t even from a good shoe shop, like Clarks or Johnson\u2019s. It was an economy brand, like everything else he\u2019d ever received at St Edmund\u2019s.\nThe box might have contained any number of things; and it wasn\u2019t that Remus wasn\u2019t curious. It wasn\u2019t as if he didn\u2019t\ntry\nto imagine what was in there. Deeds to a house he could go and live in, that would be pretty brilliant. Maybe some old money. Photographs. A letter from his father, an explanation - it might contain answers to questions he hadn\u2019t even known to ask.\nBut he didn\u2019t open it. He knew that once he opened the box, all of the mystery would disappear, and he would be left with something disappointing. Because there could be nothing inside that could\ntruly\nsatisfy him.\nSo, keeping busy helped; making sure he exhausted himself each day so that he fell straight to sleep each night, even when the other boys stayed up chatting, plotting pranks. But Sirius himself helped, too. By some incredible twist of fate, he appeared to be giving Remus space.\nIf Sirius remembered Remus\u2019s harsh words from the night of the party, then he didn\u2019t mention it. But he didn\u2019t try to get him alone, or treat him with any kind of resentment or disdain. Remus surmised that Sirius had either:\n\nbeen too drunk to take anything in, or;\n\ntaken Remus at his word, and chosen to back away quietly.\n\nFor Remus, with exams on the horizon, option 2 was by far the most preferable, so he decided to believe it.\nTheir separation was so smooth, and so complete, that soon even Remus had a hard time believing they\u2019d ever been close at all. Surely, to everyone else, it must seem that nothing had changed at all. Sirius was still Sirius - outgoing, girl-loving, cheeky, rebellious, devastating. And Remus was just Remus - quiet, private, studious and long-suffering secondary marauder.\nAs March drew to a close, the birthday party now weeks behind them, there was only one moment when the situation very nearly came to a head, but was quickly deflated, with help from an unexpected quarter.\nIt was late one Friday afternoon, and Remus was hosting an introductory duelling workshop. Christopher was there \u2013 Christopher was never far away, these days \u2013 but most of the class were beginners, and much younger. They were just grasping some basic disarming and diversionary spells, when the door to the Charms classroom opened, but no one walked in. Everyone turned to look, and muttered \u2018Peeves\u2019, before returning to their attack stances. Remus knew better.\nHe followed the scent about the room, and watched the open door of Flitwick\u2019s office moved only very slightly, as if someone had brushed the handle on their way inside. Flitwick trusted Remus, and left his office open in case they needed any equipment from inside - he kept a number of large mattresses which were good for duelling, as well as an emergency healing kit in there. Remus cleared his throat,\n\u201cThat\u2019s good! Keep practicing, remember to enunciate nice and loudly, for me\u2026 I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\nHe slipped around the edges of the room as he said this, then stepped inside the office.\n\u201cSirius,\u201d Remus hissed, \u201cGet out, this isn\u2019t--\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just hiding from Filch! Have a heart, Moony!\u201d Sirius whipped back the invisibility cloak, a familiar grin on his face. The sort of grin that usually got him whatever he liked. Remus bristled.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the cloak, hide somewhere else! I\u2019m nearly finished in here, anyway, they\u2019ll be leaving in a minute.\u201d\n\u201cWell then it\u2019s no big deal, is it? I\u2019ll just stay \u2018til they\u2019re all gone. Might even learn something!\u201d\n\u201cRemus? Are you ok in there?\u201d A tap at the door. Christopher.\n\u201cYeah, sorry!\u201d Remus gave Sirius one last furious glance, before stepping out. Sirius grinned and vanished again. Remus left the door open, and he knew that Sirius had got bored and left the office. Remus pictured him leaning casually against the wall, observing with a wry smile.\nRemus carried on teaching as best he could, trying to ignore the distraction. He felt horribly exposed, being watched like that, knowing that Sirius was so near. When the class finally finished, Remus ushered them all out, saying that the room was needed for something else. Everyone left, chattering excitedly about the weekend ahead. Everyone except Christopher.\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you clear up,\u201d he said, eagerly, as the last few students filtered out, shouting their goodbyes to Remus as they went.\nChristopher and Remus made short work of rearranging the Charms classroom, restoring it to its usual orderliness. He could feel Sirius watching them the whole time, the hairs on the back of his neck standing up.\n\u201cDid you read that book?\u201d Christopher asked, \u201c\nThe Charioteer\n?\u201d\nRemus winced, but nodded,\n\u201cYeah, it was good.\u201d\nIt had been good. Hard to read, at points, worryingly relatable. But something of a relief, too.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad you liked it!\u201d Christopher said. Remus could imagine Sirius pulling a face at Chris getting so excited over a\nbook\n. \u201cWhat about the ending?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah, it was good. I liked it.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Christopher wrinkled his nose, \u201cI didn\u2019t. I wish Laurie had picked Andrew, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nOf course\nChristopher identified with Andrew - sweet and bookish and chaste.\n\u201cI liked Ralph.\u201d Remus shrugged, \u201cEven if he wasn\u2019t perfect, he was more\u2026 I dunno. Exciting?\u201d\nRemus had thought Ralph sounded really fucking sexy, actually - but he had been picturing Sirius the whole time, which might have had a lot to do with it. He dearly hoped that if Sirius was eavesdropping - and of course he was, he was Sirius, after all - that he didn\u2019t understand a word Christopher was saying.\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d like him best,\u201d Christopher said, with a note of sadness. He was standing next to Remus now, his satchel over one shoulder, ready to go.\nJust go\n, Remus begged, inwardly. \u201cHe reminded me a bit of your friend, Sirius Black.\u201d\n\u201cOh?!\u201d That got his attention. And Sirius\u2019s too, Remus could practically feel him straighten up.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Christopher smiled coyly, \u201cSorry, but it\u2019s pretty obvious you have a bit of a thing for him.\u201d\nRemus just blinked, struck dumb. Christopher laughed softly, \u201cIt\u2019s a waste of time, Remus, can\u2019t you see that? Yeah, he\u2019s\u2026 beautiful, and everything, but he\u2019s clearly girl-mad. You ought to\u2026 I mean, you\ndeserve\nsomeone who cares about you as much as you care about them.\u201d\n\u201cChristopher, I don-\u201d\nChristopher cut him off with a kiss - he just reached up and\nkissed\nRemus, as if it was that easy. Remus\u2019s first instinct was to push him away; this was nothing\nlike\nwhat he\u2019d wanted. Fortunately, it was only the briefest brush of the lips.\n\u201cOh, Chris\u2026\u201d Remus breathed, \u201cI\u2026 you\u2019re such a good mate, and\u2026\u201d\nOh shit. He shouldn\u2019t have said \u2018mate\u2019.\nMate\nwas the worst possible word. He could practically see Christopher\u2019s heart break. But only for a moment, before that pureblood, stiff-upper-lip took over. He shook his head, stepped back.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Honestly. I\u2019d rather be friends than not, if that\u2019s all we can be.\u201d\nRemus ached.\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Christopher smiled, as if nothing had happened. \u201cIt\u2019s steak and kidney pie tonight, your favourite.\u201d\nThey left the classroom - just the two of them - and Remus quietly closed the door behind him, to avoid suspicion."

            "content": "Sirius didn\u2019t show up for dinner. Emmeline wandered over and asked James where he was, but James just shrugged,\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, \u201cWe were on a mission earlier, but I lost track of him. Hope Filch never caught him\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd why would Filch be looking for Sirius?\u201d Lily asked, setting down her knife and for and giving James a very direct look.\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know.\u201d James said quickly, staring at his mashed potato as if it was the most fascinating thing in the world. Twenty minutes later, the prefects were summoned to an emergency meeting to discuss a problem on the fifth floor - all of the suits of armour had apparently begun singing opera.\n\n\nAll of the students were ordered to their common rooms for the rest of the evening, and when Peter, Remus, Marlene and Mary reached the tower, they found Sirius there, sitting in front of the fireplace, smoking.\n\n\nWhere did he get the fags?\n\n\nRemus wondered.\n\n\nHe usually asks me.\n\n\nSirius Black was not the type to buy his own cigarettes; he was a professional borrower.\n\n\n\u201cAlright, Black?\u201d Mary asked, cheerfully.\n\n\n\u201cYeah fine.\u201d Sirius grunted, still staring at the fire.\n\n\n\u201cWeren\u2019t hungry?\u201d She asked.\n\n\n\u201cNope.\u201d He inhaled and puffed out, like a restless dragon.\n\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Mary raised knowing eyebrow, and looked at the others, \u201cIn one of your moods, I see.\u201d\n\n\nHe did not respond to this. Remus often forgot how well Mary knew Sirius. He admired the breezy, no-nonsense way she dealt with him; his own instinct was often to coddle and give in. He ought to take a leaf out of Mary\u2019s book, he thought.\n\n\nWhen Christopher returned from the prefect\u2019s meeting, Remus stuck to him like glue for as long as possible. Partly because he knew he had hurt him, and he wanted to show him that nothing had changed. Partly because he knew that Sirius wouldn\u2019t come anywhere near them while they were together. They sat on the window seat at the back of the room, furthest from the fireplace. It was the same place Sirius had sat with Remus only a few months ago, where they\u2019d argued, then made up. But he wasn\u2019t thinking about it. He was listening to Christopher\u2019s rundown of the prefect\u2019s briefing,\n\n\n\u201c...and everybody\n\n\nknows\n\n\nPotter probably had something to do with it, but obviously there\u2019s no proof because he\u2019s basically a professional vandal, and everyone loves him, so he gets away with it. Even Lily Evans has given up, she never takes him to task like she used to.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, really?\u201d Remus feigned interest, watching the back of Sirius\u2019s armchair.\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Christopher nodded, \u201cShe\u2019s gone soft on him. I even asked her what she thought should be done to punish the pranksters, and she actually giggled! She said it was actually quite funny, and as it hadn\u2019t hurt anyone that I should lighten up! I used to really look up to her, you know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe you should lighten up,\u201d Remus sighed, \u201cIt does sound like it was funny. God knows we could all do with a laugh.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPrefects are supposed to uphold\n\n\nall\n\n\nof the rules,\u201d Christopher replied, an echo of McGonagall in his voice, \u201cNot just the boring ones. Anyway, if that\u2019s how you feel, I don\u2019t know why I bother.\u201d\n\n\nHe started to get up,\n\n\n\u201cChris,\u201d Remus looked up at him, \u201cC\u2019mon, don\u2019t be like that. I\u2019ll quiz you on Runes if you like.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like it.\u201d Christopher replied, snippily, \u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201d He walked off, towards the dorms. Remus sighed again, and rubbed his eyes. He\u2019d give it a few minutes then go up himself. It had been a trying sort of day.\n\n\nBut of course, it wasn\u2019t over. No sooner had Remus brushed his teeth and changed into his pyjamas, than Sirius had taken his opportunity. He was standing in the middle of the dorm room with a face like thunder, arms folded. Remus felt at a bit of a disadvantage, in his night things and bare feet, but he tried to remain stoic and nodded.\n\n\n\u201cHello, Sirius. I\u2019m just going to bed.\u201d He tried to walk towards his side of the room, but Sirius blocked him.\n\n\n\u201cYou really pissed me off, you know that?\u201d He said, furiously.\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Remus reeled back, frowning. Sirius carried on, practically ranting.\n\n\n\u201cIf you were trying to make me jealous, then I think it\u2019s really bloody low of you, Remus.\u201d\n\n\nRemus rolled his eyes, which he knew would rile Sirius up even more.\n\n\n\u201cOh,\n\n\nof course\n\n\n.\u201d He said, sarcastically, \u201cEverything\u2019s about\n\n\nyou\n\n\n, isn\u2019t it? For god\u2019s sake, you weren\u2019t even supposed to be there! Why didn\u2019t you just leave with the rest of the group?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d want to go down to dinner together! How was I supposed to know you\u2019ve been having secret trysts with that\u2026 that...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been having \u2018secret trysts\u2019 with anyone but\n\n\nyou\n\n\n, you idiot.\u201d Remus spat, \u201cAnd you\u2019ve already made me regret that. Christopher is my friend, and either way it\u2019s none of your bloody business, so keep your nose out!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine!\u201d Sirius shouted, \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI said so, didn\u2019t I?!\u201d\n\n\nRemus was furious, so angry that he knew if he stayed much longer he\u2019d say something he regretted. They both liked the last word in an argument, it was one of the only ways they were similar. As he had nowhere to go, he pushed past Sirius to his bed, and shut the curtains so vigorously that he almost ripped the rings from the frame.\n\n\nIn a few moments, he heard Sirius\u2019s angry footsteps stomping back down the stairs.\n\n\nWell,\n\n\nRemus thought.\n\n\nIf he didn\u2019t get the message before, he\u2019s got it now.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nMonday 4th April 1977\n\n\nInconveniently enough, the very first Apparition lesson of the year happened to fall on the April full moon. Remus was already intensely nervous - in that shaky, sweaty sort of way - about these lessons; add to that the challenge he usually had keeping his magic under control in the days preceding the moon, and he was sure it was a recipe for disaster.\n\n\n\u201cI might end up on the other side of the country!\u201d He said in a low voice to Lily as they queued up outside the Great Hall.\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI asked Professor McGonagall; they\u2019ve only lifted the anti-apparition measures on the hall, so I don\u2019t think you can get outside it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally? Ok, that\u2019s good.\u201d He nodded, trying to calm himself. It had been unendingly useful, having Lily aware of the furry little problem. She was much better at common sense than James or Sirius.\n\n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d she whispered, \u201cYou should stop acting like it\u2019s a bad thing, being extra strong sometimes. I\u2019d have thought it was an advantage, especially for someone as clever as you.\u201d\n\n\nThat struck him in a funny way. No one had ever suggested he try to be positive about his problem before. Well, except for Livia.\n\n\nYou don\u2019t know half of the power you hold, Remus Lupin.\n\n\n\nInside the hall, Professor McGonagall introduced the eager sixth and seventh years to the tall, spindly ministry official who was there to teach them apparition. Remus had, of course, done a fair bit of reading on the subject, and already knew about the \u2018three d\u2019s\u2019, but he had rather hoped there would be more to it than that.\n\n\nAfter much too little instruction, in Remus\u2019s opinion, the students were given wooden hoops, asked to simply \u2018have a go\u2019. He caught Mary\u2019s eye, as they carried their hoops to a free space. She pulled a bug-eyed face and he laughed, which earned a stern look from the instructor. Not wanting to make a bad impression, Remus re-focussed his attention on the hoop.\n\n\nIt was very difficult to concentrate, when everyone around you was twirling on the spot, tripping and stumbling, like puppies being trained to roll over. Still, Remus closed his eyes and tried.\n\n\n\nDeliberation.\n\n\nBest not to take it too fast; like flying a broom. Slow and steady wins the race.\n\n\n\nDetermination\n\n\n. He really, really wanted to beat Sirius.\n\n\n\nDestination\n\n\n. The hoop wasn\u2019t even that far away. He\u2019d side-alonged further, that time with Mr Potter.\n\n\nRemus tried to recall how that had felt. The magic, pulling him forward - no, more like\u2026 more like following a channel, like water swirling down a bathtub drain; if you pressed your fingertips against the holes you could feel the vacuum sucking\u2026 it was a bit like that.\n\n\n\u201cBOLLOCKS!\u201d A shout went up, causing a lapse in Remus\u2019s concentration. He opened his eyes in time to see James and Sirius sitting dazed on floor, staring at each other confused, rubbing their heads.\n\n\nOh no,\n\n\nRemus thought,\n\n\ndid they do it, already?\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIdiots.\u201d Mary laughed. Everyone else was laughing too, and Sirius was looking extremely put out, as he climbed to his feet and dusted off his robes with a dignified sniff.\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Remus asked.\n\n\n\u201cThey both jumped at the same time and hit each other.\u201d She snorted. \u201cSilly buggers. I\u2019m not feeling anything, are you?\u201d\n\n\nRemus shook his head. He closed his eyes again and concentrated as hard as he could, feeling for whatever it was that would pull him in the right way. He thought he had it, tried twirling, but got nowhere. At least he didn\u2019t fall over.\n\n\nSomething wasn\u2019t right. This was like the stupid patronus thing all over again (he still hadn\u2019t managed one; he was one of the only ones who hadn\u2019t. Even\n\n\nPeter\n\n\nhad produced a wispy bit of silver.) Only the trick to that was having a happy thought - and Remus accepted that happy thoughts were not his forte.\n\n\nThis\n\n\n, however,\n\n\nthis\n\n\nrequired determination. And wasn\u2019t he determined?\n\n\nJust then, the ministry sanctioned apparition instructor wafted past, and Remus caught a whiff of his magic. It was peculiar and strong - buzzing. It reminded him of the way that the old TV in the rec room at St Edmund\u2019s gathered a fuzz of static on the screen. As a child, Remus had held his hands up to it in wonder, and stroked the bizarre, otherworldly energy, as if he could absorb it\n\n\nThere was a snap in Remus\u2019s mind, like ice cracking. That was it! Remus relaxed his body. He didn\u2019t have to\n\n\nlook\n\n\nfor the right channel, or try to feel it out - he could\n\n\nalready\n\n\nfeel it. The room was full of magic, thick and iron-like and hot-cold against his teeth. He could always sense it, he just learnt to tune it out over the years. That was harder to do on a full moon, but in this scenario, that might not be a disadvantage, as Lily had said\u2026\n\n\nHe closed his eyes, breathed in, and moved - it felt like only the slightest twitch, a wand flick, or the quirk of an eyebrow. He let the magic do all the work, and when he opened his eyes with a gasp, he was inside the hoop.\n\n\n\u201cBravo!\u201d The instructor was clapping his spindly hands together delicately, noiselessly.\n\n\n\u201cNice one, Moony!\u201d James called across the room, a large, egg shaped bruised growing on his forehead.\n\n\n\u201cWell\n\n\ndone\n\n\n, Remus!\u201d The girls cheered.\n\n\nRemus looked at his feet, embarrassed, but thrilled.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nFriday 15th April 1977\n\n\nBy mid-April, there seemed to be no limits to Remus\u2019s newfound confidence. He was cautious about it, of course - he didn\u2019t tell anybody (perish the thought!) in case they might think him arrogant, or even worse - dangerous. But he knew that something had changed. For many years now, Remus had considered his lycanthropy, and the uncontrollable feelings and senses which arose from it, as a limitation on his magic. If the past few weeks were anything to go by - this had been incorrect.\n\n\nPerhaps this misunderstanding was simply due to the fact that too little study had been done on werewolves in the wizarding world. Or perhaps Livia had been right - Remus had been instructed by the wrong people all along.\n\n\nNow, in private, he carried out various experiments, from simple, basic spells, to much more complex transfiguration and transmutation. All of them came much easier when he relaxed, when he harnessed whatever magic was already there in the space around him. Before, casting a spell had felt like drawing water up from a well inside him, a heavy bucket on a winch. After the apparition discovery, he felt as though he had been standing in a lake all along - and all he needed to do was drink. He had even begun to make steps towards wordless magic.\n\n\nIn the meantime, he had exams to prepare for, and while his newfound strength would certainly be useful in his practical exams, Remus still had to complete several witten papers. On this particular afternoon, he had convinced James (and by extension, Peter) to revise along with him. It was a bright spring day, and the last chills of winter had eked out enough that they all agreed with would be nice to sit outside for a change.\n\n\nThey sprawled on the grass, books open, James reading with his tongue between his teeth and a quill behind his ear, Peter half-heartedly jotting down notes on hinkypunks.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d he whinged, \u201cIt\u2019s not NEWTs or OWLs this year, why\u2019ve we got to do exams at all?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t want you to lose your edge, Wormy,\u201d James replied, still engrossed in his book. \u201cThink of it as practice for NEWTs.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRather not.\u201d Peter pulled a face. \u201cMoony, do you have the notes for--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays.\u201d Remus said, promptly, not looking up from his DADA essay.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter scratched his head.\n\n\n\u201cTuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays.\u201d Remus repeated. \u201cThose are the days I hold my study groups, and\n\n\nthose\n\n\nare the days I help other people with their work. I need the rest of the time to catch up with my own stuff.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, but I\u2019m your\n\n\nbest friend\n\n\n,\u201d Peter moaned, \u201cPleeease, Moony?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLess time snogging Dorcas, more time organising your notes.\u201d Remus smirked. It was very easy to be pious when you weren\u2019t allowed to snog the people you wanted to snog. Speaking of which.\n\n\n\u201cAll right, lads?\u201d Sirius came sauntering across the lawn towards them, Emmeline trotting along behind him. James looked up and grinned, Peter moved to make a space.\n\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019ve you been?\u201d James asked, \u201cNever see you these days.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot my fault you\u2019ve become\n\n\none of them\n\n\n, prefect Potter.\u201d Sirius replied, coolly, \u201cI had detention.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in detention more often than I\u2019m doing anything prefect-ish,\u201d James countered, no longer reading his book, now back in marauder mode. He nodded at Emmeline, who sat primly beside Sirius, smoothing her skirt down, \u201cAll right, Em?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHi James,\u201d she smiled back at him, \u201cPeter, Remus. Are you all revising?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Peter groaned. \u201cMoony\u2019s not helping me, though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, help yourself, for once,\u201d Remus snapped, no longer lightly teasing.\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Emmeline said, encouragingly, \u201cGet it out of the way before Hogsmeade this weekend. I think it\u2019s responsible, don\u2019t you, Sirius?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cS\u2019pose.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSpeaking of,\u201d she continued, ignoring his brush off, \u201cWhat do you fancy doing in Hogsmeade? Will I meet you there, or will you pick me up outside my common room?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUgh, I dunno. Why\u2019s it have to be a big deal?\u201d\n\n\nPeter, despite his earlier despair, suddenly became fascinated by his DADA notes, head bowed over the parchment.\n\n\n\u201cOther boys don\u2019t mind making plans to take their girlfriends out,\u201d Emmeline said, her voice edging on shrill. This was clearly old ground for them.\n\n\nLike Peter, James and Remus began to concentrate on their books and notes as if their lives depended on it. Sirius and Emmeline carried on bickering regardless.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not other boys,\u201d Sirius growled, \u201cI thought you liked that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo did I.\u201d She shot back.\n\n\n\u201cSo, what? I\u2019m a terrible boyfriend because I don\u2019t want to trail around after you like some soppy git?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking and you know it!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStop complaining then.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not compl--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSounds like it. Moan moan moan.\u201d\n\n\nEmmeline opened and closed her mouth a few times, clearly wanting to say something back, but not wanting it to sound like moaning. Finally, she sat in silence, staring at the ground. Her eyes looked a bit brighter than usual, and Remus finally felt himself softening towards her. Poor girl.\n\n\n\u201cOh\n\n\nMerlin\n\n\n, don\u2019t sulk.\u201d Sirius complained at her silence. \u201cIf you\u2019re angry then let's have a fight, if you\u2019re ok then give us a snog \u2013 but\n\n\nplease\n\n\ndon\u2019t sulk.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUgh, and those are the only two options with you, aren\u2019t they, Sirius?!\u201d Emmeline snapped, climbing to her feet and folding her arms across her chest.\n\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d He replied, grinning that Sirius Black grin.\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d She threw her hands up and stormed away, back towards the castle.\n\n\nOnce she was gone, there was only the uncomfortable silence left. James cleared his throat.\n\n\n\u201cNot very nice, Pads.\u201d He said over his textbook. \u201cShe\u2019s upset now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s always upset,\u201d Sirius whined, \u201cWhat about\n\n\nmy\n\n\nfeelings?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not convinced you have any.\u201d James said, without missing a beat. \u201cWhat do you think, Moony?\u201d\n\n\nRemus glanced up from his own book, hoping he looked harassed and uninterested \u2013 as if he hadn\u2019t been paying rapt attention.\n\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoes Padfoot have feelings?\u201d\n\n\nSirius caught his eye. Remus straightened his back, looked away.\n\n\n\u201cDefinitely not.\u201d\n\n\nSirius stood up without a word, and left.\n\n\n\u201cSirius? Oi!\u201d James stood, but Sirius did not look back. James scratched his head, sitting back down uneasily. He was thoughtful for a moment before looking at Remus. \u201cMoony\u2026 is something going on between you two?\u201d\n\n\nRemus glared at him.\n\n\n\u201cAsk him!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI did. He won\u2019t say anything.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\u2026really?\u201d Remus was genuinely surprised. He\u2019d been half certain Sirius had told him every filthy detail. He must really be ashamed.\n\n\n\u201cReally.\u201d James was looking at him very intensely now, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I slept with Mary.\u201d At least it was true. Peter made an odd sort gasp, beside him, but Remus ignored it. \u201cHe found out, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 what?!\u201d James eyebrows shot up in unmasked surprise. He quickly rearranged his features, clearing his throat, \u201cOh, well good on you, mate. I had no idea you and she\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust a one off thing.\u201d Remus said, quickly.\n\n\n\u201cOk. Right, well. Why\u2019s Sirius in a mood about it? He and Mary broke up ages ago.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus replied, glumly. He sighed, \u201cOh, go on then, Pete, borrow my notes. Which bit are you stuck on?\u201d"

            "content": "The quidditch stands on a Sunday were one of the only places you were guaranteed some peace and quiet at Hogwarts. Remus had been going there every week since his birthday to catch the tail end of James\u2019s spartan training sessions, and to have a flying lesson of his own, afterwards.\n\n\nThis morning, however, as he limped into the stands, he found that he was not alone.\n\n\n\u201cHiya, Lily,\u201d Remus beamed, surprised, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\n\nLily spun around and blinked at him, mouth open in a small pink \u2018O\u2019, as if she had not expected anyone else. Her eyes darted to the pitch, then back to Remus nervously, and she gave a sheepish grin,\n\n\n\u201cHi! Er\u2026 just watching Marls practice. Moral support and all that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, right. Mind if I join you?\u201d\n\n\nShe smiled and shifted her bag, as if to make room for him, though the stands were completely empty. They sat quietly and watched the practice for a bit. James was drilling the chasers and the keeper, so only half the team was there today. Remus vaguely remembered James\u2019s \u2018focus sessions\u2019 initiative, which had come as a relief to the rest of the Gryffindor team, as it meant they didn\u2019t\n\n\nactually\n\n\nhave to practice every day, even if James did.\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 Lily?\u201d Remus said, after a while, \u201cDid you know that Marlene isn\u2019t practicing today?\u201d\n\n\nShe looked down at her knees, her hair falling in a coppery sheet in front of her face.\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d She whispered.\n\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re here to watch\u2026?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me\n\n\nsay it\n\n\n, Remus,\u201d she sounded defeated. She raised her head, pushing her hair behind her ear, \u201cGo on then, let me have it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Remus was amused. Prefect Lily Evans, all come undone. Sirius would love it.\n\n\n\u201cTease me, make fun of me, tell me I\u2019m a complete idiot\u2026\u201d she sighed, looking out at the pitch, \u201cI already know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an idiot just for fancying James.\u201d Remus laughed, nudging her jovially, \u201cBut\u2026 I mean, it is a\n\n\nbit\n\n\nfunny, after all this time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUgh, I know.\u201d She groaned, \u201cI can\u2019t bloody believe it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoes he know?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d She stared at him in disbelief, \u201cI\u2019d absolutely\n\n\ndie\n\n\n!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy?!\u201d Remus laughed again, \u201cYou don\u2019t honestly think he\u2019ll turn you down? He\u2019s been hoping for this\n\n\nexact thing\n\n\nfor five years!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d She said, gesturing wildly with her hands, spreading out her fingers in a show of exasperation. \u201cHe\u2019s wanted it forever, and I\u2019ve only wanted it for\u2026 er\u2026 well maybe a little while, actually\u2026 but nowhere near as long. If I give in now, he\u2019s so\n\n\nintense\n\n\n. I might break his heart.\u201d\n\n\nShe bit her lip, still watching him flying, blowing his whistle and pointing emphatically at the goal rings.\n\n\n\u201cYou might.\u201d Remus agreed, \u201cBut I think James Potter would consider it an honour to have his heart broken by you.\u201d\n\n\nShe snorted,\n\n\n\u201cRemus, honestly, you sound as bad as he does. I\u2019m not this\u2026 I dunno, perfect \u2018dream girl\u2019 who\u2019s going breeze into his life and make all the crap stuff wonderful. It\u2019s not a fairytale.\n\n\nI\u2019m\n\n\nnot a fairytale. I\u2019m really annoying. I\u2019m a complete mess in the mornings - ask Mary - and I hate losing arguments, and I shout when I\u2019m angry, and my nose runs when I cry. I don\u2019t know anything about quidditch and I don\u2019t\n\n\nreally\n\n\nwant to learn, either.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d Remus smiled. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he knows most of that. If he doesn\u2019t then I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll hurt for him to find out. Anyway, it\u2019s not as if James is perfect. I\u2019ve smelled his socks.\u201d\n\n\nLily laughed.\n\n\n\u201cThanks, Remus.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGoing to tell him?\u201d\n\n\nShe wrinkled her freckled nose.\n\n\n\u201cNah. Want to think about it a bit more first.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust going to stare at him riding his broom for hours on end?\u201d\n\n\nShe shoved him, laughing,\n\n\n\u201cIf I want to! He\u2019s easy on the eye, what can I say?\u201d She poked out her tongue and returned to gawping. Remus smiled, and dredged up the only real piece of advice he had.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave it too long. It gets harder, the longer you wait.\u201d\n\n\nLily looked at him, curiously, and Remus instantly regretted saying anything.\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d She said, \u201cYou seem very wise in the ways of love, all of a sudden.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNah.\u201d He laughed, he hoped convincingly, \u201cI just read lots.\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\u201cI could have given you all of my heart,\n\n\n\n\nBut there\u2019s someone who\u2019s torn it apart.\n\n\n\n\nAnd he\u2019s taken nearly all that I have got,\n\n\n\n\nBut if you want I\u2019ll try to love again\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBlack, next time you decide to break someone\u2019s heart, can you do it\n\n\noutside\n\n\nof the exam period?\u201d Lily groaned as Sirius entered the common room and every radio, turntable and gramophone within twenty metres began blaring PP Arnold\u2019s tragedy stricken voice.\n\n\n\n\u201cBaby I\u2019ll try to love again, but I know\u2026\n\n\n\n\nThe first cut is the deepest\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you want me to do about it?!\u201d Sirius raged, storming about the room, trying to mute every speaker in sight.\n\n\nIt had been a painful, drawn out melodrama, but Emmeline and Sirius had finally split. And apparently\n\n\nnobody\n\n\ntreated Emmeline Vance like that, so in retaliation, she had placed a very advanced hex on him, which meant that every time he entered a room breakup songs began to play. This was usually limited to music players, but occasionally, when there was nothing else about, the portraits had begun to burst into song too.\n\n\n\u201cJust apologise to her and get the bloody spell lifted!\u201d Lily replied.\n\n\n\n\u201cCuz when it comes to being lucky, he\u2019s cursed,\n\n\n\n\nwhen it comes to lovin\u2019 me, he\u2019s worst\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to apologise for!\u201d He spat back, forcefully, \u201c\n\n\nSilencio\n\n\n!\n\n\nSilencio silencio\n\n\n,\n\n\nSILENCIO\n\n\n!\u201d\n\n\nThe music finally stopped. Who knew for how long. Remus didn\u2019t get involved, he could only make it worse, and Sirius had been in a foul mood all week.\n\n\n\u201cGot to give it to the girl,\u201d Mary mused. \u201cShe\u2019s creative.\u201d She was straddling Marlene, who lay on her front on the rug, Mary plaiting her long blonde hair. Every time she got to the end, she would unravel it all, comb it out gently, and begin again. Sometimes Remus didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever understand girls. Still, Marlene, who usually hated being fussed over, seemed to be quite enjoying it, she looked very peaceful.\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah, go on, take her side, you lot. Bloody women.\u201d Sirius threw himself into the armchair opposite Lily and slouched into it, glaring at the fire. \u201cAnyone got a fag?\u201d\n\n\nRemus did, but he didn\u2019t say anything.\n\n\n\u201cNot surprised she dumped you,\u201d Mary grinned, \u201cYou\u2019re a miserable git these days. I\u2019m well shot of you.\u201d She gave him a joking wink, and his frown diminished.\n\n\n\u201cYou love me really,\u201d he muttered.\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about something else.\u201d Marlene said, from the floor. \u201cNot exams or bloody relationships. Potter, what\u2019s going on with this camping trip?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAll sorted - you lot just need to show up,\u201d James grinned, \u201cWith your tents, obviously.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDad says I can borrow the family ones, as long as I take care of them,\u201d Lily said, \u201cTwo two-sleepers.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCosy.\u201d Sirius said, sarcastically, \u201cWith seven of us going.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEight,\u201d Peter piped up, \u201cJames said I could bring Dorcas.\u201d\n\n\nRemus groaned inwardly at that. Not that he didn\u2019t like Dorcas; Dorcas was fine. But he had been looking forward to a summer holiday with all of his closest friends, not tag-alongs. Thank goodness Mary wasn\u2019t bringing her latest boyfriend. Though, with Mary, the turnover was too fast to make any kind of long term plans.\n\n\n\u201cWell I was rather hoping that you boys would bring your own tent, actually.\u201d Lily replied, giving Sirius a frosty look.\n\n\n\u201cMum said in her last letter that there\u2019s a muggle camping supply shop in our village,\u201d James said, quickly, ever the peacemaker, \u201cSo we\u2019ll all go at get ours as soon as we\u2019re home. You\u2019re definitely coming to stay, this summer, right Moony?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s still ok?\u201d Remus asked, anxiously. He still didn\u2019t have a plan b. Maybe James would let him keep one of the tents afterwards. Ugh, what a depressing thought.\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d James grinned magnanimously, rubbing his hands together, \u201cThis summer is going to be\n\n\ngreat\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow are we getting to Cornwall?\u201d Marlene asked. \u201cApparating?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve all passed, yeah.\u201d\n\n\nThey looked at Peter, guiltily. He\u2019d still not quite managed to get anywhere without splinching himself, yet.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really trying,\u201d he said, embarrassed. \u201cI could get the Knight Bus?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d James said, cheerily. \u201cI promise. Best summer ever.\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nMother\n\n\n\n\nYou had me\n\n\n\n\nBut I never had you\n\n\n\n\nI wanted you\n\n\n\n\nYou didn\u2019t want me.\n\n\n\n\nFriday 24th June 1977\n\n\nAnd really, Remus thought to himself, as he left his last exam of the term - Care of Magical Creatures, written - thank goodness for James\u2019s eternal optimism. It was one of the only things that kept any of them going, these days.\n\n\nExams were the same as they ever had been - easier, maybe, at least when it came to practical magic. Fortunately no one expected a patronus this year. There was something reassuring about a timetable, though, and deadlines and timed exercises. It all made good common sense, and didn\u2019t encourage too much independent thought. Remus was always grateful for an opportunity to switch off his brain. Especially as he had set himself a very personal deadline of his own.\n\n\nOnce his final exam was over (and today was the day), he would open the shoebox. It had been sitting under his bed for the better part of three months now. He had not so much as glanced at it. Whatever was in it would be disruptive, he knew that. Even if it was nothing more than some boring notes from Matron, old school work or something, he knew that just thinking about the whole St Edmund\u2019s problem was going to drag him down eventually. He told himself that it was very sensible and mature; he needed a clear head for exams.\n\n\nBut it was late June now, and he had nothing left to do. Of course, there was always\n\n\nsomething\n\n\nto do - NEWTs would begin in earnest next year; he ought to get a head start. There was talk about an end of year party, and he could start preparing for that. He really ought to catch up on his reading for Madam Pomfrey\u2019s healing classes, too; he was woefully behind on bruises.\n\n\nHe ate lunch first. Unpleasant experiences were generally better faced on a full stomach. There were exams scheduled that afternoon for Muggle Studies and Divination - both of which James and Sirius were taking.\n\n\n\u201cMoony, what are hot air balloons for? I still don\u2019t get it\u2026\u201d James pleaded, looking very frazzled.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Lily said, pouring herself some pumpkin juice, \u201cMuggle Studies should be easy for you, after advanced Transfiguration.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWow, thanks Evans,\u201d James beamed. Everyone looked at Lily, who blushed and returned to her food.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve still never seen anything in a crystal ball.\u201d Peter sighed deeply.\n\n\n\u201cTell her you see a grim,\u201d Sirius said, cheerfully, \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy a grim?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI just have a feeling she might actually see one, tomorrow afternoon, at about two o\u2019clock.\u201d Sirius smirked. James and Peter began to laugh, much to the girls\u2019 confusion.\n\n\nRemus loitered outside the Great Hall for as long as he could with his friends, until they all had to go in for the exam.\n\n\nPutting it off a few minutes won\u2019t hurt...\n\n\n\nBut eventually, it was time to face the music. After all, the sooner he did it, the longer he\u2019d have by himself to actually process it. Even if it was nothing; even if he only had to cope with another disappointment. He had a good book on hand, and full access to Sirius\u2019s record collection, so the afternoon didn\u2019t have to be completely unpleasant.\n\n\nHe drew the curtains around his bed, even though he was alone in the dorm room. He blew the dust from the cardboard lid, and it made him cough.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nScourgify\n\n\n,\u201d he choked, aiming his wand at his sheets to rid them of the nasty grey matter. No going back now. As quickly as ripping off a plaster, he lifted the lid.\n\n\nAt first, it all looked completely harmless. Everything inside was flat - papers, presumably, sorted into neat brown envelopes of varying sizes, varying ages.\n\n\nHis admission papers to St Edmund\u2019s -\n\n\nRemus John Lupin, 5 years 3 months, arrival date 12/07/1965.\n\n\nReports written by his primary school teachers - all of the marks were \u2018poor\u2019.\n\n\n\u2018Shows very little aptitude for academia\u2019\n\n\n, one read,\n\n\n\u2018Incapable of learning. May suit unskilled work.\n\n\n\u2019 Fucking bitches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis birth certificate. It was a muggle one - he supposed his mother had not been admitted to St. Mungo\u2019s. Remus learnt that he had been born at home, in Bristol, of all places. His mother\u2019s name was Hope, and his father was listed as \u2018Unemployed\u2019. All of this, Remus worked through with impassive patience, like an archivist sifting through documents relating to some ancient history, not his own life. But then came the photographs.\n\n\nThey were black and white. Muggle; unmoving. One of a chubby baby dressed in some white knitted affair, with buttons shaped like bunny rabbits. Remus supposed it was him, there was nothing written on the back, only the stamp from Boots. There was another, which must have been taken when he arrived at St Edmund\u2019s. In it, he was able to recognise some features - the dark, cautious stare, the mouth set in a determined grimace. He was looking up - at whoever was taking the photo, presumably - and he looked frightened.\n\n\nThe last picture was the worst. It was of a family he did not remember.\n\n\nThere was Lyall, tall and slim and gangly, tousled hair and small, wire framed spectacles. He was smiling - Remus never pictured him smiling. Sitting in a floral armchair beside him was a small, very young looking woman. She had immaculate platinum blonde hair in a proper sixties beehive, and she was wearing a neat shirtwaister which showed off her pretty figure. Her nose was a bit long and beakish, but she had a nice face. On her lap was a little boy, giggling, his face all creased up with joy. She was looking at him, her mouth was open - what had she been saying?\n\n\nRemus put it down, feeling light headed. He realised he\u2019d been holding his breath for a long time, and exhaled. There was one envelope left. The handwriting on it was not Matron\u2019s. It hadn\u2019t been sealed, though, so maybe she\u2019d read it before. Maybe that\u2019s why she hadn\u2019t given it to him. Steeling himself once more, Remus pulled out a letter, folded neatly in thirds. It was written on pretty note paper with a floral design at the borders. The handwriting was pretty, too.\n\n\n\nMy darling boy,\n\n\n\n\nI know I\u2019ve no right to leave you this letter. It may be a good few years before you receive it - if you receive it at all. I hope that you do, and I hope that when you do, you\u2019ll be old enough. Still, I don\u2019t expect forgiveness.\n\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t think what to tell you. How can I explain? You were my beautiful, precious boy from the moment you were born. No - from the moment I felt you move inside me. Your father and I loved each other very much, and having you tripled our happiness a thousand times over. You were loved, my little Remus, I pray you haven\u2019t forgotten it. But you\u2019re very young, and they tell me that sometimes forgetting is kindest.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the accident happened, I promised you I would do everything I could to make it right again. I had some stupid idea that just loving you would be enough.\n\n\n\n\nThen when Lyall left us both, I tried for you. I swear tried. But I was never a very clever girl, and never as strong or practical as your father. You needed so much, and I had so little. I had no family once I married him, you see, they told me to make a choice. My parents didn\u2019t approve, and even after he\u2019d gone, I knew they wouldn\u2019t approve of you.\n\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t say how sorry I am, to let you go. In my heart I know it\u2019s the safest thing, and the best for you, in the end. I know I will never forget you, and I know I will always long to see you again. I pray that when the time comes, I shall not be difficult for you to find.\n\n\n\n\nAll my love,\n\n\n\n\nHope Jenkins.\n\n\n\nRemus put the letter back in the envelope and closed the box. He threw the box under the bed. He climbed underneath his heavy covers and curled up small, like he used to at St Edmund\u2019s. He felt as if a hole had been opened up inside of him, a big, gaping emptiness. Tears picked his eyes, and because he was alone, he let them come.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nSaturday 2nd July 1977\n\n\nHe\u2019d never given his mother much thought. At least, not since he\u2019d been at Hogwarts, which seemed so full of Lyall and all his achievements and mistakes. Obviously it would have been better to have a mother than not, but he wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d been missing all that time. Matron hadn\u2019t been very maternal, but she wasn\u2019t paid to love the boys she looked after.\n\n\nThis window into Hope\u2019s life - into his\n\n\nown\n\n\nlife - was terrifying to Remus, and he wished he\u2019d never read the stupid letter. Still, he read it more than once. He read it every night, for the rest of the term, as if reading the word \u2018loved\u2019 could make him feel it. It couldn\u2019t.\n\n\nThe marauders stayed an extra two nights at Hogwarts, for Remus\u2019s sake. The first full moon of the summer fell on the 1st July, and it was more convenient (not to menton safer for the Potters) if Remus spent it in the Shrieking Shack. Well, he was\n\n\nsupposed\n\n\nto be in the Shrieking Shack, but of course Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs had other ideas. Free of exams and excited about the summer, they had one of the best full moon nights they\u2019d had in ages.\n\n\nStill, Madam Pomfrey insisted on the usual course of aftercare, and knocked Remus out with a strong sleeping draught to ensure he rested through the next morning,\n\n\n\u201cTravelling by floo powder can make you queasy at the best of times,\u201d she cautioned, \u201cBetter safe than sorry.\u201d\n\n\nThey were due to travel that evening, using the fireplace in McGonagall's office. Remus woke up just after lunch, and found he was not alone.\n\n\n\u201cHiya, Moony,\u201d Sirius said, softly, sitting in the chair by his bed. His eyes were dark, he looked as though he had been dozing, too.\n\n\n\u201cHiya,\u201d Remus echoed, sitting up, stretching, \u201cYou ought to be in bed, you look knackered.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up, I look gorgeous,\u201d Sirius replied, yawning. \u201cAnyway, James is tearing the bedroom apart trying to pack, I wouldn\u2019t get any sleep. Hungry?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAlways.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood, I\u2019m supposed to make sure you eat,\u201d he motioned to a plate sitting on the bedside table, loaded with fruit and sandwiches. Remus picked up an apple and bit into it, ravenous.\n\n\nNeither of them said much for a while, but Sirius ate a few grapes. Since March, they had perfected the art of making small talk with as little detail or eye contact as possible. You could call it a friendship, if you didn\u2019t know what had come before.\n\n\n\u201cI feel a bit bad.\u201d Sirius said, out of the blue, looking at his shoelaces.\n\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI feel a bit bad about the way I spoke to you, a while ago. About your friend er\u2026 Christopher?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus finished his apple core, down the the stem, which he put down, reaching for a sandwich next. Cheese and pickle. \u201cYou were a bit rude, but it\u2019s ok. I haven\u2019t thought about it much.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s good.\u201d Sirius nodded. He looked at Remus, then quickly diverted his gaze out of the window. \u201cI thought maybe\u2026 I thought he might be the reason you decided to stop.\u201d\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t need to ask what he meant. Sirius was being very clear.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus said, choosing his words carefully. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t to do with him. I told you, he\u2019s my friend, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\nSirius nodded, bravely.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I believe you. I do.\u201d\n\n\nHe still didn\u2019t understand, Remus realised, sadly. He still didn\u2019t know why they couldn\u2019t just carry on the way they were. Stupid, beautiful, impossible boy.\n\n\n\u201cLook, Sirius,\u201d he said, still cautious, \u201cI just\u2026 I\u2019ve had a bit of a shit year, to be honest. Maybe I\u2019m having a shit life, I dunno. There\u2019s a lot of stuff going on at the moment that I can\u2019t really control. So the way I see it... if something\u2019s making me miserable that I\n\n\ncan\n\n\ncontrol, then\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, right. I get it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI would never want to make you miserable, Moony.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not what I meant.\n\n\nRemus thought,\n\n\nThat\u2019s not what I wanted to say\n\n\n. But he didn\u2019t have the energy for more. Didn\u2019t have the resources. It would have to do, at least until everything stopped being so raw.\n\n\n\u201cAre those voices I hear?\u201d Madam Pomfrey came bustling around the hospital curtain, merry and rosy cheeked, \u201cWell! You\u2019re looking much better. Looking forward to summer, boys?\u201d"

            "content": "Television man is crazy, saying we\u2019re juvenile delinquent wrecks,\n\n\nOh man! I need TV, when I got T.Rex!\n\n\nRemus felt strangely untethered, arriving at the Potter\u2019s with all of his earthly possessions, moving them into a temporary room. He was going to have to tell\nsomebody\nwhat had happened \u2013 and soon. If he could just get Mr Potter on his own, maybe\u2026 but both of James\u2019s parents were busier than ever this year, running in and out of the house on errands, or holding secretive meetings which the boys weren\u2019t allowed to attend.\n\u201cBut we\u2019re all\nof age\n,\u201d James protested.\n\u201cYou\u2019re still my little boy, though,\u201d Mrs Potter kissed his head, patronisingly, as she cleared their breakfast plates.\nJames looked highly insulted by this babying, but Remus\u2019s eyes pricked with tears and he had to excuse himself.\nThey had a week to prepare for the camping trip, and on the very first day set off into the village to purchase a tent. Remus had never been camping in his life, but still found himself better equipped than James, Sirius or Peter, who were in turns distracted, terrified and fascinated by every single item in the shop. It fell to Remus to talk to the shopkeeper about boring things like ground sheets and pegs and rigging. In the end, he settled for two sensible brown and orange two-man tents, ignoring Sirius\u2019s pleading that he consider a blue and green psychedelic number.\nThe next day, Remus had to check they all had appropriate muggle clothes, seeing as they would be using a muggle campsite, then they got a crash course in cooking from Gully the house elf.\n\u201cCan\u2019t the\ngirls\ndo the cooking?\u201d James whinged, as the foul smell of burnt eggs filled the air. Mrs Potter, who had been watching with amusement came up and slapped him lightly around the head,\n\u201cSome man I\u2019ve raised here,\u201d she sniffed, \u201cIf you can\u2019t cook a young lady breakfast, don\u2019t expect her to spend the night.\u201d\n\u201cUrgh, Mum!\u201d James scowled, repulsed, while Sirius and Remus were bent over laughing.\nThey filled the rest of the time planning all of the things they would do with their holiday freedom, watching the matinee at the local cinema (there was a Bond film playing, and\nAirport \u201877\n, which was Remus\u2019s personal favourite) and of course, flying their brooms. Sirius was very impressed by Remus\u2019s recent improvement, and they actually managed to organise a very small scale quidditch game (without the snitch, Peter as Keeper).\nThere was no sign of Moody, this summer. Mr Potter explained over dinner one night that security measures on their house had been increased, and Moody was back in the Auror\u2019s office, managing things there. Remus was relieved - he\u2019d tied Moody and Ferox together in his mind, muddled them all up with the Livia encounter and Dumbledore\u2019s cruel single mindedness. All in all, after the year he\u2019d had, Remus was looking forward to a few weeks away from anyone older than him.\nIt was decided that they would all apparate to Cornwall, except for Peter, who had failed his test. Mrs Potter had kindly offered to take him as a side-along, before disapparating back home, but Peter insisted on taking the Knight bus. This way, he decided, he could collect Dorcas along the way.\nThe evening before they were set to leave, James, Sirius and Remus squeezed themselves into the red phone box at the end of the Potter\u2019s street to coordinate with what Sirius was calling \u2018the female contingent\u2019.\n\u201cCan I press the buttons, Moony?\u201d James asked, running his fingers over the silvery keypad.\n\u201cWhich bit do you talk into?\u201d Sirius said, holding the receiver up to his eyes for inspection.\n\u201cOh, for goodness sake, you two, calm down\u2026\u201d Remus dialled Lily\u2019s home number, snatching the black plastic receiver back. It rang for a bit, and he hoped that Lily would pick up the phone, and not one of her parents.\n\u201cGood evening, Evans household?\u201d A young woman answered.\n\u201cLily?\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s speaking, please?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 Remus Lupin.\u201d\nThere was a very rude snorting laugh, then the person on the other end shouted away from the receiver;\n\u201cLILY! It\u2019s for\nYOU\n!\u201d\nRemus waited, shifting from foot to foot, Sirius and James watching him eagerly.\n\u201cThanks, Pet,\u201d Lily\u2019s voice said on the other end.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be too long, I\u2019m waiting for Vernon to call.\u201d\n\u201cHello?\u201d Lily\u2019s voice came louder, directly into the phone.\n\u201cHi Lily, it\u2019s Remus.\u201d\n\u201cHiya Remus! Sorry, that was my sister. Are you all ready?\u201d\n\u201cYep, I think so. Pete\u2019s left already I think. You lot?\u201d\n\u201cMary and Marlene got here just before tea. We agreed one o\u2019clock in the afternoon, didn\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, one o\u2019clock, just outside the campsite. I made James get a map.\u201d\n\u201cOh good. I think mum\u2019s letting me borrow the A to Z.\u201d\n\u201cCool.\u201d\nJames was tugging on Remus\u2019s sleeve. He sighed, \u201cEr, Lily? James and Sirius have never used a phone before, can you talk to them for a minute so they leave me alone?\u201d\nLily laughed,\n\u201cGo on then, it\u2019ll wind Pet up.\u201d\nRemus leaned back against the glass panes and watched James and Sirius fight over the phone, taking turns to shout something at Lily and then press the receiver to their ears and listen with wonder. Night began to fall around them, and if anyone had walked past they would just have seen three village boys mucking about in a phone box, without a care in the world.\n* * *\nSaturday 9th July 1977\nRemus\u2019s first time apparating outside of Hogwarts could have gone a\nbit\nbetter, but at least he didn\u2019t end up in a tree, like James did. He ended up, in fact, about half a mile south of the campsite, on the beach.\nHe\u2019d been to the seaside before, on summer trips at St Edmund\u2019s \u2013 three times to Margate, once to Southend. He couldn\u2019t say he\u2019d particularly enjoyed these outings \u2013 or at least he didn\u2019t enjoy them any more than he would have enjoyed sitting in the back garden at St Edmund\u2019s. They were busy, noisy places, full of crying children and barking dogs and strange sugary smells and brightly coloured fairground rides.\nThis beach was almost deserted, except for a few kids \u2013 dots in the distance, really \u2013 flying a pink and blue kite. The day was warm enough, the sky was blue and the sand soft and yellow. He knew he ought to start walking towards the campsite, to find the others, but instead he sat down for a few minutes, just to look. The sea wasn\u2019t green, or bright blue, like in picture books \u2013 it was more of a concrete kind of grey. Still pretty, glimmering under the midday sun. In the very far distance, Remus could just about make out a long dark shape on the horizon. Was that France? Might be. He could pretend it was.\nRemus hadn\u2019t been able to relax, at the Potters. He\u2019d felt like a visitor there; someone who didn\u2019t belong. He didn\u2019t know where he\ndid\nbelong. Now that he was seventeen, he could go anywhere he wanted. Would it be nice to live here, in Cornwall? He had recently discovered he\u2019d been born in Bristol, and wondered what it was like there; that was by the sea, too. Remus had never thought he\u2019d live anywhere other than London. Once, he\u2019d thought he would probably never leave Essex.\nEventually, he felt too guilty and had to go and look for the others. The walk was bracing, and after a year of being confined to Hogwarts, it was a thrill just to be able to go somewhere alone. The campsite itself was halfway up the beach, on a long stretch of flat, neatly trimmed grass. A few families had already pitched tents, and the mothers and fathers were sitting outside them in deck chairs, soaking up the rare English summer sun with cups of tea and newspapers standing by.\nMary, Marlene, James and Sirius were sitting on a picnic bench outside the site office, which was little more than a breezeblock hut. Mary and Marlene jumped up when they saw him,\n\u201cWe thought we\u2019d lost you!\u201d\n\u201cOvershot,\u201d he explained, \u201cLanded on the beach - not in the water, luckily.\u201d\n\u201cWe all ballsed it up, a bit,\u201d Mary laughed, and they each recounted the strange places they\u2019d ended up. Except for Lily, who had arrived in precisely the place she\u2019d meant to. She was inside the office, booking them in.\nThis done, the party set about finding the perfect place to pitch their tents. James and Sirius decided this needed to be as close to the beach as possible. Then there was the matter of actually erecting the tents, which was endlessly fascinating to the two pureblood boys.\nLily took charge, channelling her prefect persona, reading out directions and barking out orders.\n\u201cNo\nnot\nthat hook, I said the one in the corner\u2026 bloody hell, Black, use the flipping mallet, not your boot! Come on, chop chop, we haven\u2019t got all day\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBlimey, Evans,\u201d James grinned, standing with his arms up, holding one of the poles in place while Mary and Marlene tried to get the canvas over it, \u201cHave you ever considered quidditch coaching? You\u2019d be incredible.\u201d\n\u201cPlease, no,\u201d Marlene called out, muffled under the heavy fabric. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the team if I have to put up with\nboth\nof you blowing whistles at me.\u201d\nIt took almost two hours, but it was a huge amount of fun, and everyone was very pleased with themselves once all four tents were up in a neat row, facing out to sea.\n\u201cWell done, lads,\u201d Lily smiled, sitting cross legged on the grass they waited for the kettle to boil, \u201cAnd no magic at all. You\u2019ll make muggles yet.\u201d\nPeter and Dorcas arrived shortly after that, looking very rumpled and tired from their long journey on the Knight bus.\n\u201cIt stopped at Guernsey twice before we even started south\u2026\u201d Dorcas explained, looking vaguely disturbed. Peter accepted a cup of tea and sat in silence, yawning.\nOnce they\u2019d woken up a bit, Mary decided it was time to go to the beach. It was about three o\u2019clock by then, but still very warm, and they had hours of daylight left. The girls disappeared into their tents to get into swimming costumes. Sirius and James had been so excited by the prospect of muggle swimming trunks that they\u2019d been wearing them all day anyway, and Remus \u2013 still in jeans and long sleeves \u2013 wasn\u2019t planning to take off his clothes under any circumstances.\nHe did remove his trainers and socks, when they reached the sand, but ignored the other\u2019s pleas to join them in the sea. He was happy enough to sit on the bank, enjoying the warm sun on his back and listening to the seagulls screaming overhead. The girls shrieked too, as they dipped their toes in the icy cold water, and they made a game of running back and forth with the tide, daring each other to get in. James was knocked over by a wave when he wasn\u2019t looking \u2013 too busy staring at Lily\u2019s long bare legs. Mind you, Remus caught her throwing a few longing glances at him too. Those muscles were pretty hard to ignore.\nSirius, as usual was in a league of his own. He strode out into the surf as if it was as warm as bathwater, and as soon as he was waist deep, dived right under, sleek and graceful as a fish. He swam long, languid strokes, and came back looking happier than Remus had seen him in a long time.\nAfterwards, wrapped in towels, the girls showed the pureblood boys how to build a sandcastle without any magic, and James and Peter became extremely invested in creating a complicated irrigation system to ensure that the moat was properly supplied at all times.\nBack at the tents they cooked dinner \u2013 thankfully Marlene and Dorcas offered to supervise this, frying bacon over a little gas burner Lily\u2019s father had donated. James and Lily went off to the shop \u2013 ostensibly for milk \u2013 and returned with a case of cider.\n\u201cMuggle drinks, too?!\u201d Sirius exclaimed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a fully rounded experience, apparently,\u201d James laughed. Lily giggled then blushed and looked away.\nRemus could already see where the evening was heading, and sat himself as far away from Sirius as possible. They\u2019d already agreed that Sirius and James would share one tent, with Peter and Remus in the other, so at least there would be no awkwardness there. He just had to watch his drinking.\nMary had lit a fire using magic while Lily had been gone (\u201cno one tell her, all right? I\u2019m not about to sit here freezing my snatch off while Potter and Black piss about rubbing sticks together.\u201d), and Marlene had brought a wireless radio, so once the cans of cider had been passed around it was a very cosy scene indeed.\n\u201cHow long have you two been going out?\u201d Dorcas asked James and Lily. They leapt apart, looking at each other guiltily.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not!\u201d Lily squeaked, moving to sit next to Remus, as if to prove it. Mary and Marlene exchanged a look, and Sirius shot a confused glance at James.\n\u201cOh, sorry!\u201d Dorcas smiled, oblivious, \u201cI just thought\u2026 but Sirius and Mary,\nyou\nused to go out, right?\u201d\n\u201cFor my sins,\u201d Mary squawked, laughing. Sirius poked his tongue out at her.\nMarlene, who had been reading a guidebook she\u2019d bought in the visitor\u2019s information centre, cleared her throat loudly,\n\u201cThere\u2019s a castle ruin not far from here, we could go tomorrow?\u201d Which swiftly changed the subject to plans for the rest of the week. Camping holidays seemed to involve a lot of walking, Remus realised. He hoped his hip would be up to it.\nA few tins in and they were all in a very silly mood. The drink was flat and clear, which Remus knew was a dangerous sign when it came to cider. They\u2019d all have skull-splitting headaches in the morning if they weren\u2019t careful. He didn\u2019t bring it up, though - everyone was so happy, why spoil it worrying about consequences?\nDorcas was lying back on Peter\u2019s chest, using him as an armchair, humming softly to the music. He was trying to get his hand under her shirt, and thought he was being discreet. Mary and Marlene were whispering to each other, bursting into giggles every now and then. James and Sirius were throwing stones into the fire \u2013 it was obviously a competition of sorts, but Remus couldn\u2019t figure out what the rules were supposed to be.\nA familiar tune began to play on the radio \u2013 Mott the Hoople. It was a few years old now, but it had been a favourite at Gryffindor parties,\n\n\u201cBilly rapped all night about his suicide,\n\n\nHow he\u2019d kick it in the head when he was twenty-five,\n\n\nSpeed jive, don\u2019t wanna stay alive, when you\u2019re twenty five\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cTurn it up!\u201d Mary nudged Marlene, who flicked her wand at the wireless, lazily, then cracked open another can. They all hushed to listen, nodding along and tapping their feet softly on the grass. When the chorus came, the girls all sang along in that soft, under the breath way that girls were so good at,\n\n\u201cAll the young dudes, carry the news\u2026\u201d\n\nWhen the song finished they cheered drunkenly, laughing amongst themselves.\n\u201cI bloody love you lot,\u201d Marlene slurred, \u201cYou\u2019re all my best friends,\u201d\n\u201cSame to you, McKinnon,\u201d Sirius grinned across the flames, raising his can.\n\u201cShhh!\u201d She waggled a drunken finger at him, dopily, \u201cI know\nyour\ngame, Black. I\u2019ll have you know, you\u2019re not my type.\u201d\nEverybody laughed at that, even Sirius.\n\u201cWhen are we going to find\nyou\na nice girl, hm Remus?\u201d Lily said, thoughtfully, squeezing up to him for warmth and laying her head on his shoulder.\nHe smiled wanly, putting an affectionate arm around her.\n\u201cYeah, you deserve a bit of fun, Moony,\u201d James winked at him.\nRemus avoided Sirius sudden glare by taking another swig from his can.\n\u201cI have plenty of fun with you lot.\u201d He said.\n\u201cHave you\never\nhad a girlfriend, Remus?\u201d Dorcas asked. She didn\u2019t mean anything by it; she didn\u2019t know them very well. But there was an awkward hush all the same. Or maybe Remus was the only one who noticed. He glanced up at Mary coyly and smiled.\n\u201cNah,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAww,\u201d Dorcas said, very tipsy, \u201cHow come?\u201d\nSuddenly, it dawned on Remus. Marlene was right \u2013 he\nloved\nthese people, every one of them. What was the point, keeping secrets from them? This wasn\u2019t up to Sirius, this wasn\u2019t up to anyone but him. He breathed in and looked at the fire again.\n\u201cI\u2019m gay.\u201d He said.\nPeter choked on his drink. Out of the corner of his eye, Remus saw James run his hands through his hair, sit up straighter. He saw Mary\u2019s mouth fall open, and heard Marlene give out a surprised hiccup. He dared not look at Sirius. His stomach turned and he prepared to get up, to walk away and apparate somewhere. Anywhere.\nBut then Lily raised her head. She kissed his cheek and hugged him tighter, before settling back down against his shoulder.\n\u201cYou still deserve some fun.\u201d She said, decisively."

Everyone was drunk, but they were probably the drunkest.\n\u201cGo back to your tent, if you\u2019re going to do that!\u201d James threw an empty cider can at them.\n\u201cD\u2019you mind, Moony?\u201d Peter surfaced, red in the face and bleary eyed, \u201cIf we go back to ours? You can bunk in with Prongs and Padfoot, can\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Remus waved a hand, \u201cI\u2019ll find somewhere.\u201d Sirius still hadn\u2019t looked at him, and he had a feeling that after the evening\u2019s revelations he would not be particularly welcome.\nPeter and Dorcas disappeared, there was muffled giggling from within the tent, then the ghostly, hollow quiet of a silencing charm.\n\u201cShare with us if you want, Remus?\u201d Mary said, getting up to leave for her own tent. Lily nodded,\n\u201cYeah, our tent\u2019s much bigger \u2013 come in with us.\u201d\n\u201cThanks girls,\u201d He smiled \u2013 he really was grateful. \u201cYou go on \u2013 I\u2019m not tired yet. Think I\u2019ll just go for a walk.\u201d\nHe got up, limbs stiff and aching, and headed for the sea. It was properly dark now, away from the fire, but Remus had always been able to see in the dark. The tide was in, and louder than ever. A cold breeze flew forth, and he fumbled in his back pocket for a cigarette. He lit up and inhaled deeply, closing his eyes, feeling that now he could really\nthink\n.\nHe was glad he\u2019d said it, no matter what the reaction, but he still considered leaving. Ok, so they weren\u2019t all about to kick his head in, but who knew how they\u2019d all act in the cold light of morning, stark and sober. Was it better or worse than being a werewolf?\nHe could still apparate, if he wanted to; go and look for Grant, maybe. Remus felt a surge of guilt. He hadn\u2019t thought about Grant in a while \u2013 maybe not all year. The other boy had been so kind to him; taken him in and been willing to put him up indefinitely. He\u2019d given Remus some excellent advice too, if only Remus had taken it.\nStay away from posh boys.\n\u201cAlright, Moony?\u201d James approached him. Remus turned. Sirius was with him, looking sheepish. It looked as though James had dragged him over against his will. Remus wasn\u2019t surprised.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he nodded. He offered James a cigarette. James shook his head, no.\n\u201cJust\u2026 wanted to see you were ok.\u201d\n\u201cFine, thanks.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\u201cSorry if I made things awkward.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d James said, a little too eagerly, as if he\u2019d been hoping Remus would bring it up first. Sirius winced, but only Remus noticed. \u201cHonestly, mate, we\u2019re glad you told us, really.\u201d\nRemus just nodded, and looked back at the sea, taking another drag on his cigarette. Behind him, he heard James nudging Sirius, obviously trying to get him to say something reassuring and friendly, but to no avail.\nJames spoke again, \u201cDon\u2019t run off, ok, Moony?\u201d\nRemus turned back, raising an eyebrow. James was grinning, \u201cYeah, we know what you\u2019re like. Stay, ok? Everything\u2019s fine. Even Pete wasn\u2019t that bothered.\u201d\n\u201cPete,\u201d Remus snorted, \u201cHe\u2019s too busy trying to get his end away.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t blame him.\u201d James laughed. He touched Remus\u2019s shoulder, \u201cD\u2019you want to talk about it?\u201d\nRemus shook his head, looking down. He stubbed out his cigarette and immediately lit another. Sirius wanted one, he could tell. But Remus was feeling belligerent, and unless Black\nasked\n, like a normal human being, he wasn\u2019t going to get one.\n\u201cThanks, James.\u201d Remus said, pointedly, exhaling smoke, \u201cYou\u2019re a real mate.\u201d\n\u201cStill marauders.\u201d James smiled, tiredly. He yawned, \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna turn in. Coming?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have another one after this.\u201d Remus raised his second cigarette.\n\u201cI\u2019ll have one too.\u201d Sirius said, gruffly. James nodded, stifling another yawn, and turned away.\n\u201cDon\u2019t come back stinking of fag ash, you two.\u201d He threw over his shoulder, as he walked back towards the campfire on the turf.\nRemus returned his gaze to the sea, but handed Sirius the box. He heard him withdraw a cigarette, light up, inhale. He waited for it.\n\u201c...Why\u2019d you say that?\u201d Sirius said.\nRemus closed his eyes and smiled softly. He didn\u2019t want a fight, but he was ready for one - he was always ready.\n\u201cWanted to. I just had to know what they\u2019d think, one way or another.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019ve just gone and changed everything around on me.\u201d He didn\u2019t sound accusatory. He sounded hurt.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t mean to.\u201d Remus said.\n\u201cWere you expecting me to say something too?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t expecting anything.\u201d Remus snapped. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything to do with you, actually.\u201d\n\u201cOk, ok.\u201d Sirius raised his hands in surrender, still looking uncomfortable. \u201cJust\u2026 I just thought you might have told\nme\nfirst, that\u2019s all. Given the\u2026 situation.\u201d\nThis caught Remus entirely off guard, and he finally looked at Sirius,\n\u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t already know?! How could you not know?!\u201d\n\u201cYou said you weren\u2019t.\u201d Sirius shrugged. \u201cLike I said\nI\nwasn\u2019t. Thought we were both on the same page, that\u2019s all.\u201d\nRemus found his anger returning. Typical Sirius, never thinking about anything more than his own personal gratification, never once considering that anyone else had feelings or thoughts.\n\u201cObviously we weren\u2019t.\u201d He said, coldly. \u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t see how it matters now. If\nthat\u2019s\nall you\u2019re worried about, then don\u2019t. You\u2019re safe.\u201d Remus said, stonily. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell anyone about you and me, and I doubt anyone suspects you, what with your\nconsiderable\nhistory with girls. I don\u2019t see why you care so much what\nI\ntell people.\u201d\n\u201cI do\ncare.\n\u201d Sirius protested.\nRemus closed his eyes. A few months ago, that would have sounded wonderful. But\ngod\n, he was so tired.\n\u201cRemus?!\u201d Sirius sounded half annoyed, half frightened, \u201cI\ncan\ncare about you and not\u2026 y\u2019know, not scream it from the rooftops.\u201d\n\u201cWanting to get off with me isn\u2019t the same as caring.\u201d\n\u201cRemus! Fucking hell, just because I\u2019m not\u2026 I haven\u2019t got wherever you have, yet. It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have the same\u2026 ugh, fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d Sirius cursed at his own inarticulacy.\n\u201cAnd all the girls?\u201d Remus tutted.\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s different.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d Remus sighed, his voice empty. He was willing to leave it there. Sirius wasn\u2019t.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t say anything He didn\u2019t see that he\nhad\nto understand. He just had to be the stronger one here.\nSirius continued, a hand on Remus\u2019s arm. \u201cWhen I think about myself with them, I can just\u2026 see it, y\u2019know? I know how it\u2019s going to play out. I know what I\u2019m s\u2019posed to do. When I think about me and you\u2026 you know, the\nreal\nme and you. It\u2019s just\u2026 I can\u2019t see how it ends. I just tried not to think about it. So, I\nknow\nI was a bit of a dick, I could have handled it better, but I swear, I didn\u2019t want it to end like that.\u201d His breathing was shallow now, Remus could hear his heartrate increasing by the second, \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to end at all, to be honest.\u201d\nRemus nodded. He pushed Sirius\u2019s hand away, gently, looking out at the sea. He knew Sirius was staring at him, but he kept facing forward.\n\u201cLook, Sirius, I don\u2019t mean to be cruel, I\ndo\nunderstand all that.\u201d He really did - hadn\u2019t he been over it all, in his own head? \u201cI know it\u2019s not easy for you.\u201d\nSirius made a noise of relief at that, seemed to relax slightly. Maybe they were getting somewhere for once.\nRemus pushed on, \u201cBut\u2026 it\nis\neasy for me. I\u2019m queer, ok? I know when we started I said I wasn\u2019t and\u2026 well I shouldn\u2019t have said that, because I am. And I\u2019m not saying\nyou\u2019re\nqueer too, or you have to be, or anything, but I couldn\u2019t carry on the way we were without you\u2026 just, I dunno,\nacknowledging\nit.\u201d\nSirius was watching him very closely as he said this, thinking hard. Remus knew how he looked when he was thinking; when he was working a problem through. It wasn\u2019t mischievous, or cheeky, or sarcastic, it was deeply solemn and serious. It was really bloody sexy, actually, but Remus tried to ignore that bit.\nFinally, done thinking, Sirius gave a short nod.\n\u201cOk then.\u201d He said, simply.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Remus frowned.\n\u201cFucking acknowledged. Message received.\u201d Sirius stubbed out his cigarette in the wet sand.\n\u201cSo\u2026 what?\u201d Remus gaped, \u201cWe just leave things as they are?\u201d\nSirius scratched behind his ear, looking down, a strange, shy gesture.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d rather not.\u201d Remus repeated, dumbfounded.\n\u201cNo. I mean, if you want me to go \u2018round telling everyone I know then sorry, but we\u2019re not all as ballsy as you. I need more time. But\u2026 I could\ntry\n.\u201d\n\u201cYou could try.\u201d This was not the outcome Remus had expected when the conversation began. \u201cWhat do you m--\u201d\nSirius cut him off, placing a palm on Remus\u2019s cheek to turn it towards him, and kissing him gently on the lips.\n\u201cI mean I will try.\u201d He said, as he pulled away. \u201cI\nmiss\nyou, Moony.\u201d\nOh, you would go and say something like that\u2026\nRemus grabbed him and pulled him back. It was like water after a drought, shelter in a storm - they were the still point of the turning world and every other stupid sloppy clich\u00e9 you could think of. They kissed for a long time, and when they came apart they were practically gasping with relief.\n\u201cNo more girls?\u201d Remus asked, still holding Sirius in place, as if he might run away.\n\u201cNo more girls.\u201d Sirius agreed. \u201cLet\u2019s see how this pans out first.\u201d\n\u201cOh, charming.\u201d Remus let go, satisfied.\n\u201cShuddup,\u201d Sirius nudged him with his shoulder, hands deep inside his pockets. \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go back to the tent eh? Freezing.\u201d\nThey walked towards the tents and the dying fire with their backs to the wind.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m drunk,\u201d Remus said, shakily. He felt all stirred up. \u201cI make bad decisions when I\u2019m drunk.\u201d\nSirius laughed and squeezed his shoulder quickly,\n\u201cI know. I promise this isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d\nI\u2019m trusting you...\nUnfortunately, they found that none of the tents were available any more. The tent Remus had been sharing with Pete was well and truly occupied, by the sounds of it. Sirius grimaced, and cast a fresh silencing spell over the flagging one.\n\u201cAmateurs.\u201d He muttered.\nThere was a silencing spell cast over James and Sirius\u2019s tent too. Mary poked her head out of the next one along, giggling,\n\u201cIt\u2019s James and Lily!\u201d\n\u201cAre you serious?!\u201d Sirius gaped. \u201cBloody hell. I mean\u2026 wow, I sort of want to go in and shake his hand.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve a feeling his hands are busy,\u201d Remus raised an eyebrow.\n\u201cWant to get in with me, Remus?\u201d Mary asked, tipsily.\n\u201cWhat about Sirius?\u201d\n\u201cOh, right\u2026 ugh fine, I\u2019ll get in with Marls. Night, lads.\u201d She crawled across the grass into Marlene\u2019s tent.\nSirius and Remus looked at each other for a few moments, before Sirius climbed in first. The girls\u2019 tent was much more comfortable than theirs, stuffed with blankets and pillows and a plump blow up mattress.\n\u201cKnew we should have got the muggleborns to sort us out.\u201d Sirius grumbled, as he settled in. The mattress was old and sank slightly in the middle, rolling them together in an almost comical way. In the end, the only way to get comfortable was to curl up like spoons.\n\u201cThis ok?\u201d Remus asked, as he slipped an arm around Sirius\u2019s waist.\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Sirius replied.\n\u201cWe could just sleep\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\nSonoro Quiescis\n.\u201d\n\u201cAh, ok\u2026\u201d\nWell. It had been a while.\nAfterwards, Remus felt more awake than he ever had in his life. His brain was buzzing with questions, declarations, thoughts,\nwords\n. It felt like coming out of hiding, like pulling back a disguise he had worn too long. He wanted to bear every bit of himself to Sirius; he wanted Sirius to\nsee\nhim,\n\u201cSirius?\u201d\n\u201cMmhh?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s something else I need to tell you.\u201d\n\u201cOh merlin,\u201d Sirius groaned, rolling onto his back, sleepily, \u201cWhat now?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m um\u2026 well, I\u2019m homeless.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Sirius opened his eyes and turned around at once, \u201cWhat??\u201d\n\u201cSince I turned seventeen. Y\u2019know, I\u2019m of age now, so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSo they just chucked you out?\u201d\nRemus nodded, glad to share the problem.\n\u201cYeah, so once Hogwarts finishes next summer I\u2019ve got nowhere to go\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBastards.\u201d Sirius said angrily. He looked at Remus very seriously, \u201cYou can stay with me and James, at the Potters. They won\u2019t mind, I know they won\u2019t. Then when school\u2019s finished we\u2019ll find our own place.\u201d\n\u201cWe will?!\u201d Remus raised his eyebrows.\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Sirius replied, happily, folding his arms behind his head, \u201cIt\u2019ll be just like school - you, me, James and Pete, all together.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Remus realised what he\u2019d meant. \u201cYeah, sounds great. I\u2019ve a bit of money Lyall left me.\u201d\n\u201cPfft.\u201d Sirius replied, \u201cI\u2019ve got enough money for\nall\nof us, don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d\n\u201cOk,\u201d Remus said. \u201cI won\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\u201cGo to sleep,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cOr you\u2019ll be knackered tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cOk,\u201d Remus repeated, closing his eyes."

            "content": "Remus woke up and stretched beneath bright canvas, Sirius breathing lightly beside him. It was a little bit too warm and sticky, but he wouldn\u2019t have moved for anything. Lying peacefully under the blankets, he could still taste the salt on Sirius\u2019s skin, feel his heartbeat. At the bottom of the sleeping bag, their feet were tangled together.\nSirius stirred, screwing up his face before he opened his eyes.\n\u201cMorning.\u201d\n\u201cMorning.\u201d\n\u201cFuck me, my mouth is dry.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, mine too,\u201d Remus agreed, running his tongue over his teeth. All that cider. \u201cI could go and get some water from the pump?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll both go. Reckon anyone else is up?\u201d\nRemus listened carefully, then shook his head. He hoped Sirius wasn\u2019t worried about getting caught - surely no one could question their sharing a tent? What else could they have done? It was probably a\nbit\nearly to start interrogating Sirius, so Remus held his tongue as they dressed quietly and quickly, fishing about in the bottom of the bed for their clothes, which seemed to have scattered in the night.\nClambering out and blinking hard against the bright daylight, Remus thought that everything seemed to look different. The same; but not quite as he\u2019d remembered it before. More realistic; solid and anchored down.\nThey sauntered off in the direction of the water pump with their canteens, and as they walked, they fell into step, and Remus felt as though his heart would burst with joy. Stupid, really, such a small thing. The campsite was lovely and peaceful, sparrows darting between the trees overhead, and the occasional camper popping their head out and wishing a polite \u2018good morning\u2019 to the boys as they passed.\nThe water pump was by the shower block, and they both ducked in to wash their faces quickly, before filling their canteens, as well as the others they\u2019d brought.\n\u201cShop sells pasties,\u201d Sirius said, thoughtfully, nodding in the direction of a little wooden hut with a blue and white striped awning, \u201cShall we get some for breakfast, return to the camp as heroes?\u201d\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d Remus smiled, shyly.\nThey bought far too many Cornish pasties, but they were fresh out of the oven, flaky and buttery and warm, and Sirius had no impulse control.\nBack at the tents, no one had stirred yet, apparently, so Remus and Sirius decided they would take their breakfast on the beach. They sat on a sand dune, side by side, munching peacefully and licking the grease from their fingers afterwards.\n\u201cI could get used to this,\u201d Sirius said with a grin, rubbing his hands on his jeans, sighing happily at the view. The sand had been washed clean overnight by the tide. Everything was perfect and unblemished. \u201cNever been on a proper holiday before.\u201d\n\u201cMe neither.\u201d\nRemus wiped his own hands on his corduroy trousers and picked restlessly at the grass.\n\u201cOi,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up Moony? We said no worrying.\u201d\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\u201cI was just wondering something. It\u2019s stupid, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nThey were quiet again. Remus fidgeted some more. He sighed. \u201cWhy me?\u201d He asked, quietly.\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026why me, in the first place? Why not James, or\u2026 literally\nanyone\nelse? Is it just because\u2026 is it because I let you? Path of least resistance?\u201d\n\u201cObviously not.\u201d Sirius scoffed, frowning. \u201cWhat do you mean why not James? I don\u2019t\nfancy\nJames.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026 oh.\u201d\n\u201cI think we can at least admit we fancy each other.\u201d Sirius raised an eyebrow, thumbing Remus\u2019s hip through the thin fabric of his t-shirt. Remus nodded,\n\u201cYeah. I just thought. I dunno.\u201d\n\u201cWe never touched, much.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cBefore all the shagging.\u201d Sirius said, matter-of-factly. \u201cI used to wrestle with James all the time, and we used to share a bed sometimes and everything. Not you. You kept yourself separate. No touching.\u201d\n\u201cI was\u2026 shy.\u201d\n\u201cIt got me curious, I s\u2019pose. One Christmas, remember when Andromeda came to the Potters? I was really nervy, convinced my mother was coming to get me every five minutes, I jumped whenever the door went.\u201d\n\u201cI remember.\u201d Remus said, softly. \u201cThird year.\u201d\n\u201cWell, the door went, and I was bricking it, we were on the landing, I think. You sort of squeezed my shoulder and\u2026 well it just felt really nice. It meant more, because it was you. I felt like you\u2019d\u2026 I dunno, chosen me, or something. Couldn\u2019t get you out of my head for weeks.\u201d\n\u201cWe were fourteen!\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cYou and Mary started going out not long after that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, look how that turned out.\u201d Sirius huffed a laugh. Remus laughed too, despite himself. \u201cThen on your birthday,\u201d Sirius said, his voice faltering a bit, as if it was a difficult thing for him to talk about. \u201cYou\u2026 you kissed me.\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d Remus replied, steadily. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cI didn't expect it, it was so out of the blue. I\u2019d been thinking about you, before that, but I didn\u2019t really know\u2026 I didn\u2019t know that I was thinking about\nthat\n. Then I thought\u2026 maybe it was my fault, like I\u2019d given off some message, like I\u2019d tricked you into it or something.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! No! Trust me, I very much wanted to kiss you.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Good. Because I just felt so awful about it, y\u2019know - it was your first kiss, and I went and mucked it all up.\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Remus sighed, \u201cLook, while we\u2019re being honest, you might as well know - it wasn\u2019t my first kiss.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026 the summer before, I sort of met someone. I never told any of you. I didn\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t want you to know I was queer.\u201d\n\u201cThat boy.\u201d Sirius said, suddenly, \u201cAt the muggle squat, in Mile End.\u201d\n\u201cHis name\u2019s Grant.\u201d Remus explained.\n\u201cWell, I hate him.\u201d\nRemus laughed.\n\u201cThat\u2019s ok, he\u2019s so nice he won\u2019t even mind.\u201d\n\u201cI hate him even more.\u201d\n\u201cI ought to try and see him this summer. He\u2019s been so good to me, you don\u2019t even know the half of it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll go with you, if you want.\u201d\n\u201c...thanks, that's kind.\u201d\n\u201cMoony,\u201d Sirius said, quietly.\n\u201cMm?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry about everything.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d\n\u201cIt is.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s n\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSirius! For god\u2019s sake, you can\u2019t even apologise without starting a fight. I\u2019m telling you \u2013 it\u2019s ok. I was being unfair. I think\u2026 I think I was asking you for something I don\u2019t even understand properly myself. Loyalty or love or whatever.\u201d\n\u201cI do\nlove\nyou, Moony. I love all of you; you, James, Peter.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus sighed. He closed his eyes, as if to re-set the conversation. When he opened them again, Sirius looked anxious. Remus smiled, reassuringly, \u201cLooking forward to seventh year?\u201d\n\u201cDunno. Bit scary, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the war?\u201d\n\u201cThe war.\u201d Sirius agreed, \u201cOther stuff too. Last year before we have to grow up.\u201d\nRemus laughed, softly,\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever grow up, Padfoot.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been so selfish.\u201d Sirius had turned melancholy again.\n\u201cI said it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not, though,\u201d his brow creased slightly, as he searched for the words he needed. Remus held his breath, not sure what was coming, but somehow knowing he needed to hear it. \u201cYou have so many secrets, and it must be so shit, keeping things back,\u201d Sirius began, gaining momentum the more he spoke, \u201cAnd I made it all worse, I just gave you more things to hide\u2026\u201d\nI\u2019ve loved keeping your secret\n, Remus wanted to say,\nI\u2019d keep a thousand more, for you.\nHe knew that this line of thinking could only make things worse, so he said nothing. Sirius risked reaching out, grasping Remus\u2019s hand and holding it. Remus squeezed back.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m ashamed of you, or this, it\u2019s\u2026 a million other things. I wish I could tell\neveryone\n, I wish I was ready. I will be, Moony, I promise.\u201d\nSirius looked at him, full of pleading. Remus forgave him wholeheartedly. It wasn\u2019t difficult to meet his eyes any more.\n\u201cJames seemed\u2026 pretty ok with me being queer.\u201d Remus prompted, quietly. He felt a bit underhanded, bringing up James - James belonged to Sirius, it wasn\u2019t Remus\u2019s business to interfere.\n\u201cOf course he was, the beautiful bastard,\u201d Sirius snorted, \u201cFucking prince among men, isn\u2019t he? I know. I know he\u2019d probably be fine with this, even,\u201d he gripped Remus\u2019s fingers, \u201cBut\u2026 He\u2019s my\nbest\nfriend, and I just don\u2019t want that to change yet. I wouldn\u2019t want to be alone with him and have him wondering\u2026 Even if\nhe\nwasn\u2019t thinking about it, I would be.\u201d\n\u201cOk,\u201d Remus said. He was agreeing to everything, he knew it was stupid. But it was so easy now.\n\u201cMorning, lads!\u201d Mary yelled from the campsite, Sirius pulled his hand back, quickly, giving Remus an apologetic glance, \u201cCheers for the pasties!\u201d\nThey both turned around and waved at her. Sirius got up, extending an arm to help Remus to his feet.\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he said, eyes twinkling, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to rip the shit out of Prongs for finally getting his leg over.\u201d\n\u201cNot in front of Lily!\u201d Remus cautioned, \u201cShe\u2019ll curse your knob of.\u201d\n\u201cWell, can\u2019t have that, I\u2019m very attached to my knob.\u201d\n\u201cSirius?\u201d\n\u201cRemus?\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just for the summer, is it?\u201d\nSirius looked at him and grinned.\n\u201cI bloody hope not.\u201d\nFortunately, no one was much interested in whatever Sirius and Remus had been up to the night before, because everybody else's night had been just as eventful. Peter gave him a bit of a wary look, but that might have been the hangover. Mary was grinning at everyone like the cat who\u2019d got the cream, picking at her pasty and trying to catch Lily\u2019s eye.\nMarlene was bundled up in blankets, looking very green around the gills and giving out the occasional moan.\n\u201cAlright, Marls?\u201d Remus asked, gently.\n\u201cMmmmph.\u201d\n\u201cPoor love,\u201d Mary tutted, patting her friend\u2019s blonde head gently, \u201cWent a bit hard on the Old Rosie, didn\u2019t you? Still, could be worse. Dorcas hasn\u2019t come back from the loo\u2019s, yet.\u201d\nJames and Lily were sitting next to each other, but not too close. Lily had scraped her hair back in a pigtail, and was consciously staring at the ground, eating her pasty with a kind of quiet resignation. James looked absolutely chuffed, but was trying not to show it too much.\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Mary grinned, widely, looking around at everyone, \u201cWe\u2019ll stick with the new sleeping arrangements for the rest of the week, then, shall we?\u201d\n\u201cSuits me.\u201d Sirius said, casually.\n\u201cAnd me,\u201d Peter nodded, mouth full of mince.\nMarlene gave a silent, queasy thumbs up. James and Lily looked at each other, then looked away.\nOnce everyone had finished eating, the girls arranged an expedition to the shower block. The boys followed after, towels under their arms and Sirius teased James mercilessly.\n\u201cNo, go away, I\u2019m not telling you anything.\u201d James laughed.\n\u201cThis is purely for academic purposes,\u201d Sirius chided, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a matter of historical interest, future generations will need to know what miraculous feats you had to perform in order to finally convince Evans to--\u201d\n\u201cWe just\ntalked\n!\u201d\n\u201cOh, so the silencing spell was for\u2026?\u201d\nJames turned bright red and disappeared inside a shower cubicle. Sirius chucked triumphantly.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t anyone want to know about me and Dorcas?\u201d Peter asked, innocently.\n* * *\nThe castle ruins were about five miles walk, which nobody seemed to think was too far at all. Marlene had perked up a bit after showering and eating, and everyone decided that fresh air was probably the best cure for a hangover. They zipped up their tents, stuffing valuables into rucksacks - along with some leftover pasties and bottles of water - and set off around eleven.\nThey followed a footpath along the shoreline, which curled around and gradually steepened into a cliff. The view at the top was breath-taking, but Remus was struggling to enjoy it much - his eyes watered and his legs burned with the effort of clambering uphill. Sirius, Marlene and Mary had raced to the top; Marlene coming first despite her queasiness. James surprised Remus by slowing down to match his own shambling crawl.\n\u201cAlright there, Moony?\u201d He asked, cheerfully,\n\u201cBrilliant,\u201d Remus panted, not sure if he was pulling off sarcasm or just sounded like a terrible liar.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in no rush, take it easy.\u201d\n\u201cHmmph.\u201d\n\u201cPadfoot wasn\u2019t too much of a tosser last night, was he? About the whole\u2026 er\u2026 about the stuff you told us?\u201d\nRemus shook his head, focussing on breathing, and the horrible\ngrind-click\nnoise that hard started happening in his hip every time he stepped forward.\n\u201cGood,\u201d James nodded, relieved, \u201cI just worried he might be, y\u2019know what his family was like about that kind of thing. Was in two minds about leaving him alone with you to be honest, but I thought you\u2019d just give him a thump if he got out of order.\u201d\n\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d Remus wheezed, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d James said again, and stopped, because Remus had. Just for a moment.\nThe other six had crested the hill now, and were disappearing down the other side. They\u2019d only been walking for twenty minutes, Remus thought grimly. He wondered if he could apparate ahead - but the \u2018deliberation\u2019 part would be difficult, without a map, or having seen the place before. He was embarrassed, having James stay back with him, but at least it wasn\u2019t one of the girls.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, wiping sweat from his brow, \u201cUsually not as bad this far away from the moon.\u201d\n\u201cS\u2019fine,\u201d James shrugged, \u201cWe\u2019re on holiday, not a route march.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to catch up with Lily? I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cGiving her a bit of space. I think she\u2019s embarrassed.\u201d\n\u201cShe really likes you, though,\u201d Remus said, encouragingly, \u201cShe told me.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d James smiled, getting that dopey, dreamy look as he stared over the clifftop, \u201cCan\u2019t believe my bloody luck.\u201d He cleared his throat, \u201cBut it was\njust\ntalking, all right? that\u2019s the party line, don\u2019t say anything to Black.\u201d\nRemus laughed, straightening up,\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d They began to walk again, steadily. The sun was reaching its highest point, blazing above them so that they had to squint, or look at their feet.\n\u201cWe talked about you, actually,\u201d James said. \u201cWell, Lily did. I listened.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cYeah - nothing horrible, I promise! I think it was probably just the cider and we were both rambling about how you were such a good mate, and then she said something about being brave and making your feelings known and living honestly, or\u2026 oh, I dunno, I was too busy being amazed she was even talking to me.\u201d\nRemus smiled at James, and wanted to hug him on Lily\u2019s behalf.\nThey reached the castle two hours later, a good half an hour behind the rest of the group, who had waited for them.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Sirius said, once they were out of earshot of the others, \u201cI didn\u2019t think.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Remus smiled, trying to hide his exhaustion, \u201cI had Prongs.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a local bus that goes back past the campsite, I checked,\u201d Sirius said, gallantly, \u201cWe can get that back, if you want?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m\nfine\n.\u201d\nThe castle was a ruin, beautiful grey stone in the summer sunshine, cast against the glistening sea, hundreds of feet below. Remus could barely believe anyone had really lived there - the narrow spiral staircases had crumbled and led nowhere, long grass and bright yellow dandelions had invaded what might once have been a great feasting hall. There were arrow slits in the remaining walls, and graffiti carved into the parapets, where no doubt some bored soldier had waited once, a thousand years ago. Perhaps he hadn\u2019t been much older than they were. War never changed.\nJames, Peter and Sirius began a very enthusiastic sword fight with some stray sticks they\u2019d found, while Remus sat rolling up cigarettes on a pile of rocks, watching them.\n\u201cYou\u2019d feel a lot fitter if you didn\u2019t fill your lungs up with that shit,\u201d Marlene tutted.\n\u201cHere for a good time, not a long time, Marls,\u201d he replied, dryly, licking the adhesive strip on his paper and sticking it down carefully.\nHe made four or five, just to pass the time, tucking them neatly into an old matchbox he\u2019d saved for the purpose. He watched Sirius, playing the knight against Peter\u2019s dragon, and laughed as James captured Lily - apparently now a princess - hoisting her effortlessly over his shoulder and running for the castle gates. She laughed and beat her fits against his back playfully, and when he put her down she looked so happy in his arms.\nEventually, some of the other tourists started to get a bit annoyed with the eight teenagers mucking about, so they decided it was time to go back down to the beach and spend the rest of the afternoon cooling off in the sea.\nLily and James led the group this time, hand in hand, chattering happily as if they had been this intimate for years. A pang of envy shot through Remus. Not that he wanted to hold Sirius\u2019s hand. For one thing, it was much too hot, for another, you couldn\u2019t keep Sirius still long enough.\n\u201cYou lot go ahead,\u201d Sirius called, \u201cMe and Moony are having a fag break.\u201d\nMarlene tutted once more, but hurried to catch up with the others.\nRemus and Sirius sat on a stone wall for a bit, smoking.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pub down there,\u201d Sirius nodded further up the lane. \u201cSaw it on the way up, it\u2019s got a garden. Want to go and waste some time?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus said, surprised. That sounded ideal. \u201cBut don\u2019t you want to catch up with James?\u201d\n\u201cJames doesn\u2019t love me anymore,\u201d Sirius sighed, dramatically, holding his wrist against his forehead like an old woman about to faint, \u201cHis heart has been claimed by another.\u201d\nRemus laughed, then dared to say,\n\u201cOh well. you\u2019ve got me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d Sirius nodded with a grin, hopping down from the wall. \u201cC\u2019mon, then. Could murder a pint.\u201d\nThe pub was a small whitewashed cottage with mustard yellow shutters, a red tile roof and a neat row of red geraniums planted in pots outside. Inside was dark, musty and cavernous; Remus had to duck under the low ceiling. The gruff working men propping up the bar all turned to look as they entered, and for a moment Remus wondered if it had been a bad idea after all.\nStill, Sirius ordered two pints of lager, and they took them outside to the garden, sitting on a table underneath a beech tree for shade. As they headed out, the surly barman and unfriendly locals turned back to their own drinks, obviously deciding to ignore the two boys. Remus was sure he heard one of them mutter \u2018bloody toffs,\u2019 which he took as a personal slight, though of course it could have been much worse. Still, they were alone in the garden, and had the privacy they\u2019d been seeking.\nSirius was impervious to the attitudes of others - maybe he didn\u2019t notice; maybe he just didn\u2019t think muggles were worth worrying about.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great here,\u201d he said, gulping down his foggy, warm beer, \u201cD\u2019you think we could live here, when it\u2019s all over?\u201d\n\u201cI like London,\u201d Remus replied, \u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m used to.\u201d\n\u201cRemember you promised we could go to Carnaby Street,\u201d Sirius said, playing with Remus\u2019s matchbox, \u201cThis summer. I\u2019m holding you to it.\u201d\n\u201cWhen did I say that?\u201d\n\u201cChristmas.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right. Ok, we\u2019ll go.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you forgot.\u201d\n\u201cWell you also spent half of Christmas trying to convince me to get a girlfriend, so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cUggh,\u201d Sirius groaned, apparently in shame, \u201cSorry. I thought it might help me er\u2026 feel less attached to you. Sounds a bit bonkers now I think about it...\u201d\n\u201c\nNow\nit sounds bonkers,\u201d Remus kicked him gently under the table.\n\u201cLogical thought processes are not my forte, Mr Moony,\u201d Sirius laughed, with an aristocratic turn of his head, \u201cYou ought to make your peace with it if we\u2019re going to\u2026 um\u2026 if we\u2019re going to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cStart going out\u2026\u201d Remus prompted, gently. Sirius gave him an apologetic smile,\n\u201cGoing out, yeah.\u201d He agreed. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get there,\u201d Remus said, casually, gulping his pint.\nAnd with that, the ice was broken, and they began to talk. And talk, and talk. It was that easy; after months of failure to communicate, it seemed that the gates had now been flung open wide. They found that once they had begun, they couldn\u2019t stop. Remus would relate some assumption he had made; some belief he had held about an interaction long ago, and what he thought it had meant at the time. And Sirius would shake his head with wide, earnest eyes and say;\n\u201cBut Moony, it wasn\u2019t like that\nat all\n.\u201d\nWhen it came down to brass tacks, Remus discovered that much of his misery was his own making; that most of the time Sirius had never meant harm, and often hadn\u2019t even known he was causing Remus any pain at all - it was just his own bungled idea of what was going on. They even talked about Mary.\n\u201cI really did like her,\u201d he said, \u201cI think that\u2019s what threw me off, in the beginning. Y\u2019know, it wasn\u2019t like girls weren\u2019t\ndoing it\nfor me, in that department\u2026 and she was so confident.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you were just with her because you didn\u2019t want to be with me.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sirius said, firmly, \u201cThat\u2019s a horrible thought. It was for her, not for you.\u201d He looked at him, \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cHa, don\u2019t be. That makes me feel better, actually.\u201d\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Sirius smirked, \u201cWhat about\nyou\nand Mary?\u201d\n\u201cOh god,\u201d Remus buried his face in his hands, \u201cDon\u2019t. I\u2019m so embarrassed.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I liked it.\u201d Sirius raised an eyebrow, giving Remus a look so sultry it would probably get him arrested in some parts of the country.\n\u201cI noticed.\u201d He blushed, \u201cDidn\u2019t help you feel less attached, then?\u201d\n\u201cApparently not.\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t mind that. And yet, when you found out about Chris\u2026\u201d\nSirius straightened up, looking annoyed,\n\u201cHim.\u201d He grumbled.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing between us. We\u2019re just friends.\u201d\n\u201cAnd\u2026 this other bloke\u2026 Grant? Was he...\u201d Sirius shifted, obviously uncomfortable as he struggled to get the word out, \u201cYour boyfriend?\u201d\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Remus replied, easily, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain. He\u2019s\u2026 a friend. I care about him as much as I do you, and James, and Peter, and the girls.\u201d\n\u201cMore secrets, Remus.\u201d Sirius ran his hands through his hair, frustrated, \u201cI can\u2019t keep track, I dunno how you do it. Can you stop hiding stuff? From me, at least?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Remus said, quietly, \u201cIt\u2019ll be hard.\u201d\n\u201cBut you can try.\u201d Sirius smiled. Remus chuckled, and nodded.\nThey finished their drinks, and decided to head back to the campsite.\n\u201cI\u2019ll teach you to swim.\u201d Sirius offered.\n\u201cFuck off, will you.\u201d Remus snorted.\n\u201cIs there anything else you\u2019ve been keeping secret, eh, Remu?\u201d Sirius nudged him, as they meandered slowly downhill. It was much easier, the way back, but they were going very slowly anyway.\n\u201cNope,\u201d Remus laughed. He felt light as air - it was like being high; having nothing to hide at all, \u201cQueer, illiterate, homeless, werewolf\u2026\u201d he ticked them off on his fingers, \u201cI think that\u2019s it. Oh, and my mother.\u201d\n\u201cYour mother?!\u201d\n\u201cI got a letter, in that box of depressing stuff from Dumbledore. Photos, and a letter - an apology.\u201d\n\u201cOh, blimey, ok. What did it--\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to talk about it yet. Sorry.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Sirius shrugged, \u201cLet\u2019s say we can talk about anything at all, except our mothers.\u201d\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d Remus nodded."

            "content": "The rest of the week in Cornwall passed in complete bliss, as far as Remus and Sirius were concerned. They spent long hot days on the beach and hillsides, wandering through quaint little villages, exploring caves and getting tipsy in pub gardens. They dined exclusively on pasties, fish and chips and ice cream, and at night - oh, the nights were best of all.\n\n\nDuring the day, if the others were around, they would toss a ball back and forth across the sand, or Remus would consent to paddle in the sea a little - jeans rolled up and long sleeved shirt still firmly on. If it was just the two of them, then he might roll the sleeves up to his elbows, exposing old scars, and Sirius would become Padfoot and chase sticks or his own tail. And they often got to be alone, because everyone else seemed to want to keep sneaking off.\n\n\nLily and James were the worst - when they weren\u2019t bickering they were snogging; gratuitously, and at length.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be prefects!\u201d Mary yelled at them, after the third night, finding them practically horizontal in front of the campfire.\n\n\n\u201cOh, as if I haven\u2019t caught you a hundred times on my rounds!\u201d Lily laughed, getting up and straightening her clothes nonetheless. \u201c\n\n\nAnd you\n\n\n, Black, so you can stop leering.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sirius blinked, innocently.\n\n\nHe was carrying back the bowl of washing up from the shower block. Remus had been pretty amazed by that - Sirius had volunteered to do the dishes every night so far (\u201cI quite like doing it, the muggle way,\u201d he had confided, secretively, \u201cMother used to make us do the house elf\u2019s work as a punishment sometimes, but I just found it relaxing, to be honest.\u201d)\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t draw\n\n\nme\n\n\ninto your sordid escapades,\u201d Sirius was saying, prudishly, setting down the tub. \u201cI\u2019ve been a perfect gentleman all holiday.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not convinced you haven\u2019t been sneaking off with some muggle girl in the village.\u201d Marlene said. She was lying stretched out on a towel in her underwear, sunbathing. Her body was very long and very pale.\n\n\n\u201cHow dare you,\u201d Sirius flicked her with the damp tea towel, making her yelp and crease up, \u201cI\u2019ve been tucked up in bed early every night, haven\u2019t I, Moony?\u201d\n\n\nRemus choked on the crackers he\u2019d been nibbling on, and had to be slapped on the back by James a few times before he recovered.\n\n\nYou\u2019ll pay for that later, Black,\n\n\nhe glared at Sirius, eyes watering.\n\n\nOnce James had calmed down about the \u2018Lily Evans Event\u2019 (as Sirius was calling it, behind his back) enough to think straight, he\u2019d been surprised that Sirius and Remus were now sharing a tent, and suspicious, for all the wrong reasons.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to start fighting again, you two? You know you only wind each other up in close proximity...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight you are, Prong,\u201d Sirius said, brightly, \u201cYou bunk in with Moony and I\u2019ll share with Evans.\u201d\n\n\nThat put an end to\n\n\nthat\n\n\nline of questioning, but not to James\u2019s sudden overprotectiveness of Remus. It was nice - certainly nothing to whinge about - but a bit uncomfortable. Remus had never had any kind of big brother figure - unless you counted Ste or Craig, who had taught him to steal and drink and throw a proper punch - but James now seemed determined to do his clumsy, kind-hearted best. Midway through the week, Remus was a little surprised that no one had so much as mentioned the confession he had made on the first night. Not that he wanted anyone to make a fuss, or say anything sly or backhanded, but\u2026\n\n\nstill\n\n\n. Nothing at all? He brought it up with Sirius in a quiet moment, and he\u2019d laughed,\n\n\n\u201cWell if Prongs gave everyone else that bloody speech I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSpeech?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah he pulled me aside and told me if I started treating you any differently he\u2019d thump me. Probably didn\u2019t say that to the girls - maybe Lily did them.\u201d Sirius stretched out, doggishly, lying on his front.\n\n\nThey were lounging on the beach, alone, on a quiet stretch of sand which so far no one else had discovered. Sirius was in his swimming trunks and Remus was taking the opportunity to stare at him as much as he liked, and as brazenly as he liked. Every now and then he gathered a handful of silky yellow sand and poured it over Sirius\u2019s skin, just to watch the grains slide like water over the muscles of his back.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re having me on.\u201d Remus said, lazily, not believing Sirius.\n\n\n\u201cWish I was. I swear, it was so hard not to laugh in his face and just tell him everything.\u201d He rolled over, brushing the sand away carelessly, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to go and wash off in a minute, if you keep doing that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the idea,\u201d Remus smirked. Sirius in the sea was his new favourite thing to look at.\n\n\nRemus still didn\u2019t\n\n\nreally\n\n\nbelieve him, until the very last day of the holiday. They were all trying to pack up the tents - which didn\u2019t seem to want to fit back into the bags they\u2019d arrived in - and Remus had ended up taking over, because Peter, Sirius and James didn\u2019t seem to understand the concept of instructions. The girls had deconstructed their own camp in less than an hour, and it was getting a bit shameful.\n\n\n\u201cRight, that peg needs to come out first, and there\u2019s a sort of top sheet we need to remove, otherwise everything gets tangled up\u2026\u201d Remus said, scratching his head. James and Sirius did this successfully and began folding up the brown canvas.\n\n\n\u201cWhat would we do without you, Moony,\u201d James chuckled.\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter said from the ground, where he was collecting pegs, \u201cWho\u2019d have thought you\u2019d be good at all this stuff.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, I have always been the sensible one,\u201d Remus murmured, not really paying it any mind, skimming the next few steps in the leaflet. Then he realised it had gone quiet, and James was standing over Peter.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018this stuff\u2019?\u201d\n\n\nPeter looked up, confused, and rubbed his hands together,\n\n\n\u201cY\u2019know, outdoorsy stuff - blokey stuff. I didn\u2019t mean--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPete. A word.\u201d James said, his voice weirdly hard and flat; channeling Euphemia Potter in a stern mood. He marched off, towards the beach, Peter following nervously behind, still wringing his hands.\n\n\n\u201cBlokey stuff.\u201d Sirius muttered, though he looked anxious and pale too.\n\n\n\u201cWhat was that all about?!\u201d Remus asked, going over to pick up the pegs Peter had put down.\n\n\nSirius shook his head, and didn\u2019t speak again until Peter and James returned, Peter looking very shaken. Remus wished he could have said something, but he felt like he might only make the problem worse.\n\n\nWhen it came time to say goodbye, nobody wanted to leave. Remus found himself staring glumly down at the four yellow squares of grass where their tents had been, while James and Lily clung to each other, saying their goodbyes.\n\n\n\u201cYou going back to Essex, Remus?\u201d Mary asked, cheerfully.\n\n\n\u201cStaying with the Potters for a bit.\u201d Remus replied, trying to perk up.\n\n\n\u201cLucky!\u201d Mary said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to go back to Croydon - Marlene invited me to stay, but Mum says she doesn\u2019t see enough of me as it is.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d Remus smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be missed.\u201d\n\n\nPeter and Dorcas left first, heading up to the main road to find a secluded spot to hail the Knight Bus. Remus waved them off, and everything\n\n\nseemed\n\n\nfine, but that might just have been James\u2019s presence. The girls apparated - once Lily finally let go of James, promising to visit before the summer was over, promising to write, making James promise to telephone. She hugged Remus, and then - perhaps just in a moment of blind happiness, Sirius too.\n\n\nJames, Remus and Sirius apparated back to the Potter\u2019s with somewhat more success than the first time. Remus ended up in the back garden, somehow, Sirius somewhere in the village, but Mrs Potter was thrilled to see them all the same, and decided they all needed some\n\n\nproper food\n\n\n, at once.\n\n\n\u201cShould we get in touch with the home for you, Remus?\u201d Mr Potter asked, casually over dinner, \u201cYou\u2019re not pulling another vanishing act, are you? Can\u2019t have the muggle police called again.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh - er, no, I\u2026 um\u2026\u201d Remus stammered over his boiled potatoes - what could he say, to stop them asking? What would buy a bit more time? Sirius kicked him underneath the table, and gave him a look.\n\n\nGo on, Moony\n\n\n, it said;\n\n\ntell the truth.\n\n\nRemus looked at Mr Potter, \u201cActually, now I\u2019m seventeen, there isn\u2019t a place for me at St Edmund\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh good,\u201d Mrs Potter smiled benignly, \u201cWe\u2019ve got you all summer then, wonderful!\u201d\n\n\nAs easy as that.\n\n\n\u201cI told you,\u201d Sirius whispered, as he slid into Remus\u2019s bed, after midnight. \u201cThe Potters love taking in strays.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShould you be here?\u201d Remus whispered back, anxiously, \u201cWhat about James?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSnoring his head off, I could hear him through the wall.\u201d\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t press it further - after all, he wanted Sirius there. It felt funny, lying alone in a big double bed after a week spent squished up in a tent. Having another body close by was comforting. Having Sirius\u2019s body close by was even better.\n\n\n\u201cWell done for telling them.\u201d Sirius said, quietly, holding Remus\u2019s hand under the covers. He did that often, and only in bed, in the dark. Remus didn\u2019t mind.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m just telling everyone everything, this week,\u201d Remus laughed.\n\n\n\u201cNothing wrong with asking for help, Moony. People\n\n\nlike\n\n\nhelping their friends.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Remus kissed the top of Sirius's head \u00a0- one of the many privileges now permitted to him. Sirius liked to sleep hidden under the covers, like a hibernating creature. It made him seem smaller than he was, and made Remus feel protective. Another thing that was ok to feel, now. \u201cSirius?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat thing Wormtail said, did it really upset you?\u201d\n\n\nHe felt Sirius tense against him, and instantly wished he hadn\u2019t brought it up. He tried to cover his tracks, \u201cJust... you know Pete, he\u2019s a bit of an idiot sometimes, but he\u2019s just thick, not spiteful. He\u2019ll get used to it. Get used to me. Next time he needs his homework done, it won\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard stuff like that before, that\u2019s all.\u201d Sirius said, very low, so that Remus, who usually had perfect hearing - better than perfect - had to listen closely. \u201cAbout being a man. You know the sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFrom your mother?\u201d\n\n\nSirius didn\u2019t speak, but his head moved slightly and Remus took it for a nod.\n\n\n\nWe aren\u2019t talking about mothers.\n\n\nRemus had to remind himself. He just squeezed Sirius\u2019s hand, and said the only thing he could think of.\n\n\n\u201cWell then, you know it was all bollocks.\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nSaturday 30th July 1977\n\n\nJames Potter was not as clever as Remus had given him credit for. They had been back from Cornwall for a fortnight. James had telephoned Lily from the phonebox at the end of the road exactly fourteen times. And exactly fourteen times, Remus had had to accompany James to the phonebox, put the coins in the slot, \u00a0dial the number for him,\n\n\nand\n\n\nshow him how to hang up, at the end.\n\n\nThe phonecalls lasted about an hour, usually, leaving Sirius and Remus to sit outside on the brick wall, smoking. Occasionally they walked up and down the high street, but mostly they just waited for James to finish.\n\n\n\u201cBloody idiot.\u201d Remus sighed, as he exited the booth the fourteenth time. \u201cHow hard is it to remember a few simple steps? He did muggle studies, don\u2019t they explain this stuff?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAww, he gets too excited to remember anything.\u201d Sirius laughed, \u201cHave some sympathy for the lovesick fool.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo. I will be joyless and miserable forever.\u201d Remus grumbled, fumbling with his cigarette lighter.\n\n\n\u201cOh good, I love it when you\u2019re all dark and moody.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFuck off.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm, oooh yeah, now call me a stupid prat, that really gets me going\u2026\u201d Sirius teased, cigarette between his teeth, embers glowing in his eyes. Remus shoved him so that he stumbled off the wall, laughing.\n\n\n\u201cYou\n\n\nare\n\n\nbeing a stupid prat.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOnly for you.\u201d Sirius stubbed out his cigarette. There was a low, dark rumbling in the far distance, and Sirius\u2019s whole face lit up. He grabbed Remus\u2019s arm, \u201cLook! here it comes, right on time!\u201d\n\n\nRemus rolled his eyes. Sirius had another reason to indulge James. Every evening, while they waited for the lovebirds to finish their phone call, a miraculous thing happened - in Sirius\u2019s eyes, anyway. A motorbike drove through the village - probably some aging hippie on his way home from his boring commuter job, Remus thought, petulantly.\n\n\nIt was a Triumph Bonneville T120 (Remus hated that he knew this, but after they\u2019d seen it the first time Sirius had dragged them to the newsagent\u2019s to buy every motorcyclist magazine he could find, until they had identified the model), with a cherry red tank, every inch of chrome polished to a gleaming silver. Sirius was madly in love, Remus was madly jealous.\n\n\nOnce the bike had passed, Sirius gave a sigh of satisfaction, then climbed back onto the wall, and watched Remus for a while. He did that a lot, now. Remus had to learn not to mind too much; being scrutinised. Sirius cocked his head, \u201cIs it the moon? Making you grumpy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cProbably.\u201d Remus shrugged. \u201cUsually makes me restless.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I noticed, last night.\u201d Sirius winked.\n\n\n\u201cOh my god, shut\n\n\nup,\n\n\nobnoxious prick.\u201d\n\n\nSirius grinned and poked out his sharp pink tongue.\n\n\nRemus\n\n\nwas\n\n\nnervous about the moon. It would be his first full moon not spent at either Hogwarts or St Edmund\u2019s. (Though presumably there had been another full moon, once, long ago, with his mother.) Mr Potter had taken him aside, after it was agreed Remus would be staying for the rest of the summer, and explained their plan of action.\n\n\nNot that it mattered much to Remus; a locked room was a locked room. This time it was the attic, and Moody had offered to stand guard outside, ensuring that the family would be safe. Mr and Mrs Potter (not to mention James and Sirius) had repeatedly reassured Remus that they weren\u2019t concerned in the slightest, and that he oughtn\u2019t to worry either. But of course he did, anyway.\n\n\nSirius wanted to go in with him - so did James, but James at least had enough common sense to realise it wouldn\u2019t be possible. No one was going to get anything past Moody - who had a new, creepy eye, electric blue and horribly enchanted.\n\n\n\u201cTackled werewolves before,\u201d he said, gruffly, as Remus was led up the ladder to the attic, \u201cAlways got a good result, minimal casualties.\u201d\n\n\nThis did not make Remus feel better, but he wasn\u2019t sure if it was supposed to.\n\n\nIt was a bad night. Maybe it was Moody\u2019s presence. Maybe the wolf didn\u2019t like heights. Maybe it could smell its usual playmates, Prongs and Padfoot, and felt lonely. Maybe the wolf just hated Remus, who knew. Either way, when he woke he found he\u2019d ripped the room apart; torn at the blinds and scratched the floorboards. In the end, the wolf had chewed its own paws out of frustration.\n\n\nHands bleeding, the skin all grazed away, Remus lay in the dark, his heart pounding, waiting for the pain to subside, or for someone to come and help him; whichever came first.\n\n\nMrs Potter patched him up, and did a good job, but he still struggled to hold his wand for a few days, while the skin grew back. He couldn\u2019t hold a broomhandle, either, so had to just watch while Peter, Sirius and James practiced, like old times.\n\n\nRemus found other ways to occupy himself. He\u2019d got hold of a copy of the telephone book and spent more time than was probably healthy looking up every \u2018Jenkins\u2019 in Bristol. There were lots of them, but no Hopes.\n\n\nHopeless\n\n\n. It didn\u2019t matter, he tried to tell himself. He\u2019d got on all right for twelve years without her.\n\n\n\u201cTell me a secret,\u201d Sirius would whisper, late at night - every night, he came to Remus, \u201cTell me something no one knows.\u201d\n\n\nAnd Remus would tell him - because it made Sirius happy, and that was a very worthwhile pursuit - in fact, Remus was realising, making Sirius happy might be the only thing worth doing, for the rest of his life.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the one who told Philomena Pettigrew to go to America.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou never!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYep, in the bathroom on Christmas eve.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSly bastard. How\u2019d you get girls falling all over each other to talk to you, eh? what\u2019s your secret?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe they trust me because they know I\u2019m not trying to get off with them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAn intriguing thought. Tell me another secret.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve told you everything.\u201d\n\n\nEverything that wouldn\u2019t hurt you,\n\n\nhe added, silently.\n\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t,\u201d Sirius said, his lips now against Remus\u2019s, as he crawled on top of him, hands sliding up under Remus\u2019s night shirt. He flicked his tongue along Remus\u2019s bottom lip, \u201cI\u2019m going to know everything about you, one day, I promise.\u201d\n\n\nRemus kissed him deeply, believing every word."

Moody had bound him to the bed (kept in the attic specifically for this purpose) using some kind of advanced magic. It didn\u2019t hurt, but it was pretty humiliating, having to lie there and wait to be released, without any clothes on. Sirius had been vehemently against the idea, but it didn\u2019t hurt, and it was better than the alternative. Remus didn\u2019t care how the wolf felt about it.\n\u201cMade a lot of noise,\u201d Moody said, as he released him, \u201cBut that\u2019s to be expected.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do the others do?\u201d Remus asked, pulling on his jeans quickly, wishing Moody would leave, or at least turn his back, \u201cThe werewolves the ministry knows about?\u201d\n\u201cEither deal with it at home like this - with an Auror checking in before and after - or report to the ministry holding cells. I\u2019ll get you a leaflet, if you want.\u201d\n\u201cNo thanks.\u201d\nRemus had the distinct impression that Moody did not approve of Remus\u2019s decision not to register himself.\nDownstairs, in his normal bedroom, Mrs Potter had laid out a set of robes on the bed for him - not uniform robes, but normal, everyday ones. The sort that James and Sirius wore out of school. He hoped they were hand-me-downs; he didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d ever repay them if they started buying him clothes.\n\u201cThey\u2019re for going out in,\u201d James explained, when Remus asked about it, \u201cDiagon Alley today!\u201d\nWith the first day of school not far off, it had been agreed that the boys would stay in Diagon Alley for the last few days of the summer holiday. Mr and Mrs Potter would be leaving for a few weeks - on business for Dumbledore, apparently, though they neither confirmed nor denied this. Even Moody could not argue with Remus going to Diagon Alley this time,\n\u201cCrawling with Aurors, these days - under cover, you wouldn\u2019t even know it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m seventeen,\u201d Remus said, curtly, \u201cSo I\u2019m free to go where I please.\u201d\n\u201cQuite,\u201d Euphemia said, tiredly.\nTheir Hogwarts letters had arrived only a week ago, and to everyone\u2019s surprise James had been named Head Boy, as evidenced by a brand new gold pin tucked inside his envelope.\n\u201cBloody hell!\u201d James gasped,\n\u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d Sirius frowned.\n\u201cLanguage!\u201d Mrs Potter scolded them both.\nShe\u2019d been very proud, of course, but James was only interested in telling Lily, and rushed to owl her at once - in less than half an hour, they learned that she had been made Head Girl.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fate!\u201d James declared, \u201cDestiny!\u201d\nThey used Floo powder to get to The Leaky Cauldron, a homely, old fashioned wizard pub which doubled-up as a B&B, meeting place and general community centre, as far as Remus could tell. James had booked two twin rooms, and after being greeted by the odd looking, hunchbacked publican, the four marauders hauled their school trunks up the stairs to settle in. Remus was sharing with Peter, because neither Remus nor Sirius could come up with an excuse for sharing together. The rooms were adjoining, which was some small comfort, but not much.\nDiagon Alley was not like Hogsmeade, as Remus had thought it might be; it was more packed in, bustling, noisy - the wizarding equivalent of cosmopolitan. The streets were busy with throngs of students, and every shop was packed to the rafters.\nGringotts was the first port of call for everyone, and Remus followed James and Sirius around the palatial bank, struck dumb by the complete alienness of everything. Remus had never even been in a muggle bank before, but nothing could have prepared him for Gringotts; goblins and secret passageways and mountains and mountains of gold. James and Sirius swanned about like VIP members - mind you, they probably were. The goblins grovelled at their feet, which Remus found hugely distasteful, but couldn\u2019t really say anything about. He wished Lily was there, or Marlene and Mary - anyone a bit more down to earth.\nRemus found he had been left just under four hundred galleons in the vault which had once belonged to Lyall Lupin. This sounded like an enormous amount to Remus - until he saw the pitying look on Sirius\u2019s face. He quietly took out enough for his books and some new robes, as well as a bit of spending cash to convert to muggle money.\nRemus was so shattered after the full moon and the floo powder and the bank, that once he\u2019d withdrawn his money he had to go back to the room at the Leaky Cauldron to collapse. The others promised him they\u2019d leave off shopping until the next day, and would spend the rest of their afternoon looking at brooms and quidditch supplies. Remus was too tired to care, and crashed out on his little single bed, dead to the world for at least fifteen hours. He didn\u2019t even wake when the others came clattering in at midnight, smelling strongly of whisky, loudly shushing each other and giggling.\nThe next day, Lily arrived, and their school shopping began in earnest. She and Remus had similarly methodical minds when it came to completing tasks, and conferred privately on a plan of action, before ordering the other three boys about for the rest of the morning. Remus wished he could have more time in Flourish and Blotts, but as they had done books last (being the heaviest items on the list), James, Sirius and Peter were seriously flagging by this point, and on the verge of mutiny if they didn\u2019t get some ice cream.\nSo; back to The Leaky Cauldron to dump their goods and have some lunch, (\u201cFor god\u2019s sake, James, you can\u2019t have ice cream before you\u2019ve had any real food, that\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d), then to Florean Fortescue\u2019s, where Sirius tried to buy Remus a scoop of every single flavour (\u201cC\u2019mon, Moony, it\u2019s only fair, you\u2019ve never tried them before; how will you know which is your favourite?!\u201d)\nOnce all of this had been completed, Remus found his energy almost completely depleted once again, and it was only two in the afternoon. He considered taking a quick nap, but it was their last night in London, and he had one thing he really needed to do before leaving.\nIt took a little while to get a quiet moment to himself, but in the gent\u2019s at Florean Fortescue\u2019s, Remus took the opportunity to pull out his pocket watch. He clicked it upen - the mechanism every bit as satisfying as it had been the first time he\u2019d used it - and whispered, \u201cGrant Chapman,\u201d at the compass half.\nHe expected the arrow to start pointing east, but much to his alarm, it began to spin uncontrollably around and around, faster and faster. The compass had not come with instructions, but Remus had a sinking feeling that something he\u2019d known all along was finally being confirmed. Grant was not safe. Grant needed help.\n* * *\n\nI live off you!\n\n\nAnd you live off me!\n\n\nAnd the whole world lives off of everybody\n\n\nSee we gotta be exploited!\n\n\nSee we gotta be exploited!\n\n\nBy somebody by somebody by somebody\u2026\n\n\nRemus hurried back to the little table outside the parlour, where his four friends were sitting, making a lot of raucous noise over something Peter had just done with his milkshake.\n\u201cAlright, Moony,\u201d Sirius grinned as Remus hovered nearby, \u201cThis lot want to go and do some sightseeing stuff, but it sounds boring, want to bunk off down Carnaby street, finally?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, great!\u201d Remus said, forcing a grin. He widened his eyes at Sirius, hoping he got the message. Thankfully, Sirius was very skilled at following secret signals, and came over at once,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He whispered, \u201cYou look a right state.\u201d\n\u201cI have to go and find Grant.\u201d Remus said, agitated. \u201cLook!\u201d He showed Sirius the compass\u2019 mad spinning.\n\u201cRight now?\u201d Sirius frowned, \u201cBut we were going to--\u201d\n\u201cNow.\u201d Remus said. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it, I just have to, I\nknow\nI have to. Could you tell James and Peter something? I don\u2019t know what - just if they ask.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No, I\u2019m coming with you!\u201d\n\u201cSirius\u2026\u201d\n\u201cRemus.\u201d Sirius mocked his stern tone and quirked an eyebrow.\nRemus sighed. This was probably one of those things he was supposed to include Sirius in. He swallowed his temper and relented.\n\u201cOk, fine.\u201d\n\u201cShall we just\ntell\nthe others where we\u2019re going?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Don\u2019t argue with me on this.\u201d He didn\u2019t want anyone else knowing about Grant.\nSirius, apparently recognising that Remus would only go so far, nodded, and didn\u2019t push his luck. They told the others they were going to Carnaby Street, to look at the shops, paid and hurried away, without looking back.\nThey had to go and change into muggle clothes first, and once they had left Diagon Alley they headed for Charing Cross station and caught two tubes to the squat in Mile End, which Remus thought was probably the best starting point. By the time they got there it was almost four in the afternoon.\nRemus wasn\u2019t sure if it was a year of neglect or just hindsight that made the rundown block of tenements look much less welcoming than they had last summer. The smell of damp was stronger, part of the linoleum seemed to have been ripped up, exposing dirty, cracked cream tile. It was a warm day, but it still felt cold inside. Adz, the man Remus had met the year before, was the only one of the original crowd still living there.\n\u201cGrant?\u201d He scratched his head, looking dazed, \u201cYeah, I fink \u2018e went out west, when it got too rough round \u2018ere. \u2018ammersmiff, maybe. Knocking this place down next week, I\u2019m goin\u2019 Brixton.\u201d\n\u201cHammersmith?!\u201d Remus said, \u201cThat\u2019s the other side of town!\u201d\n\u201cYeah \u2018e made some friends out there I reckon. Grant\u2019s always good at making\nfriends\n, when it suits him.\u201d\nHe said that a bit sharply, Remus didn\u2019t like it, and automatically made himself taller, squaring his shoulders. Adz looked him up and down irritably and snapped, \u201cLook, if \u2018e don\u2019t wanna be found, \u2018e won\u2019t be.\u201d\nSo, back on the Central line, and across the city they went. As they passed Tottenham Court Road, Remus felt guilty for ruining Sirius\u2019s day in muggle London, and secretly promised to make it up to him when he next had the chance. Still, Sirius was having a surprisingly good time; as enthralled by the escalators and ticket barriers as Remus had been by Gringotts.\nThey changed at Notting Hill, then walked, because Remus didn\u2019t have a clue where he was going, except for his nose, and the compass, which was spinning less erratically now, and seemed to be trying to lead in in a vague direction.\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Sirius said, staring up at the houses as they walked, peering into shop windows and stopping to watch double decker buses shunt past. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in London most of my life, and I\u2019ve never seen it like\nthis\n.\u201d\n\u201cGlad you\u2019re having fun,\u201d Remus said, distracted. They were in Shepherd\u2019s Bush now, he was pretty sure. It was past six in the evening, and he was slowing down. His hip hurt from rattling about on the underground; his shins were sore from the walking, and his back hurt because of Moody\u2019s awful binding spell.\n\u201cLet\u2019s sit down a minute, shall we?\u201d Sirius asked, with a look of deep concern. \u201cLook, there\u2019s a park over there.\u201d\nIt was Shepherd\u2019s Bush green - at least Remus knew where they were. He consented to rest only for a short while - he was mostly worried that once he\u2019d sat down it would be impossible to get up again.\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll carry you.\u201d Sirius said.\n\u201cPiss off, will you.\u201d Remus snorted, resting his elbows on his knees and leaning forward. He pulled out the compass to check it once more. \u201cUgh, it\u2019s going mental again!\u201d He groaned, \u201cI thought I was getting somewhere\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt might be because you\u2019re agitated\u201d Sirius suggested, delicately. \u201cEr\u2026 you know, because it feeds off your emotion towards the person you\u2019re looking for. So maybe if you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAre you telling me to calm down?\u201d Remus frowned.\n\u201cIt might help.\u201d Sirius replied, evenly. \u201cHow about you tell me something about Grant? Something nice?\u201d\n\u201cIf you think it will help\u2026\u201d They didn\u2019t have\ntime\nfor this, Grant needed him\nright now\n\u2026 But at this point, Remus was willing to try anything. Even if it was just a ploy from Sirius to get more information. \u201cEr\u2026 his name\u2019s Grant Chapman. I met him at St. Edmund\u2019s in 1975. He liked the same music as me, he\u2019s friendly, er\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen him.\u201d\n\u201cNot properly, I was a dog. Anyway, the point is to get you to think about him.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m doing nothing but think about him.\u201d Remus snapped. He closed his eyes and breathed in. \u201cFair hair. Curls. Er\u2026 I think blue eyes? Yeah, blue. He has a crooked front tooth. Last time I saw him he was thinner\u2026\u201d A swell of anxiety rose in his throat. \u201cEr... \u201c he stammered.\n\u201cGo on,\u201d Sirius encouraged, \u201cYou like the same music? So Bowie? T.Rex.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and he likes, um\u2026 Deep Purple.\u201d\n\u201cCool, ok, so that\u2019s how you became friends?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus nodded, feeling a bit better, focussing on the positive, \u201cHe was the only one at St Eddy\u2019s that wasn\u2019t a complete maniac, or a criminal - I mean, he had a few charges, but not like\u2026 not serious. Then one day he er\u2026 well he just kissed me, and that\u2019s how I knew\u2026\u201d Remus glanced at Sirius quickly to check that it was ok to keep going. Sirius\u2019s smile had tightened a bit, but he nodded again. \u201cHe\u2019s been a good friend, apart from that,\u201d Remus explained, \u201cHe never makes me feel bad about myself. He never makes me feel odd, or different.\u201d\n\u201cHe sounds like a really great mate.\u201d Sirius said, politely.\n\u201cYeah. And he\u2019d do anything for me. That\u2019s why I need to\u2026\u201d He looked down at the compass, and saw that now it was pointing west - a little shaky, but clear enough for Remus.\nThey got up and followed. It was past seven now, they hadn\u2019t eaten since lunch and the sun was beginning to set. Lily, James and Peter would no doubt be wondering where they were. Sirius didn\u2019t complain, just kept quiet and followed while Remus mumbled to himself, following the little golden arrow in his palm and sniffing the thick London air.\nShepherd\u2019s Bush wasn\u2019t much nicer than Mile End, and seemed to have a buzzing nightlife. Pubs and clubs were filling up around them with teens and young people from every subculture; disco kids in bright satin and sequins, grimy skinheads in suspenders and boots, old school rockers with shaggy hair and punks with studded jackets and faces full of metal. Finally, as they were coming up on Latimer Road, Remus stopped still.\n\u201cThere.\u201d He said, pointing across the darkening street to a building with blacked out windows, and steps leading down into a basement. Loud music was pounding up onto the street - whoever the band was, they had little regard for their instruments, and even less for the audience\u2019s eardrums. \u201cHe\u2019s in there.\u201d Remus said, firmly. The compass confirmed this, pointing straight ahead.\nThe basement - looked a bit livelier than Remus was comfortable with. As well as the \u2018music\u2019, loud shouts and screams were blaring from inside, east end accents, teenage rage. Skinny, yellow-toothed punks stood outside in packs, green spikey hair and heavy bike chains. Remus felt horribly vulnerable in his worn out brown corduroys and oversized grandad shirt, but Sirius was even\nmore\nout of place, with his long hippie hair and unmistakably well-bred posture.\n\u201cShould we go in?\u201d Sirius asked, without a trace of nerves.\n\u201cUm.\u201d Remus said. He was about to suggest that he go alone, when fate intervened.\n\u201cSling yer \u2018ook ya fucking nancy boy,\u201d the bouncer was yelling at a young man, who was staggering out onto the street, head bent, hands in pockets. He had a mess of dirty blond hair, and a scent that Remus would know anywhere on earth.\n\u201cGrant!\u201d Remus bolted towards him, running across the road without even looking.\nGrant didn\u2019t hear, and was making his way slowly down the street, hunched over. There was something wrong with the way he was walking; his gait twisted and skewed. He reeked of cheap gin, even standing meters away. The punks were leering at him, yelling vile obscenities to chase him off. Grant turned and sneered back, throwing up two fingers and warbling incoherently.\n\u201cGrant!\u201d Remus said again, catching him up, beneath a yellow street light. Grant finally stopped and turned, squinting. The wall behind him had been spray painted with various disparate slogans:\n\u2018EAT THE RICH\u2019,\n\u2018BUZZ KIDS AND THE GIRL NEXT DOOR/DON\u2019T WANNA PLAY IN YOUR COLD WAR\u2019,\n\u2018FUCK NATIONAL SERVICE\u2019.\n\u201cJesus Christ. What are you doin\u2019 here?\u201d Grant lurched and wobbled, drunk, leaned against a wall and clutched side, as if something was hurting him there.\n\u201cLooking for you!\u201d Remus walked up to him, trying to see his face, obscured by shadow.\n\u201cRight, obviously\u2026 bloody hell, how do you manage it every time?!\u201d Grant shook his head.\nHe didn\u2019t look good. He looked dreadful. He was thin; thinner than he should be, thinner than was really healthy. His hair was lank and looked like it hadn\u2019t been washed in a while, and he had a patchwork of bruises down one side of his face, disappearing under his t-shirt, purple and ugly.\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d\n\u201cFucking punk happened, didn\u2019t it?\u201d Grant laughed, a horrid choking sound, then staggered again and sat on the pavement. \u201cSorry mate, bit dizzy.\u201d He retched a few times, but nothing came up, so he spat.\nRemus squatted beside him, hands trembling.\n\u201cWho did this? Did it happen in there?!\u201d He leaned over, trying to get a proper look at Grant\u2019s poor battered face.\nIt was\ndefinitely\nGrant, but he was changed almost beyond recognition. Gone was the bright blue denim and cheeky grin Remus remembered. Replaced by torn black drainpipes, haunted sallow eyes, nasty looking piercings in his nose, eyebrow, lip that were definitely infected.\n\u201cGerroff,\u201d Grant swung out, wildly, drunkenly. He wouldn\u2019t have\nhit\nRemus, and it wouldn\u2019t have hurt if he had, but Sirius leapt forward in an instant,\n\u201cOi, back off, mate,\u201d\nGrant blinked and looked up at Sirius, raising a hand up to shield his eyes from the brightness of the street lamps. He frowned, then sneered,\n\u201cAnd \u2018oo the fuck are you!? Piss off will ya, I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to my mate.\u201d He turned to Remus, \u201cFancy a pint?\u201d And tried to haul himself back to his feet. Remus helped him, gripping him firmly under the elbow.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you need any more to drink\u2026 how about some dinner?\u201d\nA flash of sobriety returned to Grant\u2019s features,\n\u201cGot cash?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Remus nodded, trying to guide him away from the horrible street they were on, \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll buy you dinner, what would you like?\u201d\n\u201cOh, y\u2019know me, I\u2019m\neasy\n,\u201d Grant cackled, leaning heavily against him, but at least allowing himself to be led.\nSirius followed, looking very uncomfortable. Grant didn\u2019t even notice until they\u2019d reached a cafe, some way up the road. Sobering up a bit more by then, he was still leaning on Remus, and Remus could hear a strange hitch in his breath that told him Grant was in pain.\n\u201cIn here?\u201d Remus turned to Sirius, questioning. Sirius glanced at the illuminated window, the cheap plastic chairs inside, with a faint look of disdain, but shrugged,\n\u201cProbably the best we\u2019ll find around here.\u201d\n\u201cYou again!\u201d Grant grumbled, \u201cThought I told ya to naff off.\u201d\n\u201cGrant,\u201d Remus said, gently, \u201cThis is Sirius, my friend from school.\u201d\nGrant did a double take, narrowing his eyes (or eye, anyway, only one of them opened properly),\n\u201cWell fuck me.\u201d He murmured, still swaying, \u201cProper stunner.\u201d\nSirius looked embarrassed, so Remus herded Grant into the cafe to sit down, ordering three cups of tea and a pie and chips. Chicken and mushroom.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want no trouble from you.\u201d The burly man behind the counter said, as he set the mugs of greyish tea down. \u201cI know your types.\u201d\n\u201cPiss off ya dirty old man,\u201d Grant slurred, \u201cBet you\u2019d pay for it if you could.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did I say?!\u201d\n\u201cLook,\u201d Remus stood up, quickly, \u201cHe\u2019s sobering up, I\u2019ll keep him quiet, I swear. I\u2019ll paid up front, he\u2019ll be ok once he\u2019s eating\u2026\u201d\nThe large man looked at him appraisingly, his eyes flicking to Sirius, still seated, then Grant, then back to Remus,\n\u201cWhat are you, Christian Outreach?\u201d\n\u201cSort of.\u201d Remus nodded, trying to look religious. Whatever religious looked like. Anyway, it satisfied the cafe owner, who lumbered back behind his counter, presumably to heat up their food.\n\u201cCor,\u201d Grant laughed into his tea, \u201cYou get posher by the bloody year, Remus me old mucker.\u201d\n\u201cJust please stop trying to fight everyone for five minutes, will you?\u201d\nGrant blew a raspberry, then giggled.\nWhen the food arrived, Grant tucked into it as if he hadn\u2019t eaten in weeks. Remus hoped that wasn\u2019t true, but judging by the state of his boney frame, things didn\u2019t look good. The pie and chips were demolished in minutes, and Remus ordered a bakewell tart for afters, as well as some more tea.\n\u201cWhere are you living?\u201d He asked, hoping he sounded kind, and not accusatory. \u201cWhat were you doing in that club?\u201d\n\u201cGetting bladdered.\u201d Grant murmured. He was calmer now he\u2019d eaten, slower, and more pliant.\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve achieved that. The bruises\u2026\u201d\nGrant looked up, suddenly, right at Remus. He was stone cold sober, his eyes sharp and wide, as if Remus\u2019s face was a mirror and he was seeing himself for the first time. He touched his grubby fingers to the marred side of his cheek.\n\u201cGot into an altercation few days ago.\u201d He said, \u201cBut fuck it, I\u2019m off tomorrow, going down Brighton. Sick of bloody London. Sick of bloody miserable fucking London. Everyone wants to get at ya, do you over, any way they can. D\u2019you know what I mean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus breathed. He felt so helpless. He wanted to look to Sirius for reassurance, but it seemed somehow disrespectful to Grant.\n\u201c\u2018ow\u2019s school, poshnob?\u201d Grant asked, slurping his tea like a builder.\n\u201cOh.. ok, you know. Fine. What\u2019s in Brighton? Somewhere to live? A job? How are you getting there?\u201d\n\u201cGot friends,\u201d Grant shrugged, then winced. He\u2019d broken a rib, Remus realised, and scolded himself for not having noticed earlier.\n\u201cDo you need to go to a hospital? How long have you been like this?\u201d\n\u201cNo hospitals,\u201d Grant grumbled, curling up in his seat protectively, \u201cThey fink I\u2019m a skag head. Probably look like one, do I?\u201d\n\u201cI went to Mile End, I saw Adz.\u201d\n\u201cThat cunt. He can fuck right off \u2018n all. Look, lend me a tenner will ya? I\u2019m good for it, gimme your address an\u2019 I\u2019ll pay ya back.\u201d\n\u201cNot if you\u2019re just going to get drunk on it.\u201d\n\u201cOi, Mr high an\u2019 mighty! I\u2019ll \u2018ave you know I\ndeserve\na good drink. I\u2019ve \u2018ad me heart broken. You remember what that\u2019s like.\u201d\nHe gave Sirius a less than subtle glare. Sirius, to his credit, did not react, but stared at the sugar bowl. Someone had put their cigarette out in it.\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Grant.\u201d Remus said, sincerely, \u201cLook\u2026 where are you sleeping at the moment?\u201d\n\u201cUp the road,\u201d\n\u201cIs it safe there?\u201d\n\u201cLost my key.\u201d\nWell\n, Remus thought to himself. At least there's a\nlock\n. He\u2019d been halfway to deciding to smuggle Grant back to Diagon Alley and just facing the consequences when they got caught.\nThey ordered more tea and Grant ate some more. Once he\u2019d finished, he had grown agreeably soft and sleepy; drunk on a full stomach. Sirius and Remus helped him back to his room, in an old Edwardian terrace which looked as though it had been abandoned for years. Still, inside was busy and homelier than the condemned Mile End building. A young woman peered out if the next room along, mousy, freckled face at odds with her gunge green Mohawk.\n\u201cGrant?\nGawd\n, you pissed again? I told you vodka\u2019s not a fucking painkiller, go to a bloody doctor!\u201d She looked up at Remus, \u201cWho\u2019re you?\u201d\n\u201cA friend, I\u2019m just trying to make sure he's ok\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine, he gets like this.\u201d\nSirius performed a silent unlocking charm on Grant\u2019s door and Remus half carried Grant inside, settling him as carefully as he could onto the single mattress on the floor. It was a small room, with one tiny round window. Unfurnished, there was a stack of magazines in one corner with a lamp perched on top, a rucksack stuffed with clothes, a mirror which was rusting around the edges, and what looked like a small washing station - a bar of soap, a toothbrush and empty bowl.\nGrant curled up on the mattress and began to snore softly. Remus knelt beside him, frowning. The punk girl stood in the doorway, arms folded, looking Sirius up and down.\n\u201cHe said he was going to Brighton tomorrow,\u201d Remus said to her, \u201cIs that true?\u201d\n\u201cIf he got the money together for his train fare,\u201d she shrugged, \u201cSaid it got nicked, last week. He was seeing this really rough type. Treated him like shit, poor love.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll have the money.\u201d Remus said, firmly. \u201cWill you make sure he goes? It will be safe?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not his keeper,\u201d she shrugged, backing out, \u201cGot enough problems.\u201d\n\u201cCharming.\u201d Sirius said with a raised eyebrow as she vanished back into her room.\n\u201cShut the door,\u201d Remus said, pulling out his wand. he wanted to fix as much as he could while Grant was still sleeping. He ran through his list of healing spells - he\u2019d only done them on himself, so far, but nothing had gone\nvery\nbadly wrong\u2026\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?!\u201d Sirius came over, as Remus aimed his wand at Grant\u2019s chest. \u201cWhat about the Statute of Secrecy?!\u201d\n\u201cBugger that,\u201d Remus grunted, \u201cI can\u2019t just leave him like this.\u201d\nSirius stepped back and watched as Remus did his best to heal Grant\u2019s ribs, then clear up the bruises and blackened eye. Afterwards he leaned back, mind racing. He turned to Sirius, \u201cRight, I think I need to stay here tonight.\u201d He said, \u201cI could leave him some money, but\u2026 I think it\u2019s better if I make sure he gets to Brighton tomorrow, if that\u2019s still what he wants to do, when he\u2019s sober.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Sirius nodded, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to King\u2019s Cross, though\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be on time. I can just apparate from Victoria.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d Sirius nodded again. He sat down, leaning against the opposite wall. He took off his jacket and folded it underneath himself.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Remus asked, \u201cYou need to go back to Diagon Alley.\u201d\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t.\u201d Sirius shrugged. \u201cI can stay.\u201d\n\u201cBut James\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh right, yeah, hang on\u2026\u201d Sirius reached into his pocket and pulled out the compact mirror. Remus gazed at it enviously. He wished he had one. He\u2019d give it to Grant, and never lose him again. \u201cOi, Potter, you there? Prongs?\u201d Sirius was speaking into the device, \u201cHiya\u2026 look, me and Moony are going to a gig here, we\u2019ll be in late\u2026 don\u2019t tell anyone, ok? See you tomorrow\u2026 yeah\u2026 yeah\u2026 no, I promise. Ok. Cheers.\u201d He snapped it closed and looked at Remus, \u201cThere, done.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that. If you\u2019re worried about leaving me here with him, I\u2019m really just making sure he\u2019s ok.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m making sure you\u2019re ok, Remus.\u201d Sirius replied coolly. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you to spend all night alone in this place. C\u2019mon, let\u2019s get comfortable. Plenty of floor to go around\u2026\u201d\nRemus\u2019s guilt soared even higher then, as Sirius gave him a bright grin and extended an arm towards him. His last night before school, spent on the floor of some muggle halfway house, and he wasn\u2019t even complaining about it. Remus sat down too, and slouched down to settle under Sirius\u2019s arm. At least they were together now. Sirius kissed his head, and they both watched Grant, sleeping like a child.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Remus said, exhausted, \u201cHe\u2019s not\u2026 I don\u2019t want you to think he usually acts this way. He\u2019s obviously had a bad time.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d Sirius asked, very quietly, \u201cWhat happened to make him end up here, like this?\u201d\n\u201cHe got kicked out of St Edmund\u2019s, two years ago,\u201d Remus yawned, his eyes growing heavy. \u201cDidn\u2019t have anywhere else to go\u2026 can\u2019t get a job because he didn\u2019t do his exams at school. And I\u2019m guessing he hasn\u2019t got a proper address.\u201d\n\u201cRemus?\u201d\n\u201cMm?\u201d\n\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t happen to you, would it? Because you\u2019ve got us.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he murmured sleepily, only half paying attention, \u201cI\u2019ve got you, Padfoot. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d"

            "content": "For a horrible moment just as he woke up, Remus forgot where he was. He took in the stuffy air, the faint whiff of rotten newspaper, body odour and urine. He took in the hard floor, which had exacerbated his various aches and pains overnight. Then he opened his eyes and saw Grant, lying on the mattress opposite, staring back at him. He looked a bit better.\n\n\n\u201cMorning.\u201d Grant mouthed,\n\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Remus replied, moving against Sirius, who was still fast asleep, head back against the wall. He peeled himself away carefully and whispered to Grant, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he sleeps like the dead. I\u2019ll wake him up in a bit.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember much.\u201d Grant whispered, lying on his side, head resting on a pillow which looked dirty and stained. \u201cSorry if I was a knob. I think I am a bit of a knob, these days.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou were fine,\u201d Remus shook his head, \u201cJust\u2026 sad, maybe.\u201d\n\n\nGrant looked stricken, so Remus moved to get up.\n\n\n\u201cLoo?\u201d He asked.\n\n\n\u201cDownstairs. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d Grant pulled himself up, gingerly, then looked amazed, \u201cBlimey,\u201d he said, patting his side, \u201cMust\u2019ve just been a bruise, after all. Knew I didn\u2019t need no doctor.\u201d\n\n\nRemus pursed his lips and followed Grant out. Downstairs was already alive with activity, despite the early hour. The house seemed to be a kind of commune, full of all kinds of different people. There was an outhouse in the back garden (more like a yard that had been turned into an allotment) and an outdoor shower, which Remus couldn\u2019t imagine was much fun in the winter.\n\n\nStill, the people were friendly and all said hello to the two boys as they passed - which Remus remarked upon.\n\n\n\u201cEveryone seems nice?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all right,\u201d Grant replied from inside the loo, \u201cOnly been \u2018ere a few days. Leaving soon as I can.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFor Brighton? You mentioned last night\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, did I? Yeah, that\n\n\nwas\n\n\nthe plan\u2026\u201d Grant came out of the outhouse, looking sheepish, \u201cMaybe next month, though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s there? Friends?\u201d\n\n\nGrant nodded,\n\n\n\u201cYeah - one of the nicer lads from the Mile End place. Got a cousin there too - the last Chapman who don\u2019t hate me. She owns a pub, said she\u2019d hire me if I could get my shit together and pay the train fare.\u201d He sighed, heavily, washing his hands, then face in a bucket of water taken from \u00a0a big green water butt standing by the back door. \u201cS\u2019posed to \u2018prove myself\u2019.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem very\u2026\u201d What did Remus want to say? Familial? Kind? Grant had clearly experienced very little of either.\n\n\n\u201cNah, she\u2019s fair enough,\u201d Grant replied, feeling in his pockets and coming up empty. Remus handed over his own tin of roll ups, and the lighter. Grant nodded appreciatively, and continued explaining as he lit up, \u201cI\u2019ve let \u2018er down a few times before. Mostly if Grandad was involved - you know I can\u2019t stick him.\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded, trying to be understanding. Grant had a huge family - Irish Catholic, he\u2019d said once - but relations between them was often fraught, particularly where his patriarchal grandfather was concerned.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d Grant was saying, \u201cI really was going, this time, I was\u2026 but it just turned out wrong again. A lot\u2019s turned out wrong, to be honest.\u201d\n\n\nRemus wanted to hug him, but he looked so thin, so wiry and prickly, it made him afraid to.\n\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d He asked, digging into his pockets, \u201cI\u2019ve got a bit of money, left by my dad, you can have the fare, I\u2019ll take you to the station\n\n\ntoday\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Grant held up his hands.\n\n\n\u201cNot to keep, obviously,\u201d Remus said quickly, \u201cYou\u2019d owe me. Look, I\u2019ve got one more year of school, then I\u2019ll come and find you - and you\u2019ll have been working in your cousin\u2019s pub, right? So you can pay me back - how much? Tenner?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFour quid.\u201d Grant sighed. \u201cI had four quid last week too, but I\u2026 I lost it. I didn\u2019t drink it, promise.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFour quid?! I can lend you that. That\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you serious?!\u201d Grant stared at him, blinking.\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Remus nodded, frowning slightly, \u201cWhy not? You\u2019d do the same for me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Grant shook his head, then pressed the heel of his hand into one eye, as if overcome with emotion. \u201cThanks, Remus. You\u2019re such a good mate.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d do the same for me,\u201d Remus repeated.\n\n\nIt occurred to him for the first time that he and Grant were actually the same age. Grant had always been so knowing, so streetwise and protective, that Remus had considered him older; more mature. But he was only seventeen, and life had been as cruel to Grant as it had to Remus. Perhaps even more cruel, because after all, Remus knew in his heart he would never be homeless; he could never be alone while the marauders were there. He needed to learn to stop putting people on pedestals; stop expecting so much of everybody.\n\n\nHe stepped forward then, and hugged the other boy, minding not to burn himself on the cigarette.\n\n\n\u201cWhen\u2019d you get so tall, anyway?\u201d Grant laughed, muffled under Remus\u2019s arm.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Remus chuckled, pulling back, \u201cSirius teases me all the time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSirius.\u201d Grant shook his head in amazement, \u201c\n\n\nSirius\n\n\nand\n\n\nRemus\n\n\n. Bloody hell. It is him? The posh lad what broke your heart?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 yeah. It\u2019s ok now, though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI \u2018ope so, Remus mate.\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThere was time for Grant to pack his meagre possessions, and for Sirius and Remus to take him for breakfast at a small cafe in Victoria station.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to make me fat,\u201d he said to Remus, as he scoffed down his second bacon butty.\n\n\n\u201cNo chance,\u201d Remus said, prodding him in the ribs.\n\n\nSirius had been quiet all morning - but then he never did function well on a poor night\u2019s sleep. He looked only slightly rumpled, his hair a little less lustrous than usual, his eyes a bit foggy. Remus could tell that he was still fascinated by the sights and sounds of muggle London - only of course he couldn\u2019t explain that to Grant.\n\n\nGrant regarded Sirius with a similar wariness. He apologised for his behaviour the night before, and tried to explain that they\u2019d caught him on a \u2018bad night\u2019. He seemed meeker in front of Sirius, less cheeky - perhaps perceiving him as a social superior, and therefore mildly dangerous. Remus well remembered how alien Potter and Black had been to him, once upon a time.\n\n\n\u201cYou two got ya own train to catch, eh?\u201d Grant said, eyes flicking to Sirius, then Remus, then back again.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, but we\u2019ve got time.\u201d Remus said. \u201cHere, I want to give you this\u2026\u201d he handed Grant a scrap of paper which had the Potter\u2019s address on it, \u201cIt\u2019s where I\u2019m living when I\u2018m not at school. Will you send me a letter when you\u2019re settled? A postcard? Promise.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, ok,\u201d Grant nodded, tucking it away, \u201cWarning you, my handwriting\u2019s shit an\u2019 I can\u2019t spell for toffee.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about that. I just want to know where you are, next time. Do you need stamps? i should have bought stamps\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can get stamps,\u201d Grant touched his arm, \u201cYou\u2019ve done enough. Honest.\u201d\n\n\nThey hugged again on the platform. Grant shook Sirius\u2019s hand, which was weird, but polite of him.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come and visit, at Christmas maybe, or next summer,\u201d Remus said.\n\n\n\u201cI bloody well believe you, too - can\u2019t get rid of ya, can I?\u201d Grant grinned. His first genuine smile so far - it made Remus feel somewhat easier. \u00a0\u201cLike magnets, you and me, eh? Always snap right back together.\u201d\n\n\nThis hit Remus in such a way that he had to hug Grant again, until the other boy laughed and pushed him away, \u201cAll right, all right - I\u2019ve got a train to catch, y\u2019know\u2026\u201d\n\n\nAnd of course, so did Remus and Sirius. As soon as Grant had disappeared through the train doors, they bolted towards the Gentlemen\u2019s toilets to apparate to King\u2019s Cross. Inside the cubicle Sirius finally spoke. He touched Remus\u2019s arm, where Grant had only minutes before,\n\n\n\u201cYou look exhausted. Let me do it, you can side-along.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Remus could have said that he was no more tired than Sirius, who had put up with just as much as he had - but that would have been a lie. He was too tired to argue, even.\n\n\n\u201cReally.\u201d Sirius nodded, taking his arm.\n\n\n\u201cThank you for staying with me. Thank you for helping him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly.\u201d Sirius gave him a small smile. \u201cHe obviously\u2026 he loves you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe--\u201d But Remus had no chance to finish his thought; he was spinning through space, noise and colour blurring as he and Sirius left Victoria and landed - fairly gracefully - just outside King\u2019s Cross.\n\n\nThey had no choice but to run for the platform - and found James hanging out of the train door waving frantically,\n\n\n\u201cFucking hell! Where have you two\n\n\nbeen\n\n\n?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLanguage!\u201d Lily\u2019s face poked out if the next window along, \u201cYou\u2019re Head Boy now, you should be setting an example!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\n\n\nam\n\n\nsetting an example, telling these wankers off!\u201d James retorted as Sirius and Remus clambered onto the train just as the guard\u2019s whistle blew.\n\n\n\u201cLanguage!\u201d Lily said again, \u201cHonestly, James, you really need to start growing up this year, you\u2019re of age, you need to start acting\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t she brilliant?!\u201d James beamed at Remus, who was now sitting on the floor of the carriage, catching his breath. Sirius was bent over, hands on his knees, looking shockingly un-Sirius; red in the face, hair everywhere. James regarded them both, folding his arms, gold Head Boy and Quidditch Captain badges glinting on his dark robes. \u201cSo where were you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTold you. Gig.\u201d Sirius huffed.\n\n\n\u201cWhich band?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know them. Muggle band.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come back last night? Where did you\n\n\nsleep\n\n\n?!\u201d\n\n\nSirius flashed a nervous look at Remus, and Remus could see that he was on the verge of spilling everything. He stood up quickly,\n\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t sleep. It went on all night. We had breakfast then came straight here.\u201d\n\n\nSirius stared at him in amazement before nodding along. James shook his head.\n\n\n\u201cMental. And dangerous. Seriously, lads, don\u2019t do that again.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t.\u201d Sirius murmured, looking at his feet.\n\n\nLily appeared in the corridor, hands on her hips, looking beautiful and terrifying.\n\n\n\u201cPotter.\u201d She said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to lead the meeting.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight you are!\u201d James grinned, forgetting all about his two out of breath friends, following the redhead away towards the prefect\u2019s carriage. \u201cSee you later, boys!\u201d He called, absent mindedly.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a really good liar,\u201d Sirius said to Remus. Maybe it was the lack of sleep, or the pain in his hip, but this statement rubbed Remus the wrong way.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?!\u201d He snapped.\n\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Sirius looked down again. \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s find Pete.\u201d\n\n\nPeter was sitting with Mary, Marlene and Dorcas in the carriage Lily had just exited. He looked a bit outnumbered, as the girls were swapping tips for fingernail strengthening charms.\n\n\n\u201cWe thought you\u2019d miss the train!\u201d Marlene said, as Remus and Sirius entered.\n\n\n\u201cYou know me, McKinnon,\u201d Sirius gave his most charming grin, \u201cLike to make an entrance.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd now you\u2019re dragging poor Remus down with you,\u201d Mary laughed, \u201cCome and sit here, Lupin, I\u2019ll protect you from that delinquent.\u201d She budged up in her seat to make room by the window. Remus took the space gratefully.\n\n\n\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Peter asked, \u201cYou left me alone with Lily and James. I might as well have been a ghost.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGig. Stayed out late. Didn\u2019t sleep.\u201d Sirius waved a hand, yawning. He sat opposite Remus, and folded his arms, leaning tiredly against the window.\n\n\nThe train began to move, and Remus closed his eyes - because he was exhausted, but also because that way he didn\u2019t have to answer any more questions about where he\u2019d been. The girls began to speak more quietly, and he eventually drifted to sleep.\n\n\nWhen he woke up, they were already in Scotland, the dark rolling hills whooshing past, a smattering of rain hitting the windows.\n\n\nSirius was curled up on the seat opposite him, completely hidden under everyone else's cloaks. Remus could hear him breathing eveningly; fast asleep.\n\n\nMary was just sliding the door open as Remus stretched, waving at her sleepily. She smiled and waved back but looked serious. Marlene frowned,\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI just saw Lily,\u201d Mary whispered, \u201cSomething happened in the prefect carriage,\u201d she glanced over at Sirius, still just a lump underneath the cloaks, and lowered her voice even further so that Remus and Marlene had to lean in, \u201cJames and Regulus got into a fight. They\u2019re both ok, but it got quite nasty, by the sounds of it\u2026 Regulus was saying some really crazy stuff, Lily was really shaken.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of them,\u201d Marlene whispered, looking anxious, \u201cThe Black family are you-know-who\u2019s strongest supporters, everyone knows it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSh.\u201d Remus said, quickly, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what it was about. It could be anything.\u201d\n\n\nThe girls fell quiet after that, but exchanged concerned looks with each other and Remus could tell they thought he was being naive.\n\n\nHe leaned back and looked out of the window for a while, listening to Sirius\u2019s relaxed heartbeat and worrying about Grant and wishing more than anything that the worst was already behind them."

            "content": "Neither Remus, nor Peter - who had also been in the carriage - said anything to Sirius about Mary\u2019s intel. Peter probably kept quiet because he wasn\u2019t sure how valuable the information was. Remus kept quiet because he was a coward, and if there had to be bad news, he\u2019d prefer that James delivered it.\n\n\nAnd sure enough, James appeared to meet them all on the train platform with a very red looking eye, and a rumpled school uniform.\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Sirius yawned, oblivious.\n\n\n\u201cTell you later.\u201d James murmured, before jogging over to join Lily in herding the first years in the right direction.\n\n\nIt was still raining lightly, and growing dark already - Remus was very glad not to be crossing the lake. Still, it was bittersweet, climbing into the horseless carriages one last time with Sirius, Mary and Marlene (Peter had decided to follow the honey and get in with Dorcas and her friends). As they pulled into the castle courtyard Remus looked up at the towering stone and wondered if this would be his final memory of arriving at Hogwarts. Perhaps they would all be back for a reunion party in ten years. That was a pleasant thought, though 1987 seemed completely impossible right then.\n\n\nRemus tried to pay close attention to the sorting ceremony, the nervous line of tiny first years, the battered old hat, McGonagall\u2019s stern but caring countenance. He tried to imprint every moment in his memory - but it wasn\u2019t easy; there were so many distractions.\n\n\nFirst, there was James\u2019s eye, which he still had not explained. Then there was Regulus, who was conspicuously absent. Snape, glowering as always, his eyes never leaving the back of Lily Evans\u2019 head. Christopher, who kept trying to catch Remus\u2019s eye, and Sirius, who was completely unaware of everything else, and simply thrilled to be back at Hogwarts; his true home. Remus was trying to enjoy Sirius\u2019s good mood without looking too much like he was staring. It was a real art.\n\n\nJust as Dumbledore announced that dinner was served, the doors at the back of the hall flew open. All heads turned to see - except for Remus, who only needed to see the smile die on Sirius\u2019s face to know who it was.\n\n\nRegulus did not hurry to his seat, as Remus probably would have, embarrassed to draw attention. No, Regulus was a Black through and through, and walked with his usual regal bearing, slowly and with purpose, head held high. There was no evidence that James had done any damage, but Remus thought that Reg was looking even paler than usual, and dark around the eyes as if he had lost a lot of sleep lately. The sixth year Slytherins made a big show of making room for him, as if he was a guest of honour, rather than their school mate. Even Snape\u2019s attention was momentarily diverted, as he leaned across to shake Regulus\u2019s hand.\n\n\nAll of this took up only a few moments, but it left an indelible mark on the Gryffindor seventh years, as they all eyed Sirius warily.\n\n\n\u201cMate,\u201d James said, very quietly, \u201cI need to tell you something, later. In private.\u201d He glanced up at Remus and Peter as he said this, so that they knew they were included in this.\n\n\nSirius just nodded, and kept his head down for the rest of the meal, only picking at his food. Remus\u2019s heart ached, but there was nothing he could do. His sense of separation was inadvertently exacerbated by Lily and James, who kept squeezing each other\u2019s hands under the table. Remus didn\u2019t know when he and Sirius would next have the chance to be alone.\n\n\nAfter dinner it was an almost unbearable wait for Lily and James to finish up with their new duties as Head Boy and Girl. Remus was nodding in his armchair, failing to focus on his Care of Magical Creatures NEWT text, eyelids growing heavier and heavier.\n\n\n\u201cPsst, Moony,\u201d James woke him, finally, with a gentle shake, \u201cC\u2019mon, we\u2019re all heading up.\u201d\n\n\nRemus blinked, staring about himself in surprise - the common room was almost empty.\n\n\nUpstairs in their bedroom, all of their trunks had arrived, their beds were made and pyjamas laid out. Rain was still battering the window panes, and Remus could smell a storm on its way - electricity and pressure making the air feel thick and too close.\n\n\nSirius was pacing, and though a window was open the room stank of cigarettes from his chain smoking. He had showered at some point, and his hair was still damp at the ends, dripping onto the maroon t-shirt he wore to bed. Peter was just coming out of the bathroom, already in his pyjamas and smelling faintly of toothpaste.\n\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t wake me up.\u201d Remus said neutrally to Sirius. Sirius shrugged, carelessly, sitting down on his bed,\n\n\n\u201cYou looked comfortable. Thought you could probably do with the rest.\u201d He turned to James. \u201cWell?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about Regulus,\u201d James said, not beating about the bush.\n\n\n\u201cHe give you that?\u201d Sirius nodded at James\u2019s now very prominent black eye.\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d James nodded. He looked angry - a strange emotion on James. \u201cYeah, we had a few words in the prefect\u2019s carriage\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWords.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d James\u2019s jaw was tight, and the back of his neck was flushed red. He flexed his fists, \u201cSeems like Regulus and some of his mates have a problem with Evans being Head Girl.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Peter said, realising what had happened, \u201cJames, he didn\u2019t... \u201c\n\n\n\u201cHe was all talk.\u201d James said.\n\n\n\u201cBut you weren\u2019t.\u201d Sirius said. He was still sitting on the bed, his shoulders slumped.\n\n\n\u201cProngs!\u201d Remus sighed, impatiently, \u201cYou didn\u2019t attack him first?! You know that\u2019s exactly what that lot\n\n\nwant\n\n\nfrom our side. You should just have ignored him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t make it very easy.\u201d James snapped, still wound up. \u201cAnyway, don\u2019t bother, I\u2019ve had all this from Lily.\u201d\n\n\nRemus wondered what she had to say - he couldn\u2019t imagine that she would have taken very kindly to James playing the white knight. But then, Mary\n\n\nhad\n\n\nsaid she\u2019d been very shaken. \u201cI didn\u2019t\n\n\nhurt\n\n\nhim, anyway,\u201d James carried on. He had begun to pace the room, now that Sirius had stopped. \u201cJust wanted to shut him up - I was going to use\n\n\nsilencio\n\n\n, or maybe\n\n\nscourgify\n\n\nhis mouth, you know - but the little weasel dodged it and tried to get me back, so I used jelly-legs. That\u2019s when Mulciber swung for me, and Evans petrified all three of us. Just for a few minutes. Still, I got Regulus, so he had to go to the hospital wing and it all got written up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you in trouble?\u201d Peter asked, chewing his fingernails.\n\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d James waved a hand, \u201cLoads of witnesses said Reg was asking for it, and in the end it was Gryffindor vs. Slytherin so McGonagall and Slughorn agreed to give us another chance to \u2018be civil\u2019.\u201d He pulled a face at this.\n\n\n\u201cBut Reg is ok?\u201d Sirius asked, quietly.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, fine.\u201d James nodded. He stopped moving and scratched his head, awkwardly, \u201cThere\u2019s something else, though\u2026\u201d\n\n\nSirius looked up. His arms were folded across his body, but not in a defiant way - more as if to protect himself.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRegulus, when Lily petrified him he fell, and we had to lift him up onto a seat. He\u2019d rolled his sleeves up to duel, and when I was moving him, I saw\u2026 I saw\u2026 on his arm\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cProngs?\u201d Sirius was staring at his friend with such a burning in his eyes that his pupils were twin flames - he looked desperate, as if willing James not to tell him.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got the mark.\u201d\n\n\nPeter made a noise, and sat down hard on his bed. Remus bit his lip, and stayed still, because he couldn\u2019t think of anything else to do that wouldn\u2019t look suspicious.\n\n\nSirius swallowed - Remus could see his adam\u2019s apple bob - then looked down, then back up at James. Now he looked defiant. He gave another shrug, which was probably meant to be casual, except he was still hugging himself, so it just looked petulant. He tossed his hair,\n\n\n\u201cWell then.\u201d He said, \u201cS\u2019pose we know how my family spent their summer, then. Fine. That\u2019s fine. He\u2019s picked his side. I\u2019ve picked mine.\u201d He nodded, as if agreeing with himself. \u201cFine.\u201d He repeated.\n\n\n\u201cPadfoot,\u201d James reached out to his friend, \u201cI\u2019m angry with Reg, ok? I\u2019m not\u2026 it\u2019s nothing to do with you, everybody knows you\u2019re not one of them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Sirius said, almost violently. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d He squeezed his hands tighter over his arms and Remus felt dizzy with the urge to run over and wrap his own arms around him. \u201cIs Evans ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s fine.\u201d James said, \u201cI mean, I think she was hurt, but\u2026 well, she\u2019s tougher than me. Cooler under pressure.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWant me to have a word? With Reg, I mean?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d leave it, mate,\u201d James shook his head. \u201cMcGonagall and Slughorn know everything now, you\u2019ll only make it worse.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEverything?\u201d Sirius looked up again. The rims of his eyes were red - but that might just be tiredness.\n\n\n\u201cNot everything,\u201d James admitted, \u201cNot about the mark, I wanted to leave that up to you\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...Ok.\u201d Sirius looked down again. They were all quiet for a long time, before James tried again, heroically.\n\n\n\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sirius replied. \u201cI just want to go to bed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, good idea.\u201d James said, running his fingers through his hair.\n\n\nHe was doing the usual James-thing - taking charge, assessing and managing the Sirius-thing - but the wind was obviously out of his sails. He wasn\u2019t sure what to do. Remus wished he could tell him, telepathically; he knew\n\n\nexactly\n\n\nthe right thing. But it was a bad idea. No need to add his own nonsense to the pile. He would simply have to wait.\n\n\nThey all got ready for bed quietly, unpacking a few things, reclaiming their space on the bathroom counter, settling back into the comfortable and familiar room in which they had shared an entire childhood. Remus took a quick shower, to wash London off him, then brushed his teeth and dressed for bed.\n\n\nWhen he opened the door again, he found the curtains drawn around all of the beds except his own. Light snoring was coming from Peter\u2019s, but James and Sirius were still awake. If Remus concentrated very hard, he could even sense how they were lying (James on his back, tossing his lucky golden snitch up and down, Sirius curled up on his side), and how relaxed they were (not at all). That felt like an invasion of privacy, though, so he just tried to creep as quietly as possible to his own four-poster, looking forward to a proper rest at last.\n\n\nNo such luck.\n\n\n\u201cRemus.\u201d Sirius\u2019s head popped out from behind his curtains. Remus turned his head,\n\n\n\u201cSirius.\u201d He whispered back.\n\n\nSirius pulled back the curtain and - after a quick glance at the other beds - Remus climbed in as neatly as he could. Inside it was pitch dark, but he could still see Sirius\u2019s warm outline, kneeling before him. He twitched his wand.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nSonoro Quiescis\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJames isn\u2019t asleep yet,\u201d Remus cautioned, \u201cAre you sure you want me--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sirius replied, \u201cPlease stay, just for a little bit.\u201d He reached out and grasped Remus\u2019s hand, squeezing it. Remus relented and finally put his arms around Sirius, pulling him closer. It was an immense relief.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about Reg.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not even of age!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\nThey pulled apart, and sat cross legged, facing each other. Sirius\u2019s head was bowed, his hair covering his face. He probably remembered how well Remus could see in the dark.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe\u2026 I know it\u2019s stupid, I should have known all along that he would, but\u2026 I dunno, I suppose I just hoped he\u2019d\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid.\u201d Remus said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t know he joined willingly. Remember what they did to you, when they wanted\n\n\nyou\n\n\nto join him.\u201d\n\n\nSirius flinched, but didn\u2019t move away.\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He murmured. \u201cI doubt it got that far with Reg. He was always\u2026 he always wanted it more than me. The whole circus; our parent\u2019s approval, the respect you get from purebloods just for being a Black. We like to be popular, and powerful. It only makes sense. That\u2019s why we\u2019re all Slytherins.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nYou\u2019re\n\n\nnot a Slytherin.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d Sirius exhaled, shakily, \u201cI used to think\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI used to think\u2026 maybe I didn\u2019t get sorted into Gryffindor because I\u2019m brave, or chivalrous, like James is. Maybe I just wasn\u2019t welcome in Slytherin because I haven\u2019t got the ambition.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAmbition?!\u201d Remus stared at him, \u201cSirius, what Reg is doing, it isn\u2019t\u2026 it\u2019s not anything to be proud of. It\u2019s cowardly; he\u2019s doing exactly what he\u2019s been raised to do, without thinking, without\n\n\nquestioning\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re the bravest person I know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMoony\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally.\u201d Remus said this with such seriousness that it stopped Sirius in his tracks.\n\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Sirius smiled. He reached forward again, plucking the fabric of Remus\u2019s pyjama bottoms and sniffing slightly. \u201cI thought that keeping quiet about you and me would be the hardest thing about this year,\u201d he said, \u201cForgot about the stupid war.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. He wished he could forget about the war too. Sirius looked up at him, sensing his unease,\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still hard.\u201d He said, \u201cKeeping this quiet,\u201d his fingers kept playing with the cuffs of Remus\u2019s trouser leg. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re so far apart, when the others are around.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty close right now,\u201d Remus offered, hoping to cheer him up a bit. It worked. Sirius took this as an invitation and finally met his eye, grinning. He leaned over and as their lips met Remus forced himself to forget about everything else, just for a little bit.\n\n\nAfterwards, they found themselves crawling under the covers for warmth, sleepy and affectionate.\n\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t get too comfortable,\u201d Remus yawned, \u201cI\u2019d better go back to my bed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Sirius whispered, shyly.\n\n\n\u201cOk.\u201d His eyes were very heavy, though. He was in real danger of falling asleep.\n\n\n\u201cRemus?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTell me a secret.\u201d Sirius\u2019s fingers curled around his.\n\n\n\u201cUm. I dunno.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGo on. Something good. Happy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Perhaps now was the right time. He didn\u2019t like to bring up the Black family, but after all, it wasn\u2019t about Regulus or Walpurga. \u201cI could tell you about something I did in my second year, if you won\u2019t get angry\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPromise you won\u2019t get angry. It\u2019s a bit\u2026 well, remember I was thirteen, and I only wanted to help.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMerlin, Moony, just tell me!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNarcissa,\u201d he said, \u201cI um\u2026 I gave her the idea to use the unbreakable vow. You know, to get out of the engagement.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe\n\n\nengagement, not\n\n\nyour\n\n\nengagement, because that was still too painful.\n\n\nSirius was quiet. Remus bit his lip, and turned his head on the pillow to get a look at Sirius\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry for interfering\u2026 But you gave me that reading spell, and you were so\u2026 I just thought you were so amazing and clever and brave, I wanted to do something to help you for once.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t want to tell me about it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI, er\u2026 no, I didn\u2019t. At first I didn\u2019t want to boast about it. Then so much time had passed, it just didn\u2019t seem worth it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMoony!\u201d Sirius exhaled again - exasperated this time. \u201cHonestly, you and your secrets!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry,\u201d Sirius chuckled, yawning again and shifting slightly to get comfortable, \u201cI s\u2019pose I did ask. And\u2026 that\u2019s bloody impressive. I couldn\u2019t have come up with that, at thirteen.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t.\u201d Remus smirked.\n\n\n\u201cSo you actually went and talked to my cousin?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah. She was terrifying.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStill is.\u201d Sirius snorted. \u201cThey all bloody are.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think about it now,\u201d Remus chastised him, \u201cOr I\u2019ll have to cheer you up again, and I can\u2019t think of any more secrets tonight.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere are other ways\u2026\u201d Sirius replied, slyly. Remus laughed, hoping the silencing spell was still secure.\n\n\n\u201cHarlot.\u201d"

And I haven\u2019t learnt\n\n\nanything\n\n\n.\u201d Remus said, as he frantically looked for the right passage in his History books.\n\n\nThere were twelve of them open, currently, and he couldn\u2019t remember which had the best counter argument for the 1382 Pixie Relocation Act. Seven of the books lay open on the desk in front of him, taking up almost all of the space. Five more hovered in mid air, at eye level so that he could check for references as he went.\n\n\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t learnt anything, then what chance have the rest of us got?\u201d Christopher smiled peacefully from his spot on the floor. He was sitting cross-legged, books on the carpet in front of him.\n\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t learnt anything useful.\u201d Remus replied, impatiently, still searching.\n\n\n\u201cHow are we defining useful?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnything that will help me pass my NEWTs.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, because you really buggered up your OWLs\u2026\u201d Christopher tutted sarcastically.\n\n\n\u201cNEWTs are completely different.\u201d Remus countered, finally locating the passage he needed, now losing his quill. \u201c\n\n\nNastily exhausting\u2026\n\n\n\u201d He found his quill (behind his ear, embarrassingly enough), but now\u2026 \u201cShit.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Christopher looked up.\n\n\n\u201cLost my inkwell\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou ought to get one of those self-inking quills. We can look in Hogsmeade, next weekend if you fancy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, why not\u2026\u201d Remus continued lifting books.\n\n\n\u201cHere, I\u2019ve got a pencil if it\u2019s just note taking\u2026\u201d Christopher crawled underneath the desk now to find his book bag. Remus felt a bit guilty then, for taking up all the space.\n\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d He said, stepping back from the madness for a moment, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019ll all be fine once we get the study group up and running again\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTalking to yourself, Moony?\u201d James and Sirius appeared in quidditch robes (Sirius was still officially off the team, but nothing was stopping him from using the pitch on off days, and at least it kept him distracted.)\n\n\n\u201cMerlin\u2019s wrinkly ballsack.\u201d Sirius said, staring at Remus\u2019s desk. \u201cYou can\u2019t have this much homework after the first week?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m reading around my subject.\u201d Remus replied, irritable again.\n\n\n\u201cHere you are, Remus,\u201d Christopher reappeared from under the table, brandishing a pencil.\n\n\n\u201cCheers!\u201d Remus took it and began to scribble away onto his parchment.\n\n\n\u201cOh, hello Black,\u201d Christopher nodded politely, ducking his head.\n\n\nRemus glanced up, mid-scribble. Sirius was looking at Christopher with a bored kind of disdain.\n\n\n\u201cHello.\u201d He nodded. He looked at Remus, \u201cStudy group, is it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, just ordinary studying today,\u201d Remus explained. \u201cBut I was just saying we ought to set up a meeting soon - if people still want to do it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course they will!\u201d Christopher said, eagerly, \u201cYou got half of us through our OWLs last year.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius said, out of the blue. He looked thoughtful, which was dangerous. \u201cYeah, I might join this year. What\u2019dyou think, Prongs?\u201d\n\n\nJamus looked up from the sofa, where he was polishing his broom.\n\n\n\u201cMate, I\u2019m busy enough as it is! --Sorry, Remus.\u201d\n\n\nRemus shrugged. He looked at Sirius,\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d hate being in a study group.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll never know unless I try, will I? And you\u2019re always saying it\u2019s such an important year.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm, I\u2019ve been saying that for the past three years, actually\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s finally sunk in!\u201d Sirius grinned. That Sirius Black grin. Even with everything between them now, it was completely disarming. \u201cBesides,\u201d Sirius continued, looking at Christopher now, \u201cI might be able to impart some of my wisdom.\u201d\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t argue it any further. He\u2019d learnt his lesson - you couldn\u2019t tell Sirius anything; just had to let him work it out for himself. And\n\n\nyes\n\n\n, he probably wanted to join the study group because Christopher was in it. But after all;\n\n\nSirius\n\n\nhad made the choice to keep the relationship quiet;\n\n\nSirius\n\n\nwas choosing to pretend that he really did want to do homework. Remus would just go along with it.\n\n\nIn the meantime, Remus felt as though he was limping through the first half of the term. He had not been so overwhelmed by his curriculum since his first year. Everything seemed ten times more involved \u00a0than it had been the year before, and the essay requirements were at least ten inches longer. He felt suddenly very guilty about spending the entire summer relaxing and pleasing himself, when all the while time had been ticking away.\n\n\nEven having dropped Potions, Astronomy and Herbology, there was still Arithmancy, History, Charms, Transfiguration, Defence Against the Dark Arts and Care of Magical Creatures; all of which seemed to have reached new heights of complexity as the final year got into full swing. Not to mention the extra lessons he was taking with Madam Pomfrey.\n\n\nNot for the first time, Remus was extremely glad he was no longer a prefect, as he found himself spending almost all of his time squirrelled away in the bowels of the library, squinting over ancient texts with dust in his hair. He stayed through his free lessons, half of his lunch break, and more often than not was still there until Madam Pince chased him out.\n\n\nIn the end, he was thrilled to meet up with his study group again, just to have a bit of human company.\n\n\n\u201cThere you are!\u201d Christopher met him outside the Charms classroom after lessons on a Thursday. Professor Flitwick had been kind enough to hand over his classroom for another year.\n\n\n(\u201cI\u2019ve no doubt you\u2019ll have a classroom of your own, one day, young Lupin!\u201d the tiny teacher had squeaked cheerily. Remus blushed and did not comment. One day his secret would be out; everyone would know why he was not fit to teach, or even be in a school at all, and then what?)\n\n\n\u201cHere I am,\u201d Remus replied to Chris with a smile, \u201cWere you looking for me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot particularly, just haven\u2019t seen much of you for the past week. Not even in the common room.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been there reading for an hour a night,\u201d Remus said, \u201c...but only once the library is closed.\u201d And before Sirius came down yawning at one o\u2019clock telling him to go to bed.\n\n\n\u201cAdmirable dedication,\u201d Christopher nodded as they entered the room and began rearranging it to their liking. \u201cBut don\u2019t go too hard, ok? Try to enjoy your last year a bit!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI enjoy studying.\u201d Remus said, firmly, unpacking his books. This wasn\u2019t exactly a lie, but he knew he sounded defensive.\n\n\nThe truth was; he knew he was working harder than he needed to, and for longer hours. But it was better than lying awake all night worrying about the various other problems that plagued him. He still hadn\u2019t heard from Grant - though that could just be the vagaries of muggle post. He hadn\u2019t given any proper thought to his mother yet, though he knew he really ought to. There had been three reports of werewolf attacks over the summer, and one arrest made. When it came down to it, NEWTs were the only thing Remus thought he could really cope with at the moment.\n\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t actually think anyone had really\n\n\nmissed\n\n\nhim, exactly - after all, they were very busy too. Lily and James had a whole host of new responsibilities, on top of their NEWTs. Lily was taking Advanced Potions, James had quidditch. Peter and Dorcas were on-again-off-again, but it seemed to keep him pretty occupied, and Marlene was working harder than ever this year in the lead up to her healer academy entrance exams. Mary, of course, had a new boyfriend, which kept her busy.\n\n\n\u201cYou need a break.\u201d Christopher was saying, taking his own seat next to Remus, like his second in command. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk,\u201d Remus nodded, as if he was really taking it in.\n\n\nIt was alright for Christopher; he was a pureblood. Even if he didn\u2019t work as hard as he did, there was probably a cushy ministry job waiting for him once he finished school. If Remus worked every hour of the day, and got an O in every NEWT, he still didn\u2019t see much of a future beyond part time work and depending on his friends for help. That\u2019s if Greyback didn\u2019t get him first, or if the ministry didn\u2019t lock him up.\n\n\nThe other students began arriving, so they could stop talking about it. It was a smaller group than last year, but still a good round dozen. You couldn't expect everyone to show up for the first week. Sirius did come, much to Remus\u2019s surprise, and the girls\u2019 delight.\n\n\n\u201cSit here, Sirius!\u201d Martha Eriksson, a fifth year Hufflepuff, waved at him.\n\n\nSirius smiled politely and acquiesced, placing himself directly opposite Remus in the horseshoe of desks. Remus nodded at him, and tried not to hold eye contact for too long before gently clearing his throat and addressing the room.\n\n\n\u201cHi everyone,\u201d he smiled, looking about, \u201cNice to see you all back. Er. Shall we start by picking a subject? Anyone struggling with anything?\u201d\n\n\nThe fifth years were all having a bad time with Astronomy, and Christopher volunteered to walk them through Eudoxus\u2019s theories on planetary movements. Three of the sixth years were stuck on a History essay, and the second years wanted help with Transfiguration.\n\n\n\u201cOk,\u201d Remus said to the sixth years, \u201cIf you lot can wait a bit, I\u2019ll just get these two going on the Transfiguration stuff first\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can do that,\u201d Sirius said, suddenly.\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Remus blinked, raising a skeptical eyebrow.\n\n\n\u201cReally.\u201d Sirius replied, coolly, \u201cI\u2019m better at Transfiguration than you, anyway.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, ok then\u2026\u201d\n\n\nThe two second years looked very pleased to have Sirius Black, whose reputation as school rebel and general heartthrob preceded him, paying them attention, though Martha Eriksson looked a bit peeved.\n\n\nThe session, booked in for two hours, went very well, in Remus\u2019s opinion. He tried not to hover over Sirius too much, though there was a lot of laughter and noise coming from that corner of the room. By the end everyone seemed to have achieved whatever they had wanted to achieve, and Sirius even stayed behind to help tidy the room.\n\n\n\u201cWill you be ok here?\u201d Christopher asked Remus, \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be patrolling with Lily.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Sirius said, with what he probably thought was a very sweet smile, but was bordering on mania.\n\n\n\u201cOk good.\u201d Christopher gave him a haughty glance, before returning to Remus, \u201cSee you Saturday for stationery shopping?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGreat, yeah, meet you in the common room after breakfast.\u201d Remus nodded, helping Sirius push a desk back into place.\n\n\n\u201cSee you!\u201d\n\n\nAs soon as the door closed, Sirius stopped what he was doing and placed his hands on his hips, scowling.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to Hogsmeade with him?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI said I would.\u201d Remus frowned, taken aback, \u201cI need a new quill. What\u2019s the problem? I can meet you lot after we shop for quills, can\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut I thought you and me would\u2026 I\u2019ve hardly seen you this week.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be alone, James and Peter would be there. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m taking anything away from you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLily and James will be off by themselves. And Peter and Dorcas, probably.\u201d Sirius was in real danger of pouting, now. Remus knew he ought to try and avoid a sulk, if he could.\n\n\n\u201cYou can join me and Christopher, if you want.\u201d He said. Sirius grimaced.\n\n\n\u201cStationery shopping.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou need quills too. The only reason I keep running out is because you pinch all of mine.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut Moony\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not jealous, are you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d Sirius shook his head, and returned to the desks, using his wand to return everything to order. He sighed, heavily, \u201cI\u2019ll come stationery shopping, then.\u201d\n\n\nRemus felt a pang of guilt.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see if I can get rid of Chris after. Or we could find the others and go for a drink?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\n\n\nnot\n\n\ngoing to Madam Puddifoot\u2019s.\u201d Sirius said darkly, a hint of humour returning to his face. Remus smiled and slapped him on the shoulder,\n\n\n\u201cGood. Or I\u2019d have to stop fancying you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAs if you could.\u201d Sirius took his wrist and pulled him closer, kissing him hard on the lips.\n\n\n\nOh\n\n\n, Remus thought,\n\n\nwe haven\u2019t done this in a while.\n\n\nHe felt really guilty, then. Perhaps Sirius was right - he\u2019d been so wrapped up in everything else he\u2019d neglected the one thing that might have made it all a bit more bearable.\n\n\nThey pulled apart and Sirius glanced at the door, licking his lips.\n\n\n\u201cDo you have to run off to the library or somewhere?\u201d\n\n\nRemus shook his head. Sirius grinned. \u201cGood.\n\n\nColloportus\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nThe lock in the door clicked shut.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nSaturday 17th September 1977\n\n\n\u201cHave you charmed your bloody curtains shut, you lunatic?!\u201d James voice woke Remus and Sirius the Saturday of the Hogsmeade trip.\n\n\nRemus sat up bolt upright, eyes wide. He stared at the curtains, which shook as James attempted to get in. Sirius took a more casual approach, rolling over slowly and groaning,\n\n\n\u201cBugger off, Potter.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll miss breakfast!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBe down in a bit.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHogsmeade today, remember! Common room at ten o\u2019clock sharp.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPiss\n\n\noff\n\n\n, Prongs!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCharming.\u201d James muttered, but the curtains stopped shaking, and in a few moments his footsteps could be heard receding, disappearing down the stairs.\n\n\nRemus exhaled. He pressed a hand to his chest, feeling his heart thudding hard, and willed it to calm down.\n\n\n\u201cChrist.\u201d He breathed.\n\n\n\u201cBit jumpy there, Moony?\u201d Sirius grinned, rolling onto his back and stretching his arms over his head.\n\n\n\u201cI really need to stop falling asleep here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fine. The charm held, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou and James have boundary issues.\u201d Remus pulled back the heavy bedclothes.\n\n\n\u201cProbably. Hey, don\u2019t go!\u201d Sirius reached out for his arm.\n\n\n\u201cBreakfast!\u201d Remus insisted, fishing about for his underwear.\n\n\nThey washed, dressed and hurried down to the Great Hall, just in time for the last few scraps of toast and a few dollops of porridge.\n\n\n\u201cI expect it of Black, but it\u2019s not like you to miss a meal, Remus,\u201d Lily commented, skimming her copy of\n\n\nThe Daily Prophet\n\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cI was up late reading.\u201d Remus said. \u201cI can have a lie in on a Saturday, if I want\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWasn\u2019t saying you couldn\u2019t.\u201d She tutted, as if he was being over-sensitive. She lowered the paper, \u201cI was patrolling with Christopher Barley yesterday evening. He mentioned you were going to Hogsmeade together today\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMmph?\u201d Remus looked up at her gormlessly, mouth full of toast and honey.\n\n\nWhat fresh hell? Everyone was looking at him, suddenly, with varying degrees of amused curiosity. He swallowed. \u201cYeah. Just to Scrivenshaft\u2019s, I need a new quill.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGet on quite well, don\u2019t you?\u201d Lily asked, innocently.\n\n\n\u201cWe do the study group together\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDid\n\n\nhe\n\n\nask\n\n\nyou\n\n\n, Remus?\u201d Mary joined in.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, c\u2019mon,\u201d she grinned, \u201cChris is definitely\u2026\n\n\nyou\n\n\nknow; \u2018that way\u2019. He\u2019s so camp.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs he?\u201d Remus asked, uncomfortably. \u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed. We\u2019re just buying quills, nothing else.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut if he fancies you--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMerlin, leave him alone, will you?!\u201d Sirius said, hotly, glaring at both girls, \u201cJust because Christopher is\u2026 whatever, doesn\u2019t mean Moony automatically has to go out with him. He\u2019s not\n\n\nthat\n\n\ndesperate.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOi,\u201d Remus said, relieved by the interruption, \u201cWho says I\u2019m desperate at all?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Sirius nodded, \u201cSee? He\u2019s not interested.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, but Chris is really nice,\u201d Lily said, \u201cI thought you\u2019d make a good couple. Similar interests and whatnot.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe Moony doesn\u2019t\n\n\nwant\n\n\nto go out with someone similar.\u201d Sirius interjected, setting down his coffee mug a bit harder than necessary.\n\n\nRemus surreptitiously put a hand on his knee under the table, hoping to quiet him. Sirius glanced at him, then looked down at his plate. Thankfully, he got the message.\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let stuff like that bother you.\u201d Remus whispered on the way back to the common room, as soon as the others were out of earshot.\n\n\n\u201cIt should bother\n\n\nyou\n\n\n.\u201d Sirius replied, still wound up.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, but you need to learn to be more subtle if we\u2019re going to--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, we\u2019re back to\n\n\nthis\n\n\nagain.\u201d Sirius sighed, heavily, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not as good at all this undercover bullshit as you are.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Remus stared at him. Sirius shoved his hands in his pockets and muttered,\n\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d He sped up, catching up with James and leaving Remus to walk by himself.\n\n\n\u201cEverything ok?\u201d Lily slowed down, as James and Sirius began chattering animatedly ahead of them.\n\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d Remus replied.\n\n\nHe was in a mood now. Who did Sirius think he was, complaining about how difficult it was to keep secrets, when it was all his idea to keep the relationship quiet in the first place?! He ought to just go off with Chris and ignore Sirius for the rest of the day - that would serve him right.\n\n\n\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Lily was asking.\n\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSirius,\u201d Lily nodded ahead at the two black haired boys in front, \u201cIs he being a prat? Because I will give James permission to box his ears, if he\u2019s acting weird about you being\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, no, nothing like that,\u201d Remus waved a hand and forced on a smile, \u201cIt was something else. Stupid stuff, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\n\nChristopher was waiting in the common room, a shy smile on his face. Remus smiled back, bounding over to him. \u201cReady?\u201d He asked, brightly.\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Chris nodded, excited, \u201cI\u2019ve got a list of books I wanted to look for, too - if that\u2019s ok with you? I mean, if you have time, before you have to meet your friends\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re my friend too, Chris.\u201d Remus said, hoping Sirius overheard.\n\n\nIt was a nice day out, sunny for late September, with only a very faint chill in the air, meaning that by the time the students had trekked down to the village most of them were warm enough to have removed their heavy cloaks. Remus kept his on, because he rarely took off any layers, but Chris shrugged his off once they reached the first row of shops,\n\n\n\u201cOoooh, look at him!\u201d A sharp wolf-whistle sounded behind them. They both spun around to see Barty Crouch and Regulus Black not far away, both snickering meanly.\n\n\n\u201cIgnore them.\u201d Chris muttered to Remus, \u201cThey\u2019re in my Potions class, they\u2019re dickheads.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Remus said, \u201cLet\u2019s see your list\u2026\u201d\n\n\nThey passed a pleasant couple of hours together untroubled by anyone. Remus bought one of the fancy self-inking quills, as well as an ordinary one as a backup. They went to the book shop next and Christopher bought so much that he had to perform a weightlessness charm on the bag just to carry it all back.\n\n\n\u201cMy trunk\u2019s nearly full already,\u201d he laughed, \u201cWhat with all of the muggle books I brought with me. Have you read\n\n\nOther Voices, Other Rooms\n\n\n?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t do much reading this summer\u2026\u201d\n\n\nEverything was going pretty well, until they decided to head for the Three Broomsticks as a final stop. Remus was feeling almost like forgiving Sirius, by now, having calmed down, though he was a bit apprehensive about seeing the others with Christopher.\n\n\n\u201cLily said you\u2019d told her about us coming to Hogsmeade\u2026\u201d he said, casually. Christopher furrowed his brow,\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I think it just came up in conversation.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know she\u2019s one of my best friends,\u201d Remus said, hoping he didn\u2019t sound too much like he was accusing Chris of anything, \u201cSo... she knows I\u2019m queer\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm, she knows I am too.\u201d Christopher said. \u201cOr I assume she does. Most people figured it out before me, I think. Lily\u2019s a really nice girl, though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Remus nodded. \u201cThing is, I think she thought this was\u2026 um\u2026 y\u2019know, like we were coming to Hogsmeade\n\n\ntogether\n\n\n. So\u2026 just, if we see my friends, they might act a bit funny.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Chris said, looking confused, \u201cEr\u2026 ok? Would you rather we didn\u2019t go to the pub, in case they\u2019re there?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Remus said, quickly - he knew he was making a pig\u2019s ear of explaining himself, \u201cI just meant--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHere they come!\u201d That mean voice interrupted them again. They\u2019d just turned a corner, and found their path blocked by the two sixth year Slytherins.\n\n\n\u201cOh, get lost, will you?\u201d Remus sighed, impatiently. \u201cGo and find someone else to annoy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWatch out, Loony Lupin,\u201d Regulus cackled, \u201c\n\n\nChrissy boy\n\n\nthere is a knob-gobbler!\u201d\n\n\nChris turned bright red and looked at his feet. In a fit of rage, Remus withdrew his wand and adopted a duelling stance.\n\n\n\u201cPiss off, Black!\u201d He shouted, \u201cOr I\u2019ll tell mummy you still play quidditch!\u201d\n\n\nRegulus scowled, and pulled out his own wand.\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d another voice added, \u201cAnd\n\n\nI\u2019ll\n\n\ntell all your creepy mates how you wet the bed until you were ten!\u201d Sirius appeared at Remus\u2019s shoulder. Remus laughed.\n\n\n\u201cIs that true?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYup.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Regulus burst out, angrily. He didn\u2019t go red when he was embarrassed, but turn a shade paler. \u201c\n\n\nFlagrante!\n\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nProtego\n\n\n!\u201d Sirius yelled, deflecting the curse just in time.\n\n\n\u201cJust you wait!\u201d Regulus growled, backing away.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you gonna do, give me detention?\u201d Sirius laughed, \u201cI\u2019m quaking in my boots. Run along, little brother.\u201d\n\n\nRegulus clenched his fists.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re no brother of mine!\u201d He spat, as he turned and stalked away, Barty following him, looking annoyed that he hadn\u2019t had his own fun.\n\n\n\u201cSuits me.\u201d Sirius said, quietly, under his breath. He turned to Remus and Chris, \u201cThree Broomsticks?\u201d"

            "content": "It couldn\u2019t have been a coincidence that Sirius had shown up at exactly the right moment, but Remus was so relieved at the time that he didn\u2019t bring it up. Sirius was being so friendly towards Chris, and Remus didn\u2019t want to start any kind of argument. Whatever had been up that morning had clearly been a fluke; everything was fine, everyone was happy.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s still allowed to be a prefect.\u201d Lily said, fiercely, when she heard what had happened with Regulus. \u201cHe\u2019s been worse than ever this year - and don\u2019t get me started on the Crouch kid, he gives me the creeps.\u201d She shuddered visibly, and James put a gallant arm around her shoulders.\n\n\nChristopher shrugged, nervously,\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I can handle those two idiots.\u201d\n\n\nThey hadn\u2019t mentioned what Regulus had actually said during their retelling, at Chris\u2019s request. Still, he looked a bit overwhelmed, sitting with all four marauders and the Head Girl in The Three Broomsticks. Christopher\u2019s own social circle was quite small, and generally much quieter.\n\n\n\u201cOught to teach them a lesson,\u201d Sirius said, signalling to Rosmerta for another round of butterbeer.\n\n\n\u201cAnother one,\u201d Remus sighed, under his breath.\n\n\n\u201cWhat sort of thing were you thinking, Pads?\u201d James leaned over, excited.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d need to think\n\n\nvery\n\n\nhard.\u201d Sirius said, stroking his chin thoughtfully, like an old professor.\n\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t done a prank in ages,\u201d Peter put in, eyes gleaming, \u201cNot since\u2026 er\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe Bubotuber-puffballs.\u201d Remus provided, sipping his drink.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s best if you just cover your ears, Christopher,\u201d Lily advised wryly, \u201cThere\u2019s no stopping them once they\u2019re in planning-mode.\u201d\n\n\nRemus poked out his tongue at her. It was true enough; he was already starting to get those familiar butterflies in his stomach that he always did when the marauders embarked on a new mission.\n\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone\u2026 would you?\u201d Chris looked anxiously at Sirius and James, who were doing their telepathic communication thing, grinning at each other like loons and waggling their eyebrows.\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you looking at us for?!\u201d Sirius winked, \u201c\n\n\nMoony\u2019s\n\n\nthe dangerous one.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow dare you.\u201d Remus replied, smirking, \u201cEveryone knows that you three lead me astray. Anyway, it\u2019s seventh year, and we\u2019ve done everything there is to do.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHave some imagination!\u201d James said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m hearing this from the boy who once\n\n\nliterally changed time\n\n\njust for a laugh.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat was you?!\u201d Chris yelped, looking affronted. Remus tutted,\n\n\n\u201cI did not \u2018literally\u2019 do anything. We mucked about with the clocks.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhen you were eleven,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cYou single-handedly organised and implemented a full scale itching powder attack on the Slytherin boys.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRosehip seeds.\u201d Remus corrected.\n\n\n\u201cAnd!\u201d Peter added, bouncing excitedly, \u201cYou were the one who perfected the soap expansion spell when we blew up all the toilets in second year.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk, yeah, I helped with that\u2026 it was a team effort!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus, wasn\u2019t it\n\n\nyou\n\n\nwho invented that word-swapping spell to stop the Slytherins using insults?\u201d Lily asked, smiling sweetly at him, tongue between her teeth.\n\n\n\u201cOh, I liked that one!\u201d Chris cheered up a bit.\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\n\n\ninvent\n\n\nit.\u201d Remus said, \u201cI just\u2026 er\u2026 did the research.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSee.\u201d James said to Christopher. \u201cMoony is our criminal mastermind. Without him, we wouldn\u2019t be the legends we are today.\u201d\n\n\nChristopher stared at Remus, evidently seeing him in a completely new light. Remus sighed, heavily.\n\n\n\u201cI hate you all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ll help us with another prank?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...Yes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll help too!\u201d Chris said, suddenly, looking happier than he had in hours.\n\n\n\u201cOh for goodness\u2019 sake.\u201d Lily groaned. \u201cI suppose\n\n\nsomeone\n\n\nhad better monitor you lot, if only for health and safety\u2026 I\u2019m in.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExcellent.\u201d James beamed.\n\n\nRemus smiled back at them all, trying to ignore the feeling of anxiety growing in his chest.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nMonday 3rd October 1977\n\n\n\nDear Remus,\n\n\n\n\nSorry I did not write sooner I have been very busy. Sorry too for my bad writing. I am at my aunt Val\u2019s pub in Hove and its very nice. Shes letting me work here and stay in her spare room but I will move out on my own when I have some mony saved. I hope you will come to see me when you can. You can ring me on the number at the bottom if you like.\n\n\nI hope school is ok. I hope\nSyri\n\nSirus\n\nSiry\nyour friend with the long hair is taking care of you as well as you took care of me.\n\n\nLots of love from Grant Chapman.\n\n\n\n\nP.S. Did you here that Marc Bolan died? It was a car crash. I thought of you when I herd and I hoped you was not too sad.\n\n\n\n\nRemus held the letter, written on a bit of narrow ruled paper torn from an exercise book, and sighed with relief. He folded it neatly and slipped it in his pocket, grinning to himself. Grant was safe. Grant was\n\n\nsafe\n\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cWho was that from?\u201d James asked, catching Remus\u2019s smile.\n\n\n\u201cA friend from St Edmund\u2019s,\u201d Remus replied easily. Sirius looked up, and Remus gave a very slight nod. Sirius smiled too. Remus cleared his throat and returned to his breakfast, \u201cMarc Bolan died.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh no!\u201d Mary, Lily and Sirius said in unison.\n\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s--\u201d James started,\n\n\n\u201cThe singer from T.Rex.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah! Wasn\u2019t that the muggle band you two were obsessed with in first year?\u201d\n\n\nMary tutted, rolling her eyes,\n\n\n\u201cBloody purebloods.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOi.\u201d Sirius said, nudging her with his elbow. \u201cThat\u2019s really crap news, though. Hey,\n\n\nI\n\n\nknow what we should d--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Lily said, suddenly, \u201cI know that look, Black!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He painted on his most innocent expression. Lily was not fooled.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nNo\n\n\nparties.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh come\n\n\non\n\n\n, Evans, it\u2019s for--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I told James.\u201d She shook her head, \u201cBirthdays are fine, but not during exams, and not this early in the year!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cProngs?!\u201d Sirius glared at his friend. James looked awkward,\n\n\n\u201cSorry, mate, I did agree to that\u2026 y\u2019know Head Boy and everything\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBetrayal!\u201d Sirius pointed at him dramatically, \u201cTreachery! Treason!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAll right, calm it down\u2026\u201d Lily stood up. \u201cI\u2019m letting you have your birthday, aren\u2019t I? Leave James alone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou off?\u201d James looked up at her.\n\n\n\u201cPotions.\u201d She replied, \u201cI want to get there early to ask Slughorn something.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk you.\u201d James stood up too, eagerly. Sirius frowned, but James was oblivious. He took Lily\u2019s hand, and without looking away from her, \u201cSee you in a bit, Pads? And see you at lunch, Moony\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSee ya,\u201d Remus nodded, reaching for some more toast.\n\n\nSirius stared after the couple as they left the hall, heads bent close as they chatted happily.\n\n\n\u201cCan you believe that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Remus buttered his toast and mused on the merits of honey versus jam.\n\n\n\u201cProngs not wanting a party!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, it is quite early in the year\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis time last year he\u2019d have been all for it. It\u2019s her.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d Mary laughed, \u201cI know what\u2019s wrong with you, Mr Black.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with me, I\u2019m the same as I ever was, it\u2019s--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d She arched her eyebrow at him, \u201cYou\n\n\nnever\n\n\nchange. You\u2019re jealous.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPfft.\u201d Sirius folded his arms and slouched down in his seat. His legs stretched out under the table and bumped against Remus\u2019s. \u201cAs if I would be jealous of\n\n\nhim\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot of\n\n\nJames\n\n\n,\u201d Mary rolled her eyes, \u201cYou\u2019re jealous of Lily. She\u2019s taken your best friend away and now you\u2019re feeling neglected, right?\u201d\n\n\nSirius went very quiet. He looked down, then back up at Mary.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n\u201d He said, very fiercely, getting up. \u201cI\u2019m going to Potions.\u201d He muttered, stalking off, away from the breakfast table. Mary sighed deeply, in that that girls did when they thought boys were being particularly dense.\n\n\n\u201cHonestly.\u201d She tutted. \u201cYou agree with me, don\u2019t you, Remus?\u201d\n\n\nRemus shrugged. He just wanted to eat his breakfast in peace. Mary tutted at him, too. \u201c\n\n\nBoys\n\n\n.\u201d She said, exasperated, \u201cEmotional cripples, the lot of you. Right, I\u2019ve got a free this morning, going to the library. You?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, but I had something else I wanted to do.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d she smiled, getting up and leaving too.\n\n\nFinally alone, Remus\u2019s mind began to work, the beginnings of an idea forming. He didn\u2019t disagree with Lily exactly - the parties were a massive distraction, and not really fair on everyone else. But at the same time, he hated seeing Sirius\u2019s excitement quashed; particularly by James, who had always been a wholly positive force in his life.\n\n\nHe couldn\u2019t help but feel that he, Remus, ought to be able to do something to cheer Sirius up. After all, he\u2019d done madder things before. But what to do...\n\n\nTo distract himself, he re-read Grant\u2019s letter as he finished eating, then wrote a quick response.\n\n\n\nDear Grant,\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your letter. I\u2019m so glad everything is going well with your aunt.\n\n\n\n\nI would love to come and see you at Christmas, if not then, over the summer maybe. I will try to call as soon as I am able to - hopefully the first weekend in November.\n\n\n\n\nCrap news about Bolan! Thanks for telling me, we get no news here.\n\n\n\n\nSpeak soon,\n\n\n\n\nRemus\n\n\n\nHe\u2019d send it to the Potters first thing. It hadn\u2019t solved the Sirius problem, though. Remus had such a strong sense that he needed to do\n\n\nsomething\n\n\n- a gesture. Not romantic exactly, but\u2026 dramatic. He wanted to do something by himself, something that would make Sirius proud of him. This wasn\u2019t a secret, Remus told himself; not in the usual sense. It was a surprise. A present. But\n\n\nwhat\n\n\n?!\n\n\nJust as Remus was getting up to leave the hall, Emmeline Vance wafted past in a haze of sweet perfume and blonde hair. Something clicked in Remus\u2019s brain and he jogged to catch her up,\n\n\n\u201cHey! Hey, Emmeline! Can I ask you a favour\u2026?\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nFriday 7th October 1977\n\n\nIt had taken all week between lessons and homework, but Remus had finally cracked it in time for Friday morning. It was a bit mad - which was why he hadn\u2019t told anyone about it. They might think it was a bit strange, going so far over the top just to cheer Sirius up. But it just seemed so worthwhile at the time; making Sirius happy.\n\n\nEmmeline\u2019s instructions had been relatively clear, but Remus had made some of his own tweaks for good measure. He had paid her off with the last of his tobacco and sworn her to secrecy, though she\u2019d said she wouldn\u2019t tell anyway because she liked the idea so much - she loved Marc Bolan too. The next few days he spent doing preliminary work in the library, hidden at his favourite desk near one of the back windows, where the light was good.\n\n\nFriday morning, he woke early - earlier than James, even - borrowed the invisibility cloak and made sure everything was in place. He made a mental note to get better at setting timing spells as he yawned his way through the halls, tapping each portrait, statue and suit of armour with his wand.\n\n\nBy the time everyone else was beginning to wake up, Remus had finished, and was snoozing in an armchair in the common room.\n\n\n\u201cMorning, Moony!\u201d James woke him cheerily, in full quidditch kit, broom in hand.\n\n\n\u201cMm morning\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSee you in Charms!\u201d He called as he exited through the portrait hole. Remus sat up straight and listened intently.\n\n\nQuiet\u2026 footsteps\u2026 James whistling\u2026 then\u2026 yes! The fat lady began to sing in a high falsetto;\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nRide it on out like a bird in the sky ways\n\n\n\n\nRide it on out like you were a bird\n\n\n\n\nFly it all out like an eagle in a sunbeam\n\n\n\n\nRide it on out like you were a bird\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d James exclaimed.\n\n\nRemus grinned and punched the air. It worked.\n\n\nThe rest of the morning was delightful chaos. Every portrait in the castle had begun to sing \u2018Ride a White Swan\u2019, on repeat - and not just the portraits. Every radio, gramophone, record player, statue - anything that could make a noise was now tunefully blaring Marc Bolan\u2019s greatest hit.\n\n\nThe best part was that most of the muggle born students were singing along too, as it was such a catchy song.\n\n\nThe racket was so bad in the end, that McGonagall announced lessons would be cancelled for the day while the teachers worked out how to stop the singing - Remus had added a security measure which meant that \u2018Silencio\u2019 only resulted in a volume increase.\n\n\nSirius was thrilled, of course.\n\n\n\u201cWho\u2019d you think did it?\u201d Peter asked, excitedly at the breakfast table.\n\n\nIn the background some sixth year girls were chanting along with the tinny baritone of the armour;\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nWear a tall hat like a druid in the old days\n\n\n\n\nWear a tall hat and a tattooed gown\n\n\n\n\nRide a white swan like the people of the Beltane\n\n\n\n\nWear your hair long, babe you can't go wrong...\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to\n\n\nthink\n\n\n, I\n\n\nknow\n\n\n.\u201d Sirius said, smugly.\n\n\nRemus smiled. Mary leaned over eagerly,\n\n\n\u201cWho?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cProngs, obviously!\u201d Sirius said, \u201cProbably trying to make it up to me, about the party.\u201d\n\n\nRemus\u2019s stomach sank. The idiot.\n\n\n\u201cBlimey,\u201d Mary said, \u201cJames? By himself?\u201d She looked skeptical. Good old Mary.\n\n\n\u201cAmazing, right?\u201d Sirius kept saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t even think Prongs\n\n\nknew\n\n\nany T-Rex songs!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d Remus said, irritably, \u201cFunny thing, that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d Mary nudged him, \u201cI thought you liked T-rex!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI do.\u201d Remus replied, tight lipped. He stood up. \u201cIf lessons are cancelled, I s\u2019pose I\u2019ll go and catch up on some homework.\u201d\n\n\nSirius looked up, confused.\n\n\n\u201cI thought we were going to - er - play chess?\u201d Remus shrugged,\n\n\n\u201cNot in the mood.\u201d He left quickly, before his annoyance became too obvious.\n\n\nHe did go to the library, of course (it was the only quiet place in the castle) but he couldn\u2019t concentrate on anything - plus, someone had dared to sit in his favourite seat. They were only two second years, and Gryffindors too - if he wanted to play the marauder card he could easily get them to move. But he was in the mood to suffer in silence, so he picked a lesser desk.\n\n\nSomeone had carved something into the wood - who knew how long ago, everything in this damn castle was so old. It was a poem - a few lines of adolescent doggerel.\n\n\n\nNever kiss your lover at the garden gate\n\n\n\n\nLove is blind - but your neighbours ain\u2019t!\n\n\n\nRemus snorted, despite himself. Stupid. Didn\u2019t even rhyme properly.\n\n\n\u201cAlright,\n\n\nMoody\n\n\n?\u201d\n\n\nRemus looked up to see Sirius sauntering towards him, weaving smoothly between the big study desks. A group of girls sitting behind Remus tittered noisily. Remus slouched down further in his seat, folding his arms.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d He grunted, flipping open the nearest book to a random page.\n\n\n\u201cMm, you look it.\u201d Sirius grabbed a chair, spun it around and straddled it, folding his arms along the back and rested his chin on them, staring at Remus in that annoying way, with that annoying grin.\n\n\n\u201cGo away.\u201d Remus said, looking at his book.\n\n\n\u201cMoony.\u201d Sirius smiled, \u201cIt was you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\nRemus shrugged. Sirius snorted, \u201cYou twat, why didn\u2019t you just\n\n\nsay\n\n\nso?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t feel like it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI dunno.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCould it be that you are completely mental, in addition to being a moody git?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBugger off.\u201d Remus was starting to smile. He hated that Sirius could always do that. Sirius gave a little sigh.\n\n\n\u201cY\u2019know, Moony, if you insist on being so secretive all the time, misunderstandings\n\n\nwill happen\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Remus felt uncomfortable. He wasn\u2019t used to Sirius being the logical one. \u201cSorry.\u201d His shoulders sank and he looked down nervously. \u201cDo you like it, though?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf\n\n\ncourse\n\n\nI like it you idiot!\u201d Sirius exclaimed, slapping his hand in the desk. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible, Remus. Thank you. I...\u201d Sirius pinked slightly, \u201cI really love it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou do?\u201d Remus looked up at him.\n\n\n\u201cI do. I\u2019ve always loved your magic. It's so\u2026 you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up.\u201d Remus felt himself blushing. It was even harder not to smile, every muscle in his face was conspiring against him.\n\n\nHe kicked Sirius\u2019s foot under the table. Sirius kicked him back."

            "content": "Friday 4th November 1977 - 2:00 AM in Gryffindor Tower\n\u201cI think there\u2019s something to the colour changing idea.\u201d James slurred, using his goblet to gesture wildly. Thankfully, it was empty, and didn\u2019t spill.\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s too obvious,\u201d Sirius shook his head, just as drunk as James, but handling himself remarkably well, for once.\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Lily yawned, from where she sat on the floor, head nodding against James\u2019s knee. \u201cWhat do we change? Their robes?\u201d\n\u201cTheir whole dormitory!\u201d Mary suggested, the only one still dancing, winding her arms slowly over her head and rolling her hips to a sultry Nina Simone track. \u201cComplete makeover! Bright pink!\u201d\n\u201cWhy pink, though?\u201d Sirius said, \u201cSome people might like pink.\u201d\n\u201cHa, on your own, Black!\u201d Marlene pulled a face at him. She was sitting upside down in an armchair, her legs dangling over the back, long blonde hair touching the floor. Her eyes were fixed on Mary moving in front of the fireplace.\nThey were the last few standing after Sirius\u2019s eighteenth birthday party, which had been as uproarious and over the top as usual. The only non-seventh year remaining was Christopher, who looked like he was struggling to keep his eyes open, but held on valiantly, taking notes for the Slytherin prank which they were currently brainstorming.\n\u201cHow would we even get hold of their robes, though?\u201d Peter asked, fiddling with the label on his beer bottle, \u201cWe had the same problem in first year, remember? With the itching powder.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d James nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right - it was easier to sneak into their common room than it was to work out how the house elves organise the laundry\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHow\ndid\nyou sneak in?\u201d Marlene asked, frowning, \u201cYou can\u2019t have perfected an invisibility spell by the age of eleven\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAsk us no questions and we shall tell you no lies, McKinnon.\u201d Sirius winked at her. He was watching Mary dance too, his eyes shining with intoxication. \u201cAnyway, we\u2019ve decided not to do it.\u201d\n\u201cYou decided.\u201d James corrected.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my birthday!\u201d\n\u201cNot anymore, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Peter threw a cushion at him. Sirius threw one back, then James launched another, and soon enough they were all drunkenly flinging cushions back and forth, giggling dopily.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Marlene laughed, after deflecting a big round velvet one, \u201cI\u2019m off to bed.\u201d She placed her hands on the carpet and flipped forward neatly. She brushed her jeans as she \u00a0got up, a bit wobbly on her feet, then headed for the girls\u2019 dorm.\n\u201cNoo,\u201d Mary grabbed her around the waist, \u201cDon\u2019t go, Marls, dance with meee!\u201d\nMarlene laughed lightly, but Remus caught an odd flash of annoyance in Marlene\u2019s usually placid face as she gently unwound herself from Mary and backed away.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure one of the boys will oblige.\u201d She said, shortly, \u201cNight, all!\u201d\n\u201cNight!\u201d They chorused back. Remus vaguely wondered what was going on between the two best friends, but he was too drunk and sleepy to dwell on it very long.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll go up, too.\u201d Christopher was already on his feet, as though he had been waiting for someone else to admit defeat so that he wasn\u2019t the first. \u201cDon\u2019t decide anything without me, though!\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to formulate a plan tonight.\u201d Lily yawned again. \u201cSee you tomorrow, Chris.\u201d\n\u201cNight.\u201d The younger boy waved at all of them in his awkward, cheery way.\n\u201cIf no one wants to dance with me,\u201d Mary sighed, moving to turn off the record player, \u201cI s\u2019pose I\u2019d better get in some beauty sleep too.\u201d\n\u201cAnd me,\u201d Peter got up, tossing back the dregs of his drink.\n\u201cAnd me--\u201d Lily was getting up, when James pulled her into his lap, hugging her close.\n\u201cDon\u2019t go yet\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d She curled into him, sleepily, and they became one unit, cocooned in the big leather armchair. Remus blinked at them blearily and marvelled once again that they had all teased James for years about his certainty that he and Lily were made for each other. Funny how things work out.\n\u201cAbsolutely obscene.\u201d Sirius tutted, pulling a face at the couple. \u201cWell, if that\u2019s the way this party\u2019s going, I\u2019ll follow Wormtail\u2019s example\u2026 coming, Moony?\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d Remus got up off the sofa they had been sharing (maintaining a polite and inconspicuous distance, as they had done all evening).\nThey followed Peter up, and found he was locked in the bathroom, noisily brushing his teeth and gargling. Remus was exhausted, and sat on the end of his bed to wait, yawning and rubbing his eyes.\n\u201cGood birthday?\u201d He asked Sirius.\n\u201cBrilliant.\u201d Sirius grinned back.\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\u201c...If we wait until Pete\u2019s asleep--\u201d\n\u201cBad idea, Padfoot, especially if James isn\u2019t back yet. Anyway, I\u2019m knackered.\u201d He yawned again, as if to prove his point, \u201cAnother time.\u201d This was a bit of a white lie. After too many near misses, Remus had been trying to limit the amount of time he spent in Sirius\u2019s bed. It seemed so sneaky and dishonest.\n\u201cAnother time.\u201d Sirius sighed. \u201cJust\u2026 it\u2019s my birthday, and I\u2019ve barely seen you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here all day!\u201d This was true, of course - but it was true of all of the marauders, and Lily.\n\u201cYou\nknow\nwhat I mean.\u201d Sirius shook his head, impatiently.\nRemus did know, but he didn\u2019t have a response that would please Sirius. This same issue kept coming up, and, quite frankly, Remus was getting sick of it. Especially as there was no possible way to solve it until Sirius finally made his mind up. Tired, and getting more irritable by the second, Remus got up and began to change quickly into his pyjamas.\nSirius stood up and came over to him, crossing the beam of moonlight streaking the ancient floorboards. \u201cYou\u2019re not avoiding me, are you?\u201d He asked.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Remus muttered, \u201cI\u2019m just busy. I\u2019ve got a lot on.\u201d If he\u2019d said it once, he\u2019d said it a thousand times.\n\u201cOk.\u201d Sirius said, slowly. \u201cJust, y\u2019know. Lily and James are busy too, but they still seem to find time to--\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re\nnot\nLily and James, though, are we?!\u201d Remus raised his eyebrow.\nHonestly.\nSirius looked hurt.\n\u201cNo\u2026 but,\u201d\n\u201cThat was your decision.\u201d Remus said, buttoning his nightshirt. \u201cWhat was it you said? Not to \u2018scream it from the rooftops\u2019. I thought you wanted it this way.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Sirius looked lost.\nRemus rolled his eyes, exasperated.\n\u201cYou said you needed time. I\u2019m giving it to you. But you can\u2019t keep whinging about it.\u201d\nSirius withdrew. Remus knew he had won, but there was no joy in the victory.\nFortunately, Peter chose that moment to exit the bathroom. He made a beeline for his bed, head down, waving a lazy hand at them,\n\u201cNight, lads\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNight Pete!\u201d They both replied, cheerily.\n* * *\nSaturday 26th November 1977\nThey could get over little tiffs like that in those days - they could wake up the next morning and both be ready to wipe the slate clean. At least until the next time. In the end, their desire for each other, their affection - and most of all their friendship - seemed strong enough to win out over any other problems. It was a state of being that Remus would later learn they were taking very much for granted.\nOn top of this, there was a war on, which may have explained quite a bit. Everyone was slightly melodramatic, and nerves were raw all round. The headlines weren\u2019t helping:\n\nMINISTRY RAIDS THREE HOUSES IN SEARCH FOR FORBIDDEN ARTEFACTS\n\n\nTHIRD VAMPIRE ATTACK IN TWO WEEKS\n\n\nMINISTER JENKINS STEPS DOWN IN WAKE OF DISAPPEARANCES\n\n\nWEREWOLF REGISTRY \u2018DANGEROUSLY UNDER-MANAGED\u2019 MINISTRY INSIDERS REVEAL\n\nAnd that was only this week\u2019s papers. Something was going on with the Slytherins too - more than the usual classist nonsense. Over the summer - or perhaps before that - a new hierarchy seemed to have formed, creating obvious divisions in the most controversial Hogwarts house.\nRegulus Black had always carried a certain amount of clout, of course. The heir to the most noble, exclusive and wealthy pureblood family had been popular amongst his ambitious peer group since his very first day of school. In turn, he had surrounded himself with a faction of pureblood students who seemed to grow nastier by the year. Except for Barty Crouch Jr, perhaps, who had been incredibly nasty even as a little boy.\nNow in his sixth year, Regulus did nothing to dispel the rumours that he was not only a death eater, but in regular communication with Lord Voldemort himself. In fact, Regulus seemed to rather enjoy his increased powers, which (according to Christopher, who shared several classes with him) even some of the teachers were observing. He held himself differently. He walked with his back straight, his chin raised, a permanent smirk affixed to his pale face. Remus could hardly recognised the nervous, troubled boy that Sirius had once called \u2018Reggie\u2019.\nRegulus was not stupid. He had never once had a detention, in all his time at school, and was as bright as his older brother when it came to his lessons. Still, unpleasant things seemed to happen to everyone around him. A fourth year Hufflepuff who (rumour had it) knocked over an inkwell on Regulus\u2019s desk while he was studying in the library was found two days later locked in a broom cupboard in the dungeons, white as a sheet and completely mute. He had been sent home to recover and had not been seen since.\nThe Ravenclaw quidditch team practice overran by half an hour one afternoon due to a mix up with the rota - meaning that the Slytherin team\u2019s practice had to be pushed back to the following day. The next time the Ravenclaws met they had to cancel their practice altogether, as well as postpone an upcoming match with Gryffindor, because nobody was able to touch their brooms without receiving hundreds of tiny splinters, which could only be removed by Madam Pomfrey.\nAnd the words \u2018mudbloods get out!\u2019 had been magically carved into the chalkboard in the Muggle Studies classroom, so that the lessons had to be moved while the teachers investigated.\nOf course, no one ever questioned Regulus, and, as there were no witnesses to any of these crimes, nothing could be done. Everybody knew, though, everybody with any stake in the war. The increasing cruelty and prevalence of such attacks had thrown a shadow over the castle which every student felt now, if they hadn\u2019t in previous years.\nIt might have been the reason that so many people wanted to help the marauders plan their next prank. Though that also had a lot to do with Christopher.\n\u201cDid you tell everyone?!\u201d Remus sighed, exasperated, as a third year scuttled out of the study room, flushed and grinning after offering his services to the cause (\u2018I blow stuff up all the time in potions!\u2019 he had explained, without a trace of irony. Remus had assured him that James and Sirius would be thrilled to hear it.)\n\u201cI just mentioned it to a friend\u2026\u201d Christopher replied sheepishly. \u201cYou know, a lot of people have got it in for Slytherin, and it\u2019s always a good idea to get a wide range of experience\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe marauders do not outsource their pranks.\u201d Remus sniffed, haughtily as they made their way back towards the tower.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\noutsourcing\n,\u201d Christopher countered, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026. er\u2026 collaboration.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t collaborate, either!\u201d\n\u201cWhy not? Isn\u2019t that what we\u2019re supposed to be fighting for? Inclusion?\u201d\n\u201cInclusion, yes. Equality, yes. Prank Planning Co-operatives? No.\u201d\nChristopher snorted with laughter. Remus smiled. Christopher had an awkward, braying laugh, like a donkey. It was pretty glorious to witness.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Christopher wheezed, catching his breath and wiping his eyes, \u201cWhat are your Christmas plans? staying here again?\u201d\n\u201cMm, maybe\u2026 or going to the Potter\u2019s. All hangs on whether or not James is going to spend it with Lily\u2019s family.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Merlin, don\u2019t,\u201d Christopher pulled a face, \u201cI think I preferred it when they hated each other. Prefect meetings are\nso boring\nnow, they spend the whole time talking each other up. Enough to give you toothache.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s nice,\u201d Remus said. \u201cJames has been bonkers about Lily since second year, if he can finally tell her how amazing she is instead of telling us, then all the better.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I s\u2019pose you\u2019re right. We should all be so lucky.\u201d Christopher sighed.\nThey were quiet for a bit after that, just walking together. As they turned the next corner, Remus realised that they hadn\u2019t passed anyone in a while. Fair enough, it was a saturday, but it wasn\u2019t a Hogsmeade weekend, and the weather was too poor for anyone to be outside.\nFinally, a first year came hurrying towards them through an archway which led to the east wing. Her eyes were big and frightened, she looked up at the two older boys,\n\u201cOoh,\u201d she squeaked, \u201cDon\u2019t go down there, it\u2019s horrid!\u201d and ran past them, presumably back to her house.\nChris and Remus looked at each other. Chris licked his lips, then squared his shoulders slightly, setting his mouth.\n\u201cI\nam\na prefect\u2026 so I\u2019d better\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d Remus patted his shoulder. Christopher nodded, looking very relieved. Remus wished James was there - or Sirius.\nThey walked side by side through the archway, and found themselves enveloped in total darkness. It was the middle of the afternoon, and Remus knew there were usually windows on this corridor, and even at night it was never\nthis\ndark. Something was very wrong.\n\u201c\nLumos\n,\u201d they both whispered, lighting their wand tips and holding them up, casting beams of white light across the grey flagstones, the blood red tapestries, the glinting suits of armour. It seemed empty. Christopher took a brave step ahead of Remus, clearing his throat,\n\u201cHello? Is anyone here?\u201d He called.\nNo response, utter silence. Christopher turned around to look at Remus, squinting and raising an arm to his eyes against the brightness of Remus\u2019s wand light, \u201cPerhaps you ought to go for a teacher?\u201d\n\u201cCome back with me, then,\u201d Remus said.\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d\nThere was a noise. A nasty, crawling, slimey squelch, just ahead of Christopher. They both whipped around and aimed their lights at it, but found only an empty corner. Christopher\u2019s heart was pounding hard, he reeked of adrenaline and terror. \u201cThere\u2019s something in here\u2026\u201d he whispered, fearfully.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Remus said, \u201cLet\u2019s go and get help\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s over there\u2026\u201d Christopher walked forward again, and Remus lost sight of him and had to go by smell. This was particularly disconcerting - Remus had never met a darkness so black that he could not see through it.\n\u201cChris\u2026?\u201d He reached forward, casting his light about.\n\u201cI\u2019ve found it\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 no! Oh Merlin, no! No!\u201d Christopher began to scream, somewhere further up the hall.\nWithout thinking, Remus bolted forward, following the terrible wails,\n\u201cChris!\u201d\nHe almost tripped over him. Christopher was curled up on the floor, hands covering his head, rocking and sobbing. \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d Remus asked, trembling now, as Christopher pointed at it. Remus used his wand to follow his friend's shaking arm, finally throwing light on their tormentor. Remus almost screamed too.\nA corpse - a horrible, rotting, shambling corpse was stumbling towards them through the velvet blackness. \u00a0It slumped forward with a heavy stoop, reaching for Christopher. The eyes were intact, yellow and red \u2013 both vacant and ravenous. It still had most of its skin; a grotesque pallet of mottled grey and deep bruise purple. It moaned, a ghastly, rattling sound through crooked yellow teeth.\nRemus raised his wand, and stood in front of Chris. He was about to fire a knockback jinx at it - the only thing he could think of at short notice - when it fixed its hungry eyes on him. In a second, it vanished.\nRemus blinked, gasping, and suddenly the hallway was filled with a pale, milky light, as a full moon rose before him. The scream died in his throat, and he was gripped with horror - how was it possible?! The moon was not due for a week! He had to run, he had to get away from Christopher, but\u2026 wait a minute.\n\u201cI know what you are!\u201d Remus\u2019s terror turned to elation, as he raised his wand once more, and shouted out confidently; \u201c\nRiddikulus\n!\u201d\nThe moon began to expand and transform once more - this time into a huge white beach ball, which began to bounce and spring off the walls, before bursting into a cloud of soapy bubbles. Remus laughed, as loudly as he could under the circumstances, and the boggart retreated. He took his chance, and grabbed Christopher - still curled up, eyes closed tight - under the arm, dragging him back towards the archway as fast as he could.\nThey came out the other side gasping and blinking hard in the light. Christopher was gripping Remus\u2019s robes tightly, his breathing heavy, face ashen.\n\u201cFuck.\u201d Remus murmured, feeling pretty shaky himself.\n\u201cTh-th-that was a boggart!?\u201d Christopher stutted.\n\u201cYeah, yeah, it was\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen one before, have you?\u201d\nChris shook his head. Remus patted his hands, willing him to let go.\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s ok. It wasn\u2019t real, remember? C\u2019mon, we have to tell someone, before anyone else runs into it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d Chris said, getting some of his courage back, \u201cI\u2019ll go now\u2026 are you ok to wait here? In case someone comes?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Remus nodded, \u201cNo one\u2019s getting past me.\u201d He grinned, trying to make light of it, but Christopher was still too shaken. He nodded grimly, and set off, still gripping his wand.\nAlone, Remus reached into his deep robe pockets and pulled out the marauder\u2019s map. He\u2019d had it on him for a while now, out of concern that James might take a look one day and wonder which he and Sirius were sharing the bathroom so often. \u201cI solemnly swear that I am up to no good,\u201d he whispered, tapping the parchment.\nThe map immediately sprang to life, ink spreading like vines across the page. Remus held it up to his eyes and frantically searched for the corridor with the boggart. There it was, and there he was, \u2018Remus Lupin\u2019, clearly marked out at one end.\nHe followed the length of it with his finger, it was completely empty; apparently boggarts did not show up, not enough substance, maybe. He reached the end, there was a second archway on the other side, he remembered, covered by a tapestry. Three people were waiting there, quite still. Barty Crouch Jr, Garrick Mulciber and... Remus\u2019s stomach sank, though he was not all that surprised. Here it was; proof in black and white. Regulus Black."

            "content": "In a miserable twist of fate, the December 1977 full moon fell on Christmas Day. The marauders all agreed to stay at Hogwarts for the duration, with a plan to travel back to the Potter\u2019s on Boxing Day. Lily made them all promise that they would meet up as soon as possible in Diagon Alley,\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only place my parents will let me go by myself,\u201d she explained to Remus, \u201cI wanted to come to the Potters too, but they\u2019re protective and they haven\u2019t met James yet.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not invite James to yours?\u201d Remus suggested. Lily bit her lip and shrugged.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a bit tricky. Maybe for Easter break.\u201d\nIt was a cheerless Christmas, really. James was missing Lily, Peter obviously wished he was at home, not stuck at school, Sirius was anxious and jittery whenever he and Remus were in the same room with someone else, and Remus himself was grumpy and irritable, waiting for the moon to take hold.\nThey didn\u2019t do anything very Christmassy, either, other than go down for lunch with the other students who had stayed. They had promised Mrs Potter not to exchange gifts until they could all be together.\n\u201cI feel awful.\u201d Remus sighed, as he wound his scarf around his neck, ready to start heading towards the shack ahead of his friends. \u201cYou lot should be at home. I could have stayed by myself \u2013 or used your attic again, Prongs.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d James shook his head manfully, \u201cI know how bad it is for you, in the attic, tied down like that. The shack is the best place \u2013 at least we can all run about a bit.\u201d\nAnd he was right, of course. They all needed a good run, and in the morning, Remus woke up and looked at his friend\u2019s rosy, grinning faces, and knew they all felt much better for it.\nThey couldn\u2019t leave immediately, of course, Madam Pomfrey would not allow it. Remus was prescribed his usual morning of sleep, and he hoped that the other marauder\u2019s had taken the opportunity to do the same.\nWhen he woke up in the infirmary, Sirius was sitting in the chair next to him, grinning, two suitcases at his feet.\n\u201cReady when you are!\u201d He said, cheerfully, and Remus felt a pang of guilt again. Sirius needed to get home to the Potters\u2019 just as much as James did.\n\u201cHave you packed for me?\u201d Remus sat up, blinking, \u201cBlimey.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I haven\u2019t,\u201d Sirius snorted, \u201cProngs did. I made sure he got the book on your bedside table, though.\u201d\nRemus opened his mouth to speak, but Sirius raised a hand, \u201c\nAnd\nthe one under your pillow. Don\u2019t worry, Moony, nothing gets past me.\u201d\n\u201cCheers,\u201d Remus smiled. \u201cJust let me get dressed, then\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSure you\u2019ll be ok to floo?\u201d Sirius asked, as Remus swivelled out of the bed, his bare feet landing on the cold flagstones. He felt a bit weak and woozy, but no worse than usual. He nodded,\n\u201cYeah. Apparated after a full moon once, remember?\u201d\n\u201cOk. But you should say, if you don\u2019t feel up to it.\u201d\n\u201cI will. Pass my jeans, will you?\u201d\nSirius complied. Remus dressed, slowly, checking his body with every stretch and turn, making sure everything was working as it should be. He was starving hungry, but willing to wait for Mrs Potter\u2019s cooking. \u201cWhere are the others?\u201d Remus asked, bending now to tie his shoelaces.\n\u201cCommon room,\u201d Sirius replied. He held up his silver compact mirror, \u201cI\u2019m to let Prongs know when we\u2019re on our way to McGonagall\u2019s office, they\u2019ll meet us.\u201d\n\u201cGreat.\u201d Remus nodded. He stopped for a moment, dizzy again, and pretended to just be stretching.\n\u201cMoony?\u201d\n\u201cMmm...?\u201d Remus began his second shoe, concentrating very hard.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to tell Prongs, over Christmas.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d He straightened up so suddenly that he had to grab Sirius\u2019s arm to stop from wobbling over. His head swam, and he blinked a few times while equilibrium restored itself. \u201cTell\u2026 Prongs?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Sirius looked very pale, his eyes big, \u201cIf it\u2019s ok with you? I think I\u2019d better.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. Yeah. I mean. Wow. Why now?\u201d\nSirius shrugged,\n\u201cSomething\u2019s got to give. And I\u2019m mental about you.\u201d\nRemus\u2019s face grew hot and he looked away. He nudged Sirius\u2019s toe with his own,\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\n\u201cNever.\u201d Sirius poked his tongue out. \u201cSo it\u2019s ok?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Of course it is. Will you let me know\u2026 when?\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely. I want to pick the right time.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll go and get Pomfrey now, shall I?\u201d\n\u201cCheers.\u201d And with that, Sirius jumped up and disappeared behind the screen. Remus sat still for a few minutes, stunned. Well. People could always surprise you.\n* * *\nBoxing Day afternoon at the Potters was a welcome change of pace. Euphemia wanted to know all about Lily, and Fleamont wanted to know how the new Gryffindor quidditch line-up was working out. This led to a very long and involved argument between Peter, Sirius, James and his father, as they complained about the poor new chaser \u2013 something Eriksson \u2013 and fretted over whether or not this would be the end to Gryffindor\u2019s six year winning streak.\nIn the end, Remus and Euphemia abandoned them to this and went into the kitchen to help Gully with the washing up. Mrs Potter pulled up a seat for Remus by the sink, and said,\n\u201cYou just sit there, my love, and you can dry. Don\u2019t want you on your feet all evening, or you\u2019ll never get up tomorrow. And it sounds like the boys have a lot planned.\u201d\nThey worked away in companionable silence for a while, Remus practiced several drying spells before giving up and just using a dishcloth. Maybe he would never be any good at domestic incantations.\n\u201cComes with practice,\u201d Euphemia smiled. Her face was soft in the twinkle of the fairy lights, and though she looked tired, and older than Remus had remembered her, she looked content and homely. Just as a mother should look, in his mind.\n\u201cMrs Potter?\u201d\n\u201cYes dear?\u201d\n\u201cYou knew my dad, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cLyall? A little bit, but not well. Monty knew him better, they crossed paths at the Ministry once or twice\u2026 and I believe they were both partial to a few Friday night pints in the Leaky Cauldron,\u201d she clucked her tongue indulgently.\n\u201cWhat about Hope?\u201d\nEuphemia set down the plate she had been about to hand over, and looked down at him. He swallowed, \u201cHope Lupin? My mother. She was a muggle.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I know, dear. I only met her once.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\nmet\nher.\u201d He stared at James\u2019s mother, amazed. Why had it never occurred to him before? She pulled off her bright yellow marigolds and sat down in the chair beside him.\n\u201cWe were only introduced. We were both pregnant, at the time, that\u2019s the only reason I remember. She was a lot younger than me, and \u2013 as you say \u2013 a muggle. We moved in different circles, I suppose. Lyall was a very private man.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was she like?!\u201d Remus asked, desperately, \u201cWas she\u2026 nice?\u201d\n\u201cOh, Remus,\u201d Euphemia reached over and took his hand, which was cold from the dishes, and felt a bit too familiar. He didn\u2019t want to upset her, though, so he let her do it. \u201cShe was\nvery\nnice, from what I remember. Mousey little thing, blonde hair, and a lovely smile. Very small, I remember thinking \u2013 though next to Lyall, anyone looked small. I don\u2019t remember what the occasion was, but we were both enormous \u2013 I remember her telling me she was expecting in March. I told her to get in touch if she needed anything, but I\u2019m afraid she never did. Perhaps she didn\u2019t know how to do it.\u201d\nRemus looked down. If he had made it through his childhood unscathed, perhaps in time his mother might have made more friends. Perhaps she would have befriended Mrs Potter, and perhaps they would all have spent Christmases together.\n\u201cI was given a letter,\u201d Remus said, slowly. \u201cWhen I turned seventeen. She wrote it \u2013 Hope \u2013 before giving me away. She said in it\u2026 she said I might try to find her.\u201d\n\u201cIs that what you\u2019d like?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe she\u2019s changed her mind by now.\u201d\n\u201cRemus.\u201d Euphemia said, very fiercely, \u201cI can promise you she hasn\u2019t. If you want to look for your mother, then just give me the word. Monty can do it in a trice.\u201d\nRemus looked up, finally, and smiled.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nHe went to bed early, and was woken by Sirius, creeping in under the covers. The house had grown quiet, and it was very dark out.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Sirius whispered, smelling faintly of brandy, and warm all over as he wound his arms around Remus, \u201cDi\u2019n\u2019t mean to wake you up.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you did.\u201d Remus murmured, sleepily. \u201cHaven\u2019t told Prongs yet, then?\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d Sirius shook his head against Remus\u2019s arm, burying his face under the duvet, \u201cI thought tomorrow. After Diagon Alley, before dinner.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d Remus sighed, closing his eyes and settling back to sleep. Just before he drifted off, he whispered, \u201cYou better set an alarm of something, then, so you can get back to your own bed, before\u2026\u201d But no. Sirius had fallen sound asleep.\n* * *\nTuesday 27\nth\nDecember 1977\n\u201cCOME ON, COME ON! HURRY UP!\u201d James was bellowing up the stairs as Remus searched for his woolly hat.\n\u201cCalm down you lunatic, we\u2019re almost ready!\u201d Sirius yelled back, from the landing, where he was re-arranging his parting in the full length mirror.\n\u201cNo shouting in the house, boys!\u201d Euphemia called from the kitchen.\n\u201cI can\u2019t find it. Did you pack it?\u201d Remus huffed, hanging off his door frame.\n\u201cI told you, I left packing to Prongs. OI, PRONGS! YOU FORGOT MOONY\u2019S HAT YOU BASTARD!\u201d\n\u201cI ASKED YOU TO HELP ME!\u201d James shouted back, \u201cYOU SAID I HAD EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL!\u201d\n\u201cI ASSUMED YOU DID!\u201d\n\u201cSORRY, MOONY!\u201d\n\u201cIT\u2019S OK, PRONGS!\u201d Remus joined in, a bit embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019ll go without.\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that cold.\u201d\n\u201cHave mine,\u201d Sirius shrugged, tossing his head again, still eyeing himself in the mirror, \u201cI don\u2019t want to muck up my hair, anyway, \u201c\nAccio\nhat.\u201d\nSirius\u2019s red woollen hat, emblazoned with a Gryffindor lion came shooting out of the rubbish tip he called a bedroom, and Remus grabbed it from the air and rammed it down on his head.\n\u201cOk. Let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\u201cFinally!\u201d James met them at the bottom of the stairs, where he had been waiting for a good half an hour now.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Wormtail?\u201d\n\u201cSent an owl, doesn\u2019t feel like it, apparently. Grumpy git.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well for once I don\u2019t blame him for not wanting to floo to London on a winter\u2019s day just to see you and Evans snog.\u201d Sirius teased.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not\nall\nwe do!\u201d James\u2019s ears turned red. \u201cAnyway, if that\u2019s true, why are you and Moony coming?\u201d\n\u201cI want some new books and he\u2019s a voyeur.\u201d Remus shrugged. \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go, shall we?\u201d\nRemus remembered to keep his eyes and mouth closed this time, and liked to think that he arrived in the fireplace of The Leaky Cauldron with some dignity, even if he\nhad\ntripped over the cast iron grate. Luckily, he stumbled straight into Lily\u2019s arms, as she had been anxiously awaiting their arrival.\n\u201cOof!\u201d She yelped, staggering but just about keeping upright. \u201cHiya, Remus!\u201d\n\u201cHi,\u201d he laughed, getting his own balance, \u201cMy hero!\u201d\n\u201cToo late, Prongs,\u201d Sirius said, brushing himself off, as he stepped neatly over the grate, \u201cYou\u2019ve lost her to a better man already.\u201d\n\u201cIt was inevitable, I suppose.\u201d James grinned, following him out. Lily let go of Remus immediately and flung herself at James, who looked thrilled to bits.\nThey managed to find a table to sit at in the crowded pub, and ordered four butterbeers.\n\u201cBusy, isn\u2019t it!\u201d Remus said, raising his voice over the din as he pushed through the throngs of shoppers with the drinks.\n\u201cSales,\u201d Lily said, casually, \u201cOxford Street\u2019s just as bad, I was there with Mum this morning.\u201d\n\u201cAnyone here we know?\u201d Sirius asked, raising his head to look about at the faces,\n\u201cUm\u2026 not really\u2026 Ooh, er, I did see Frank, earlier \u2013 do you remember Frank Longbottom? He was Head Boy in our first year.\u201d Lily said, before ducking her head and focusing on her drink \u2013 and James\u2019s hand, which was on her hip and snaking slowly underneath her green wool jumper.\nOnce they had finished their drinks, they were all keen to get out of the noisy, overwarm pub and into the fresh air. The street, however, was just as packed. It seemed to Remus that the entire wizard population of Britain must be crammed into these few crooked streets, all wrapped up in heavy winter robes, carrying bags and baskets and boxes, cheerily wishing each other merry Christmas or else rudely barging through the hustle and bustle to get to the shop they wanted.\n\u201cTry to stay together!\u201d James threw over his shoulder at Sirius and Remus, before promptly disappearing into the throng with Lily.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just do our shopping and find them later,\u201d Sirius huffed, put out. \u201cDid you say you wanted books?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus nodded, distracted. \u201cCan you smell that?\u201d\n\u201cSmell what?\u201d Sirius asked, pulling Remus\u2019s robe in the direction of Flourish & Blott\u2019s. Remus followed, but sniffed the air again. The trouble was, it was so hard to describe a scent \u2013 even to Sirius, whose own canine attributes sometimes surfaced even when he was in human form.\n\u201cI dunno.\u201d He said, lamely, \u201cJust smells different than last time. The magic. It\u2019s probably just all these people.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\nsmell\nmagic?!\u201d\n\u201cOh. Yeah, I can.\u201d\n\u201cBloody hell.\u201d\nThe bookshop was manic, but Remus didn\u2019t mind. He would have been content to wander the shelves all day, row by row, picking through and reading blurbs and stroking covers. He was having the best afternoon he\u2019d had in ages, until he was interrupted.\n\u201cWell, well. Look who it is.\u201d Remus looked up, and saw Snape standing only a few meters away. He reeked of sliver, so Remus stayed back.\n\u201cWhat do you want, Snivellus?\u201d He tutted, pretending to be unconcerned, returning to the book he was looking at.\n\u201cYou and your little band of delinquents might think you own the school,\nLoony Lupin\n,\u201d Severus tutted, \u201cBut you do not have any claim on Diagon Alley. I\u2019m allowed to shop wherever I like.\u201d\n\u201cWell. Piss off and shop, then.\u201d Remus shrugged, turning away. He was starting to feel sick, and he wanted Snape and whatever he was hiding under his robes\ngone\n.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in my way.\u201d Snape narrowed his cold black eyes. He began to advance on Remus, reaching over his shoulder for a book on potions. Remus\u2019s hands began to shake, so he put his book down and moved away, shoving his hands inside his pockets. Where was Sirius?\n\u201cFeeling all right, Loony?\u201d Snape smiled maliciously.\n\u201cWhat are you\ndoing\nwith that much silver on you, you freak?\u201d Remus choked, leaning back on the bookcase behind him, his eyes watering.\n\u201cOne can\u2019t be too careful.\u201d Snape purred. \u201cYou get all sorts, \u2018round here.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, Snivellus?\u201d Sirius\u2019s voice came from just behind them. Remus sighed with relief as Snape reeled back, looking as though he\u2019d been caught stealing. Sirius stepped out from behind the bookcase, arms folded, \u201cGet lost on the way to Knockturn Alley, did you? Or maybe just in town for your annual hair wash?\u201d\n\u201cFuck off, Black.\u201d\n\u201cOh, please, after you,\u201d Sirius made a sweeping bow, allowing Severus to stalk off, mumbling darkly to himself. Remus chuckled, weakly.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou ok?\u201d\nHm. Better not to worry him, about the silver. Probably just Snape being his usual revolting self.\n\u201cFine.\u201d Remus smiled. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go and find the others, shall we?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to buy your books?\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d Remus shook his head, \u201cI just wanted to make a note of the names, see if Pince will order them into the school library for me. Free, that way.\u201d\n\u201cFair enough. C\u2019mon then, mad in here.\u201d\nThey had to push most of their way outside, and once they were out, Remus needed a breather, and had to lean against the wall in the alleyway beside the shop.\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ok?!\u201d Sirius asked, tugging at a lock of his long hair, anxiously.\n\u201cFine!\u201d Remus breathed, nodding again. The sickly feeling was receding, now, he just needed a minute. \u201cJust the moon, probably. Still tired.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did Snivellus want?\u201d\n\u201cOh, the usual nonsense,\u201d Remus screwed up his face, \u201cI don\u2019t think he meant to bump into me. What\u2019s Knockturn Alley?\u201d\n\u201cOver there,\u201d Sirius nodded across the street to another alleyway, slightly wider than the one they were standing in, which clearly led to more shops. \u201cIt\u2019s where the dodgier types hang out. Dark wizards, banshees in disguise, vampires. That sort of thing.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d And werewolves. Remus knew this instantly. There was a very faint scent, now he knew what to look for. Someone who had been there recently. Not Livia.\n\u201cJames\u2019s dad was telling me they\u2019re planning a raid on some of the shops down there in the New Year \u2013 reckon they\u2019re stocking illegal supplies. Bet you anything it\u2019s where Snivellus snuck off to.\u201d\nRemus stared at Knockturn Alley for a while, as he caught his breath. Whatever the strange new scent was, it was coming from there. He\u2019d smelled something like it before; from Moody. Dark Magic \u2013 burnt around the edges, charred flesh. He shivered.\n\u201cQuality Quidditch Supplies?\u201d He suggested, \u201cIf James is anywhere he\u2019ll be there,\u201d\n\u201cGood shout!\u201d Sirius nodded, \u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d\nThey left the shadowy alleyway, and stepped out into the bright winter sunshine. It hadn\u2019t snowed this year, but it was still bitterly cold, and the sky was clear, making the air fresh and crisp with energy. As they crossed the road, slowly past the gaggles of witches shopping with their children, the wizards stopping to pass the time of day, and house elves running errands for their masters, the energy seemed to change, slightly. It made the hairs on Remus\u2019s stand up neck, like the arrival of a predator. He tensed, and looked around. He caught sight of Lily and James looking at the latest broom in the window of Quality Quidditch Supplies. He was about to turn and get Sirius\u2019s attention, when it happened.\nBANG\nThe front of The Leaky Cauldron exploded in a plume of thick, blood red smoke, bricks and wood and glass flying out into the street. There was barely a microsecond of stunned silence before the screams started, wails of pain and terror and shock. The chaos around them seemed to expand and contract, like a crashing wave.\nCRACK CRACK CRACK, people were apparating around them \u2013 many were leaving, but a few were arriving, too. These were the ones that made something deep inside Remus want to start growling.\nBANG\nAnother shop, further up the street exploded too, then another, and\u2026\n\u201cGet down!\u201d Sirius full-body tackled Remus to the ground, and they both covered their faces as Quality Quidditch Supplies went up in smoke."

            "content": "The ground shook, and Remus squeezed his eyes shut, belly down on the cobblestones. Everything after that moment \u2013 seeing Lily and James\u2019s heads turn, before the building in front of them exploded \u2013 everything after that made so little sense. It was all too slow, or too fast, and Remus found he did not react in his usual way \u2013 he was weak, frightened, his comprehension muddled. He felt stunned.\nThey raised their heads \u2013 he and Sirius \u2013 much too long after it had gone quiet, when people around them were already standing up, and were shouting, or crying. Someone was definitely crying, a woman. That seemed loudest of all. And someone laughing, too, a thin, razor sharp cackle in the distance, pure joy.\nDiagon Alley looked like a bomb site. The shops which had been destroyed were like broken teeth in a gaping maw; strange blue patches of sky where something else should be. It was hard to see much on ground level, but they squinted through the settling dust further down the street towards Gringotts, where most of the noise seemed to be coming from,\n\u201cYou two!\u201d A woman hissed, coming towards them from behind, picking through the rubble, her wand raised, \u201cGet back! Behind me!\u201d She stalked ahead. Her robes were deep maroon, an auror\u2019s uniform.\n\u201cJames!\u201d Sirius choked, his voice strange and strangled with terror. He scrambled to his feet, his robes all dusty and his hair full of soot. He half ran, half stumbled, towards the hole in the sky where the quidditch supply shop had stood, minutes before.\n\u201cSirius no\u2026\u201d Remus coughed, weakly, following him, feeling stupid and heavy.\n\u201cJames!?\u201d Sirius was shouting, but so many people were shouting.\n\u201cSirius!\u201d Remus coughed again, trying hard to keep up, but he\u2019d bruised his hip when he\u2019d hit the ground, and his ears were still ringing, and his eyes were starting to go blurry as he wiped away tears with dusty wrists. \u201cSirius\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMUDBLOODS OUT!\u201d\nRemus dropped to his knees, covering his ears, and he was not the only one. The voice seemed to be right behind him \u2013 inside his head, it was everywhere. The crowd was silent, finally, as everyone stared around, blinking, looking for the owner of the horrible, insidious voice.\nWhatever was going on, it was happening further away \u2013 Remus could smell magic now, and see beams of light firing through the dust cloud surrounding Gringotts. He could smell Moody, and\u2026 Ferox? Maybe him. And the death eaters. Some of them he recognised, others he didn\u2019t \u2013 but they were there, and there were a lot of them. Where was Sirius? The ruins of the shop which had stood before them was still bleeding smoke, and Sirius had wandered straight into it, the idiot.\nGritting his teeth, and with not a little pain, Remus pushed himself to his feet again. He had to find them.\nThe shouts of battle were getting louder, more desperate; the woman who had ordered him and Sirius back had joined in, and Remus\u2019s conscience told him he ought to go and help. But James, and Lily, and Sirius\u2026\n\u201c\nMorsmorde\n!\u201d The same voice spoke, close and far away.\nThe smoke filling the street seemed to writhe and darken, expanding and swirling upwards to form an enormous snake entwined with a screaming, hollow eyed black skull.\n\u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201d A man near Remus shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s you know who!\u201d\n\u201c\nSilencio\n!\u201d Someone else hexed him into quiet. An odd stillness, more flashes \u2013 blue, green, yellow, red, and then\u2026\nCRACK CRACK CRACK, they were getting away!\nFor the first time, Remus thought to withdraw his wand, fumbling about in his borrowed robes for it. As he did, his fingers brushed against something else \u2013 smooth and heavy. His fingers closed around his pocket watch and he wrenched it out, prising it open quickly and saying aloud,\n\u201cSirius Black.\u201d\nThe needle did not even wobble, but pointed forward immediately, and Remus followed it towards the ruin of the shop. \u201cSirius?! Sirius?!\u201d\n\u201cMoony!\u201d A hand grabbed his shoulder and he whipped around desperately.\n\u201cJames!\u201d\nJames hugged him, fiercely, and Remus didn\u2019t even think about how unusual it was, he was just so, so grateful, and relieved, he hugged him back. Lily appeared at his shoulder, pale faced, her hair falling out of its ponytail, clothes smudged with ash. There was a cut just under her hairline, dark blood oozing down into her left eyebrow. And Sirius, too,\nthank god thank god thank god\n.\n\u201cI lost you.\u201d Remus said, hoarsely, once James let him go. One of the lenses in his glasses was shattered.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Sirius said, sounding just as awful.\n\u201cWe\u2019d better go and help,\u201d James said, shaking both their shoulders, \u201cThe battle\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFinished.\u201d Remus said. \u201cThey ran away. Disapparated, most of them. How did you two\u2026\u201d he stared at Lily and James, still not quite believing his eyes.\n\u201cFrank.\u201d Lily said, sounding much smaller than Remus had ever heard her. James wrapped an arm around her. \u201cFrank\u2019s an auror. He used a knock-back jinx on us, right before the shop was hit, then\nprotego\n, I think. I didn\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Her eyes filled with tears, and James wrapped his other arm around her, enveloping her completely.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t, either.\u201d Remus said, as if it would help. \u201cDidn\u2019t even get my wand out.\u201d\nSirius was gripping his, though. He looked dreadful; fierce as a demon, eyes full of hatred,\n\u201cI\u2019m going anyway. They might still need help.\u201d He said.\nRemus grabbed him by the shoulders, surprising even himself with his strength.\n\u201cDon\u2019t. You. Dare.\u201d He growled, meeting Sirius\u2019s eye. Something distinctly canine passed between them, then, and Remus almost thought they were going to actually fight, and that it would be sort of a relief if they did. But of course, James intervened.\n\u201cMoony\u2019s right,\u201d he said, \u201cWe ought to\u2014\u201d\nCRACK\n\u201cBoys!\u201d\n\u201cDad!\u201d\nFleamont Potter had arrived right next to James. He grabbed his son, then Sirius, then Remus \u2013 who had recovered enough now to find the hugging all a bit much \u2013 and then stared with horror at what remained of Diagon Alley. His bushy eyebrows knit, and he addressed his son,\n\u201cAre you all ok? Your mother wants you back at the house immediately, she\u2019s been called to St. Mungo\u2019s, otherwise she\u2019d be here.\u201d\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we stay and help?\u201d James asked, looking troubled, still holding Lily tightly to his chest.\nWhat a bloody hero\n, Remus thought. He still had Sirius by the shoulders, gripping him hard because he couldn\u2019t hug him.\nFleamont looked at James and seemed to grow a few inches with pride. He smiled,\n\u201cNo, son, it\u2019s all in hand \u2013 Moody\u2019s there, and Dumbledore\u2019s on his way. I just want you all home and safe, before anything\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo one is to leave!\u201d A man was shouting, cutting through the crowd and the rubble with an authoritative stride. \u201cNot until they have been questioned by\u2014oh, hello Monty. Didn\u2019t know you were here.\u201d\n\u201cAmos,\u201d Mr Potter nodded at the ministry official. \u201cGot here as soon as I could. Taking the boys home, they were out shopping and got caught up.\u201d\n\u201cThat so?\u201d The official \u2013 Amos \u2013 came over to look at them all. \u201cNames?\u201d\n\u201cAmos, is that really necc\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNames?\u201d He repeated, in a harder tone.\n\u201cWell you\nknow\nJames, you\u2019ve known him since he was five, for goodness sake\u2026\u201d Fleamont tutted, \u201cAnd this is Miss Evans, I presume?\u201d He glanced at Lily, who had stopped crying, but still looked very frightened.\n\u201cYes.\u201d She squeaked. \u201cLily Evans.\u201d\n\u201cEvans?\u201d Amos looked thoughtful. He pulled some parchment out of his pocket, \u201cEvans, Evans\u2026 Parents names?\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know them.\u201d She said, her eyes darting between James and the official, \u201cI\u2019m muggleborn.\u201d\nAmos looked down his nose at her again, then eyed James with a rude quirk of his eyebrow.\n\u201cI see. Very well. And you two? Oh hoho! I know\nyou\n! You\u2019re the Black heir!\u201d\n\u201cWas.\u201d Sirius muttered. He shook himself free of Remus and shoved his hands in his pockets, adopting a sullen, irritable attitude which always appeared when his family was mentioned. Remus wished he could tell him not to do that. It didn\u2019t make him look any less guilty.\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming home with us, too.\u201d Fleamont said, quickly. \u201cSirius has lived with us for well over a year now, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCome come, Monty,\u201d Amos tutted, \u201cThe Black heir? I\u2019m not stupid, and neither are you. He\u2019ll have to be questioned.\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Fleamont raised his voice. Remus had never heard him shout before \u2013 it was even more terrifying than a dark mark. \u201cThey\u2019re school kids, for godric\u2019s sake!\u201d\n\u201cPlenty of school kids on\ntheir side\ntoo, from what I hear.\u201d Amos said, \u201cPlenty of Black\u2019s, too.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in that. You can speak with Dumbledore if you have to, but I am responsible for these boys and I am taking them all home right now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Amos suddenly turned on Remus, who blinked. Sometimes he forgot that the Potters included him in their responsibilities.\n\u201cR-Remus.\u201d He said, trying to be brave, but failing miserably\n. What if this man knows something? What if he knows I\u2019m a werewolf?\n\u201cLupin.\u201d\n\u201cHmph.\u201d Amos made a note, but asked no further questions. \u201cYou\u2019re all to wait here while I speak with Dumbledore.\u201d He said, pompously.\n\u201cLike hell we will.\u201d Fleamont snorted, \u201cIf you want to go and interrupt Albus Dumbledore while he assists in the investigation of a terrorist attack for the sake of a few frightened teenagers, then\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAmos!\u201d Someone \u2013 was it really\nFrank?\n\u2013 shouted from the distance, \u201cWhere the hell are you, we need you up here \u2013 it\u2019s Leo!\u201d\nThe official turned, sharply, and with a reluctant final glance at Sirius, he ran towards the voice. Mr Potter leapt into action, taking no chances,\n\u201cQuick, boys \u2013 are you all ok to apparate? Miss Evans, probably best you come with us for now?\u201d\nLily nodded, and James kissed her, before they both disapparated together, hand in hand. Fleamont nodded at Sirius and Remus, before vanishing with a loud CRACK himself. Remus looked at Sirius. Sirius looked at him too, still angry, still full of a hot desire for revenge.\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Remus said, firmly, then, barely even thinking about it, grabbed Sirius\u2019s elbow, hard, and prepared to apparate with him.\nSirius fought it, mid-turn \u2013 the stupid fool could easily have splinched them, as he strained against Remus\u2019s spell, wanting only to stay where the fight was. But Remus was stronger \u2013 the air was full of fizzing, roaring leftover magic, and Remus drank from it, overpowering Sirius with the sheer weight of his own determination.\nThey arrived on the Potter\u2019s front porch with such force their heads banged together, and they wrenched apart, panting, feeling scorched.\n\u201cFucking hell, Moony!\u201d Sirius gasped, rubbing his elbow where Remus had grabbed him.\n\u201cHad to\u2026 stop you\u2026 idiot\u2026\u201d Remus bent forward, hands on his knees. He felt completely drained, but buzzing with it; nerves alight with static.\nJames opened the door,\n\u201cGet inside,\u201d he said, \u201cQuickly.\u201d\nSirius pushed past Remus without looking at him.\nLily stayed for another hour or so, drinking cup after cup of tea, as Gully scuttled back and forth from the kitchen, wringing his little wizened hands and shaking his head woefully. Mr Potter apologised profusely to Lily, and hoped they would meet again soon under better circumstances \u2013 before locking himself away in his study. After that they sat in silence for most of the time; with only the occasional outburst from James or Sirius.\n\u201cSnape!\u201d Sirius ranted, pacing back and forth, \u201cWe saw him in the bookshop, he threatened Moony \u2013 he must have had something to do with it!\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d Lily said, shakily, staring at the pattern of her teacup.\n\u201cDid anyone see any of them, though?!\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d James shook his head. \u201cToo busy trying to take cover.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Lily shook her head.\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Remus said. Sirius looked up at him,\n\u201cMoony. You smelled something. You told me, remember? Do you know who\u2014\u201d\n\u201cRemus you can\nsmell\npeople?!\u201d Lily looked up, half shocked, half curious. \u201cLike a\nscent\n?\u201d\n\u201cNot like\u2026 it\u2019s just a\u2026 a wolf thing. Instinct. But I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Remus wished the ground would swallow him up.\nHe could tell them. But he didn\u2019t want to break it to Sirius like this; not while they were furious at each other, and frightened, and Lily and James were sitting right there.\n\u201cMoony.\u201d Sirius said, in a very low, dark voice that none of them had ever heard before. \u201cTell me. Who?\u201d\nRemus looked at James, desperately for help, but he was just staring back, waiting. Lily too, her mouth slightly open. He looked at Sirius again, and tried to hold his stare.\n\u201cI think Regulus was there. But\nlots\nof people where there Sirius\u2014\u201d\nSirius threw his hands up and left the room in utter silence. Lily gave a very tired sigh.\n\u201cJames,\u201d she said, \u201cI think I had better go home. Mum and Dad will wonder.\u201d\nJames insisted on apparating back with Lily, then returning by himself. Remus wished he hadn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t want to be left alone. Alone, it all came flooding back into his mind, as vivid as a cinema screen. The noise, the smoke, the utter terror. And shame. He had not acted. His first chance to prove to Dumbledore, and Moody, and even\nSnivellus\n, that he was on the right side, and willing to fight for it. But he had never expected it to be like that. Had never considered that when the time came, and you were on a battlefield with the only people you love in the world \u2013 all he\u2019d wanted to do was find them, and run away.\nWhen James returned, he found Remus pacing, treading the same stretch of carpet Sirius had been earlier.\n\u201cAre you ok, Moony?\u201d He asked, nervously, taking slow steps forward, arms up, as if Remus was an untamed beast.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Remus muttered, still pacing. \u201cI just\u2026 I couldn\u2019t move. I couldn\u2019t think.\u201d\n\u201cRemus\u2026\u201d James kept speaking in that steady, friendly tone. It was more soothing than Remus wanted to admit. \u201cNobody could. It was horrible; it\u2019s the scariest thing that ever happened.\u201d\nRemus stopped dead, and stared at James. He gave a half smile and shrugged, \u201cNone of us knew what to do.\u201d\n\u201cSirius did.\u201d Remus challenged. \u201cHe was the one who got up. He wanted to help\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSirius never\nthinks\nthough, Moony, you know that.\u201d\n\u201cOi, up yours, Potter.\u201d Sirius suddenly appeared in the doorway, arms folded. His eyes were a bit pink, but he didn\u2019t look angry any more. Remus smiled at him, hopefully, behind James\u2019s back. Sirius smiled back, reassuringly.\n\u201cI was\ngoing\nto say,\u201d James laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s what makes you so\nbrave\n, you wanker. You just want to rush in and help, even if it\u2019s the worst idea in the world.\u201d\n\u201cYes, ok, it was not a good idea.\u201d Sirius said, sitting down on the sofa, beside James.\n\u201cAt least you\ndid\nsomething.\u201d Remus said, \u201cAt least you\ngot up\n.\u201d\n\u201cYou got up, too, Remus.\u201d Sirius said, softly.\n\u201cAfter you did!\u201d Remus shot back, \u201cI was pathetic, I was\u2026 how are we ever going to win this war if it\u2019s going to be like that?! If I\u2019m too scared to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI was scared too.\u201d Sirius said, looking up. \u201cI\u2019m not\nthat\nbonkers. I was still bricking it, I mean. Fucking hell.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d James said, running his hand through his hair, still gritty with rubble. \u201cIt took me so long to even figure out what happened \u2013 and all I could think about was getting Lily somewhere safe. I thought I would just do anything to make sure she was safe.\u201d\n\u201cThere you are then.\u201d Sirius said, firmly. \u201cThat\u2019s how we win it.\u201d\n* * *\nMrs Potter did not come back from St Mungo\u2019s all night, but Fleamont stepped out of his office to tell the boys he had spoken to her, and that she was all right, before asking Gully to make him a sandwich and closing the door again.\nPeter came over, white and shaking \u2013 he had heard the news, apparently he had a cousin working for\nThe\n\nDaily\n\nProphet\n. There was no useful information though. No death count yet, it hadn\u2019t been finalised. Peter stayed for supper, but James was the only one really able to keep up a proper conversation, and eventually Peter left. When Remus announced he wanted an early night, the other two shrugged and agreed to go up too.\nAfter showering and washing the dust and smoke out of his hair, he brushed his teeth in the cold quiet bathroom and tried not to think about how odd it felt to be doing such normal things on such an abnormal day. He could hear Sirius and James murmuring quietly in the next room, solemn, tense tones. He decided to leave them to it.\nHours later, Remus was seriously regretting that decision. He couldn\u2019t sleep. He waited and waited for Sirius to come, until he realised that he must still be in with James, and might not come at all. Remus lay on his back and tried to keep his thoughts from getting too loud.\nThis is war,\nhe kept thinking.\nThis is what you agreed to do. You promised Dumbledore. You promised your friends.\nFinally, in the small hours, when he was sick from tiredness and the first pink rays of sunrise were peeking around the curtains, his door opened. Sirius crept across the room with the stealth of a cat.\n\u201cRemus?\u201d He whispered from the foot of the bed. Remus rolled over.\n\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\nSirius practically flew at him, sliding in under the covers and burying his head under the duvet. They clung to each other, and everything steadied itself. Remus felt was calm at last. In a moment, Sirius moved slightly and whispered,\n\u201cTell me a secret? A nice one?\u201d\nRemus paused. He kissed Sirius\u2019s hair.\n\u201cI\u2019m mental about you, too.\u201d"

            "content": "Monday 2\nnd\nJanuary 1978\nThe next week and a half was one of the darkest Remus could remember. When Mrs Potter finally arrived home the day after the attack, she was white and drawn, and hugged her family so tight, as if she had thought she would never see them again.\n\u201cAbout fifty dead, so I\u2019ve heard.\u201d She said, solemnly. \u201cI was mostly triage, though. Hundreds wounded.\u201d\n\u201cAny\u2026 any of us?\u201d Mr Potter asked. He looked as though he hadn\u2019t slept in hours \u2013 and indeed, as far as Remus knew, he had not been to bed either.\nEuphemia nodded, closing her eyes.\n\u201cLater.\u201d She said, casting a glance at the boys. James looked indignant.\n\u201cWe can hear it.\u201d He said. \u201cWe\u2019re all of age,\nand\nwe were there when it happened!\u201d\n\u201cYes, I know you were!\u201d Mrs Potter shouted, her voice shrill. James\u2019s mouth snapped shut and he looked down, ashamed. Mrs Potter got up. \u201cI\u2019m going for a lie down.\u201d\nShe left the room, and the men sat in silence.\n\u201cSorry, dad.\u201d James mumbled.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Fleamont removed his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose. \u201cWe\u2019re all upset. Your mother and I need you boys to listen, and do as you\u2019re told until it\u2019s time to go back to school, do you understand?\u201d\nThey all nodded, reluctantly, and Remus saw the muscles in Sirius\u2019s jaw tighten. It was a mark of his respect for Mr Potter that he did not protest. \u201cNow,\u201d Fleamont continued, \u201cThis house is going to be very busy for the next few days, and you\u2019re going to see a lot of very important people doing very important work. Do not ask too many questions, and do not make nuisances of yourselves.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t we help?\u201d James asked, earnestly.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Fleamont nodded. \u201cBy being gracious hosts and minding your mother.\u201d\n\u201cYes, dad.\u201d James sighed, looking down again, obviously disappointed.\n\u201cJames\u2026\u201d Fleamont began, reaching over to touch his son\u2019s arm.\nRemus and Sirius took that as their cue to clear the table, and waited around in the kitchen, half-heartedly helping Gully do the washing up.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what the fuss is about.\u201d Sirius grumbled, elbow deep in soap suds. \u201cIf they knew half of the things we were capable of \u2013 we can actually\nhelp\n.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have our chance.\u201d Remus replied, staring out of the window as he dried the plates. The garden was very dark, and a chill mist hung in the air, making it difficult to see much beyond the patio wall. He could just make out James\u2019s quidditch hoops on the lawn, and the dim waning moon. He didn\u2019t like not being able to see very far, it made him uneasy.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right for\nyou\nto say.\u201d Sirius was still complaining, \u201cYou\u2019ve already proved yourself.\u201d\n\u201dWhat?!\u201d Remus glanced up at him, confused, and momentarily distracted from the window.\n\u201cWith that werewolf you met, last year. You\u2019ve already faced the enemy and shown Dumbledore he can trust you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I explained that properly, if that\u2019s what you think\u2026\u201d Remus said. \u201cLivia wasn\u2019t\u2026 it wasn\u2019t about the war.\u201d\n\u201cDumbledore thinks it was. Moody does. They talk about the werewolves all the time \u2013 how useful you\u2019ll be trying to convince the dark creatures not to join\nyou know who\n.\u201d\n\u201cCan we talk about something else?\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d\nThey talked about nothing. They did the dishes in complete silence. Remus stared out of the window into the blackness of the Potter grounds and looked for\u2026 something.\nFinally, James came in, just as they finished putting away the last of the china.\n\u201cAll right, mate?\u201d Sirius asked, cheerily.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d James shrugged, looking somehow wiser; older. \u201cJust dad stuff, y\u2019know.\u201d\nSirius and Remus glanced at each other, and Remus knew they were both experiencing the same sour envy. What did it mean to have a father like Fleamont Potter? To have one at all?\n\u201cI said I\u2019d give Lily a ring, if you two fancied a walk into the village?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not.\u201d Sirius said, leaving the dish rag over the tap.\n\u201cOh, Moony, dad said to give you this?\u201d James handed over a small scroll of paper. Remus opened it quickly, glancing over the neat name and address written there. James cocked his head, curious,\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cOh nothing. Book I was asking about.\u201d Remus stuffed it in his pocket. \u201cC\u2019mon. Calls are cheaper after six.\u201d\nJames had finally learnt how to use the phone box unaided, so there was nothing for Remus to do but lean against the fence next to Sirius, waiting. He rolled cigarettes to pass the time; he\u2019d cut the fingers off his gloves back in November for explicitly this purpose.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean you.\u201d Sirius said, quietly. \u201cWhen I said dark creatures.\u201d\n\u201cI know you didn\u2019t.\u201d Remus licked the rizla then smoothed it down. He handed the completed cigarette to Sirius, who took it and put it behind his ear. Remus began another one.\n\u201cGot to teach me how to do that one day.\u201d Sirius murmured, watching him appreciatively. \u201cI bet we could work out a spell to do it instantly.\u201d\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Remus sighed, lining up tobacco. \u201cBut I like doing it this way.\u201d\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d\nThey were quiet again. Remus finished his second one and held it between his thumb and forefinger, wondering whether or not to smoke it. Mrs Potter didn\u2019t like the smell on them, and he hated to add to her troubles. But on the other hand, he could really use something to calm his nerves. Sirius could too, if the constant tapping of his leg was anything to go by. He was chewing his fingernails, too.\nRemus lit the cigarette with a snap of his fingers, and inhaled. Sirius followed suit. His leg stilled.\n\u201cI am, though.\u201d Remus said, on an exhale.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cA dark creature, like you said.\u201d\n\u201cMoony, no\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYep,\u201d Remus nodded, gazing out at the fields before them, and the motorway behind that. \u201cSo when you talk about wanting to prove yourself, I\ndo\nunderstand what you mean. People trust werewolves just about as much as they trust the disgraced sons of dark wizards.\u201d\n\u201cI do know. I didn\u2019t mean to act like\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLike you\u2019re the only one with a stake in this war?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, like that. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Remus smiled, looking at him, finally. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Regulus.\u201d\n\u201cWell.\u201d Sirius scuffed his feet in the gravel, \u201cI already knew, pretty much. Of course he was there.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to work so hard on this Slytherin prank when we get back to school. It\u2019ll be my best work.\u201d\nSirius laughed, an honest, abandoned noise, throwing his head back.\n\u201cGodric, Moony.\u201d He grinned broadly, \u201cWhen you say things like that it makes me want to snog your face off.\u201d\n\u201cHa,\u201d Remus snorted. He shot a look at James, inside the red phone box, jabbering away with a huge smile on his face, \u201cMaybe not\njust\nyet\u2026\u201d\nSirius looked mournful again,\n\u201cI\u2019m going to tell him, just not with all this bad stuff going on, you know?\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Remus nodded. He did. He didn\u2019t want Sirius to know it, but the idea of James finally finding out about them was much scarier than he had prepared himself for. Why shake everyone up again?\n\u201cRemus? If I ask you something, will you tell me the truth?\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d His stomach clenched involuntary, but he steeled himself.\n\u201cWhat was the note from James\u2019s dad? It wasn\u2019t a book title, was it?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus agreed, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d He reached inside his pocket and pulled it out, thumbing the soft, thick parchment for a moment before handing it over to Sirius.\nSirius unfolded it quickly and looked down.\n\u201cHope Jenkins?\u201d He read, a crease in his brow, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a name.\u201d Remus said, quickly, \u201cMy mother\u2019s name. And address.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Sirius breathed, re-reading it, still frowning. \u201cYour\nmother\n.\u201d He said the word as if he had never even considered the possibility that Remus had such a thing.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus took the parchment back, shoving it back into his pocket. \u201cI know we said we would talk about anything but mothers, but. Well. Dumbledore gave me a letter she\u2019d written me, back after Lyall died. She said I could try to find her, when I was of age, so\u2026 Mr Potter found her, I s\u2019pose.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with it? Write to her?\u201d\n\u201cYeah I think I will.\u201d\nSirius moved his hand on the fence, subtly brushing Remus\u2019s fingers.\n\u201cWell. I hope you find her.\u201d\n* * *\nMr Potter had been right \u2013 for the next few days, the house was busier than Remus had seen it since the Christmas party of \u201973. Except, of course, there was very little cheer. These were the people closest to Dumbledore \u2013 many of them were working for the ministry, but all of them were loyal to him before anything else. They were the front line in the war effort.\nSome of them were familiar faces \u2013 Moody, of course, who usually spared the time to cast a gruff nod at the three teenaged boys who were now spending their days watching the fireplace for new arrivals. Then there was Frank Longbottom himself, just as pleasant and good natured as Remus remembered. He came through most often with his girlfriend, Alice, the young woman who had ushered Sirius and Remus back on the day of the attack.\nThe Prewett twins were another surprise \u2013 James and Sirius were falling over themselves to catch up with them, and share every nefarious act they had committed at Hogwarts since the older boys\u2019 departure. They had both grown very handsome, broad shouldered and rougher round the edges from a few adventures \u2013 but they still had their same easy tempers and wicked sense of humour. Often they brought their red-haired sister, and her equally flame-haired husband.\nAll of these guests only stopped to chat a few moments to James, Remus and Sirius, before vanishing into Mr Potter\u2019s study, or else heading out into the garden to apparate (apparently Moody had placed a charm over the Potters\u2019 house making it not only unplottable, but impossible to place an apparition trace on). As a consequence, the living room and entrance hall began to feel very much like platform 9 \u00be.\nIn the evening\u2019s, Mrs Potter would come home, looking worn out and determined. She would still have a smile for everyone, and be ready to host whoever was in the house for supper. She was nothing sort of spectacular.\nThe night before the boys were expected to return to Hogwarts, Moody, Frank and Alice were joining them for dinner \u2013 beef stew with dumplings. They were having a very pleasant evening, Frank and Remus were having a very intense discussion about defensive charms, and Alice and the boys (including Fleamont) were arguing over which quidditch team was going to win the league.\nTo Remus\u2019s left, Moody leaned over to address Mrs Potter, and whispered,\n\u201cI hear Ferox is getting out, tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cGetting out?!\u201d Remus spun around, cutting frank off mid-flow, \u201cGetting out of where?\u201d\nMoody raised an eyebrow, making his eerie magical eye bulge grotesquely,\n\u201cBloody good hearing you\u2019ve got, lad. Make a good auror.\u201d\nRemus shook his head impatiently,\n\u201cProfessor Ferox?\u201d\n\u201cYes, dear,\u201d Euphemia explained, calmly, \u201cLeo Ferox was injured in the attack on Diagon Alley. He\u2019s now stable, and will be going to stay with his grandmother for a while to recuperate fully. I\u2019m sorry, I quite forgot he taught at Hogwarts, did you know him well?\u201d\n\u201cSort of. He was my favourite teacher,\u201d Remus said, his insides churning. \u201cIs he\u2026 what happened? Was he in one of the shops?\u201d\n\u201cHe was on the ground, in the battle with us,\u201d Frank said, \u201cHe was in the thick of it, you couldn\u2019t fault his technique, he was firing spells better than anyone, but we all get unlucky sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cBut he\u2019ll be all right?\u201d Remus put down his fork now, he wasn\u2019t going to eat any more.\n\u201cWith proper rest.\u201d Mrs Potter nodded, smiling wanly.\nAll of the terror Remus had been trying to ignore for the past few days came crashing back. He gripped the seat of his chair and stared at his plate and thought about Ferox, lying unconscious in the rubble. A good, strong man like that, shot down. Remus felt a stab of angry defiance in his gut, sharpening his focus. He was going to do better, no matter what it took. He was going to be quicker; braver. The next time the battle came to him, he would be ready."

            "content": "Monday 9th January 1978\nRemus wrote three letters on his last night before school that Christmas break. Two would need a muggle stamp, and were to be posted into the red Royal Mail pillar box at the end of the road before they left for King\u2019s Cross. The second could wait until he got to Hogwarts, and could use one of the school owls.\nThe first was to Hope:\n\n\nDear Ms. Jenkins,\n\n\nMy name is Remus Lupin. My father was Lyall Lupin, and I believe I am your son.\n\n\nI am now seventeen years old. I was given a letter written by you in 1965. I hope that you do not mind my writing to you. If you would like to write back, I would like that very much.\n\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n\nRemus John Lupin.\n\n\n(He thought he had better sign off with his full name, though he would be very surprised if there was another Remus Lupin living in Britain. He also thought it best to keep it short and to the point. She would appreciate that, maybe, if she chose to ignore the letter.)\nThe second letter was to Grant.\n\n\nDear Grant,\n\n\nI hope you had a nice Christmas. I wish I could have come to visit, but I stayed with my friend\u2019s family and it\u2019s hard to get away.\n\n\nI hope you\u2019re all right. How\u2019s the job going? Have you saved up for a flat, yet? I\u2019ll have to start thinking about that soon. It\u2019s my last term of school, ever, and by June I will be living in the real world. I hope I can see you then.\n\n\nPlease write back as soon as you can, and let me know how you are doing.\n\n\nYours,\n\n\nRemus.\n\n\n(He didn\u2019t want to put \u2018yours sincerely\u2019, because it seemed silly and over-formal. He didn\u2019t want to put \u2018love\u2019, because that seemed very extreme. So in the end, \u2018yours\u2019, seemed the simplest, and most honest way to put it.)\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s just the Ferox letter still to post, then?\u201d Sirius asked, as they took their seat in their usual carriage on the Hogwarts Express. They were completely alone \u2013 Peter had gone in search of Dorcas, who had apparently written him a very steamy letter over the Christmas break, while James and Lily had made a beeline for the prefect\u2019s carriage.\n\u201cJust the Ferox one.\u201d Remus nodded, patting his pocket. Sirius sat on the same bench as him, reclining back and stretching his legs out in Remus\u2019s lap, arms folded behind his head. Remus snorted indulgently, \u201cMake yourself comfortable, why don\u2019t you.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do.\u201d Sirius grinned wickedly. \u201cSo.\u201d He said, \u201cWhich letter are you most looking forward to getting a reply from?\u201d\n\u201cWhich reply am I\nmost\nlooking forward to?\u201d Remus quirked an eyebrow dryly, \u201cYou mean between my battle-wounded ex-teacher, my young-offender ex-boyfriend or the mother who abandoned me?\u201d\n\u201cWell, when you put it like\nthat\n,\u201d Sirius tutted. \u201cHonestly, the amount of stuff you keep back.\u201d\n\u201cWould you rather I was whinging all the time?\u201d Remus sighed, opening the book he\u2019d brought for the journey on top of Sirius\u2019s legs.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sirius mused, staring up at the carriage ceiling thoughtfully. \u201cBut, I mean. If you didn\u2019t have\nme\nto talk to about this stuff, I\u2019d be worried your head would explode.\u201d\n\u201cIt would not\nexplode\n, thank you very much,\u201d Remus slapped his knee lightly with the orange-covered penguin paperback. \u201cYou\u2019re so dramatic. I coped perfectly well before you decided to involve yourself.\u201d\n\u201cHow?!\u201d\n\u201cWell.\u201d Remus chewed his lip, \u201cI er\u2026 you\u2019ll think it\u2019s stupid.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 make lists, in my head. Benefits and losses. And sometimes I have pretend conversations, you know, to help me work through a problem\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBloody hell, Moony,\u201d Sirius sat up, spluttering. \u201cYou complete nutter.\u201d\nRemus laughed,\n\u201cYeah, ok. Maybe a bit mental.\u201d\nSirius slid his feet off Remus\u2019s lap and sidled up to him on the seat,\n\u201cEver had an imaginary conversation with me?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Remus replied, closing his eyes as he felt Sirius\u2019 s breath on his neck. \u201cI only have imaginary conversations with sensible people.\u201d\n\u201cWell maybe that's where you\u2019re going wrong\u2026\u201d Sirius began to kiss Remus, very lightly just behind his earlobe. Remus squirmed, the book dropped to the carriage floor.\nSuddenly, the door began to rattle open, and giggles could be heard in the corridor. Sirius and Remus leapt apart just as Marlene and another girl stumbled inside,\n\u201cOh!\u201d Marlene\u2019s eyes widened in surprise, cheeks turning pink, \u201cThought this car was empty\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d Sirius leaned back, looking amused. He was eyeing Marlene with a very wicked glint in his eye. He winked at the girl coming in behind her, a tall, dark haired sixth year Remus thought he vaguely recognised. \u201cPatel.\u201d Sirius nodded.\nOh god,\nRemus thought to himself,\ncould Sirius possibly have old conquests I don\u2019t even know about?!\n\u201cRemus, have you met Yasmin?\u201d Marlene asked, taking a seat opposite him, \u201cShe's the new Keeper.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right, hiya.\u201d Remus nodded, giving an awkward wave.\n\u201cNo Mary?\u201d Sirius was raising an eyebrow at Marlene, as if he knew something. Remus was just confused and a bit flustered.\n\u201cNo Mary.\u201d Yasmin answered, with a similar smirk.\n\u201cShe\u2019s talking to one of the Ravenclaw prefects,\u201d Marlene said, quickly, \u201cIt\u2019s not as if we\u2019re deliberately avoiding her or anything!\u201d Marlene looked\u2026 was she\nblushing\n?! Why was everybody acting so oddly? Remus shifted in his seat, noting the weird atmosphere.\n\u201cHm.\u201d Sirius said, still smiling at Marlene smugly, \u201cWhat were\nyou two\nup to, then?\u201d\nYasmin tutted, and looked him dead in the eye with a wry smile of her own.\n\u201cNothing. What were\nyou two\nup to?\u201d She raised a suggestive eyebrow and Remus nearly leapt up with shock. She\nknew\n?! Just who\nwas\nthis Yasmin person, then?\n\u201cNothing!\u201d Sirius sat up straight.\n\u201cWell then.\u201d Marlene shrugged, her face clearing as she settled back in her seat looking like she had just won a particularly rewarding game of chess. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave it at that, then, shall we?\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Sirius leaned back too, folding his arms. Yasmin giggled, and Remus just scratched his head.\n\u201c\nWhat\nare we leaving\nwhere\n?\u201d He asked Sirius, later that evening. They were making their way slowly up to the owlery before curfew. He\u2019d eaten a lot at dinner, and was somewhat regretting it, now.\n\u201cMoony, really.\u201d Sirius laughed, \u201cSomeone as observant as you hasn\u2019t noticed anything different about Marlene, lately?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d He panted, struggling as always with the spiral staircase.\nRemus didn\u2019t want to admit that if he\nwas\nobservant, it was only Sirius he was observing. He typically regarded the girls as a complete mystery, and rarely had any idea what was going on with them unless they explicitly told him. Lily and Mary did this more often than Marlene, who had always been as private as he was.\n\u201cOh come\non\n, Moony,\u201d Sirius laughed, \u201cMarlene and Yaz? Don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t see - they were all over each other before they realised the carriage wasn\u2019t empty.\u201d\nRemus stopped - partly because he needed a moment to catch his breath, partly because he couldn\u2019t believe what Sirius was saying.\n\u201cYou mean,\nMarlene\nis\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201cAnd\nYasmin\n\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201cBloody hell.\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d Sirius\u2019s eyes were glittering mischievously. \u201cCan\u2019t believe you hadn\u2019t figured it out already!\u201d\n\u201cWell.\u201d Remus huffed. They were nearly at the top, now. \u201cI\u2019m pretty impressed that\nyou did\n. Seeing as you apparently had no idea about me, after we\u2019d been shagging for a year.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a\nwhole\nyear.\u201d Sirius replied, defensively, reaching the top and looking around furtively, before continuing into the empty room.\nRemus came in behind him, and looked for an appropriate owl. It wasn\u2019t a long journey, he didn\u2019t think. He seemed to remember Ferox telling him that his grandmother lived in Liverpool. It had been a difficult letter to write, but necessary, considering they had last parted on difficult terms. He simply hoped Ferox was well, and added in a few inconsequential details about his NEWT preparation.\n\u201cSo if Marlene knows\u2026\u201d Remus said, thoughtfully, tying the letter to his chosen owl\u2019s leg.\n\u201cYeah, I know. James next.\u201d Sirius sighed.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to keep bringing it up...\u201d Remus said, apologetically, setting the owl free to fly out of the nearest window. He watched it go.\n\u201cNo, I promised I would do it.\u201d Sirius threw up his hands. \u201cAnyway, this term\u2019s going to be enough of a nightmare what with NEWTs and the war\u2026 rather not have anything else to worry about.\u201d\n\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d\n\u201cShitting myself.\u201d\n\u201cLovely.\u201d Remus rolled his eyes, \u201cCan I help?\u201d\n\u201cNot if you\u2019re going to suggest me having an imaginary conversation with Prongs\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t see why not,\u201d Remus shrugged. \u201cProngs is easy to do. Nice and predictable.\u201d\n\u201cMm, unlike some.\u201d Sirius murmured. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s not what he\u2019ll say that I\u2019m worried about. I know what he\u2019ll say. It\u2019ll be like it was when you\u2026 um\u2026\u201d\n\u201c...came out\u2026\u201d Remus prompted, helpfully. Sirius nodded, bashfully.\n\u201cI know he\u2019ll be his usual righteous self. I\u2019m more worried about the stuff he\ndoesn\u2019t\nsay...\u201d\n\u201cWell.\u201d Remus said, turning away from the window, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do about that.\u201d\n\u201cBlack?! Bla-aaack? Oi, Padfoot!\u201d Sirius's pocket began shouting at him. Sirius grinned, fishing out his compact mirror and opening it,\n\u201cSpeak of the devil.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are you, tosser?\u201d James\u2019s voice boomed out of the mirror.\n\u201cOwlery.\u201d\n\u201cMoony with you?\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201cDumbledore wants him.\u201d\n\u201cRight now?!\u201d Sirius glanced up at Remus, whose stomach sank. This was never good.\n* * *\n\nOne hour later\n\nRemus was not surprised to find all three marauders (and Lily - who by this point may as well have her own nickname and access to the map, anyway) waiting outside of Dumbledore\u2019s office for him. He was grateful - he was in such a state that if he\u2019d had to walk back to the tower alone he\u2019d probably have got lost.\n\u201cWell?\u201d Sirius asked, eager as always to be the first to know.\n\u201cUm.\u201d Said Remus.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Lily said, taking his arm gently, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell us, we just wanted to know you\u2019re ok.\u201d\n\u201cOf course he has to tell us.\u201d Sirius frowned. Remus gave him a warning glance.\n\u201cCan we go somewhere a bit more private? Not the common room\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDorm room?\u201d Peter suggested.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus nodded.\nHe wouldn\u2019t speak to them until they got there, and used the time to work out exactly how he was going to explain without hurting at least Sirius\u2019s feelings, never mind wounding James\u2019s pride. Dumbledore hadn\u2019t said he couldn\u2019t tell anyone. Only to exercise caution with who he told.\nFor your safety, and theirs\n, the old man had cautioned ominously. Remus still had serious doubts about whether or not Dumbledore was all that concerned for his safety, personally, but kept his mouth shut. You had to be careful what you said, in Remus\u2019s position.\nFinally, they all piled into the marauder\u2019s dorm room - even Lily, which was a bit weird, especially when she sat herself down on James\u2019s bed, as if she had done it a hundred times before. Remus sat on the lid of his trunk. Hadn\u2019t even had time to unpack, yet.\n\u201cSo?!\u201d Sirius asked again, impatient, leaning against his bedpost, \u201cWhat did Dumbledore want?\u201d\n\u201cHe gave me an assignment.\u201d Remus stared at the worn out rug as he said this, not meeting anyone\u2019s eyes. He still couldn\u2019t quite believe it himself.\n\u201cHe what?!\u201d James surprised Remus by speaking first. \u201cHe gave\nyou\n\u2026 not any of us?\u201d\n\u201cJames,\u201d Lily said, sharply, touching her boyfriend\u2019s arm, \u201cIt\u2019s obviously something Remus is best suited for.\u201d\n\u201cWerewolves.\u201d Sirius said. Remus looked up and met his eye. He looked upset, so Remus smiled.\n\u201cYeah. Done it before, haven\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done\u2026\u201d Lily started, then shook her head, as if thinking better of it. \u201cWhat does he need from you? Why now?\u201d\n\u201cThey think there\u2019s one in Hogsmeade,\u201d Remus explained, slowly, \u201cThe centaurs told him, or something.\u201d (He was foggy on those details, because when Dumbledore had been explaining it Remus had been trying very hard not to throw up from nerves), \u201cDumbledore wants me to um\u2026 \u2018make my presence known,\u2019 next time I\u2019m in town. See if it\u2026 er\u2026 takes the bait.\u201d\n\u201c\nBait\n?!\u201d Sirius practically shouted.\n\u201c...It\u2019s just an expression.\u201d Remus replied.\n\u201cNot a great one,\u201d Peter said, nervously, chewing his nails.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Remus shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. If there\nis\na werewolf, and it\u2019s one of Greyback\u2019s, then I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in any danger. He wants me to join him, remember?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I remember getting my\nown\ninvitation to join that side.\u201d Sirius said, with a shiver. Remus wished he hadn\u2019t brought that up. The last image he needed in his head right now was Sirius\u2019s unconscious body falling out of the Potters\u2019 fireplace on that horrible night.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be like that.\u201d He said, stiffly. \u201cNothing might happen at all, they might not even be here for me. And I was ok, last time, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cOnly because Ferox showed up!\u201d Sirius had forgotten that they weren\u2019t alone, he was gearing up for a proper row.\n\u201cI know, but I\u2019m of age, now\u2026 I\u2019ll know what to expect.\u201d Remus tried to keep his own voice placid, hoping it would remind Sirius to keep himself in check.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so dangerous, Remus!\u201d Lily started/\n\u201cI know that too, but I wasn\u2019t exactly given a choice!\u201d He snapped. She lowered her head and pursed her lips. He hadn\u2019t meant to raise his voice to her, but he\u2019d have to feel bad about it later. Just now it was too much to ask.\n\u201cWhen?\u201d Sirius asked, calmer than before.\n\u201cNext Hogsmeade weekend.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s in two weeks.\u201d James said, \u201cAfter the next moon\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to increase security in the village, obviously.\u201d Remus said. \u201cAfter last time.\u201d\n\u201cOk, I\u2019m going to need a few things explained, here\u2026\u201d Lily said, a deep crease in her forehead.\n\u201cJames, would you?\u201d Remus pleaded, \u201cI think I just want to go to bed\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d James nodded, springing into action at once. \u201cWe can talk about this tomorrow, when everyone\u2019s had some time.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Remus smiled, weakly, getting up, thinking to go and brush his teeth, looking forward to being alone in the bathroom for a few minutes to collect himself.\n\u201cMoony?\u201d James said quickly, as the others got up, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t get an assignment, or that you can\u2019t do it, or anything--\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Remus nodded, patting him on the shoulder. \u201cBelieve me, if you or Sirius could do it instead, I wouldn't be Dumbledore\u2019s first pick. S\u2019pose I just got lucky, eh?\u201d\nInside the locked bathroom, he pressed his back against the door, and tried to regulate his breathing. Now that his friends knew, it all became much more real to him. The thought that had been gnawing away at him since Dumbledore had first described the task finally sank in.\nYou never actually thought he would ask this.\nRemus chastised himself,\nyou never really believed you would be useful. Be careful what you wish for, Loony Lupin.\nDizzy and trembling, he now pressed his ear to the bathroom door. They had all left the room. All but one. He wrenched the door open without a second thought, and stood face to face with Sirius.\n\u201cYou ok?\u201d Sirius asked, his cool blue eyes full of concern. Remus shook his head.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nSirius reached out, and Remus clung to him."

He slammed them all down on the breakfast table in front of Remus, disrupting the porridge he had been picking at. He didn\u2019t have much of an appetite, somehow.\n\n\n\u201cWhat are these?\u201d He reached over to pick up the nearest book.\n\n\nAdvanced Defensive Spells.\n\n\n\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Lily straightened her back, staring over the pile with a look of bemusement, \u201cHave you been in the\n\n\nlibrary\n\n\n?! In the morning?! Instead of\n\n\nflying\n\n\n?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe need to get Moony\n\n\nprepared\n\n\n, Lily!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 you said mornings were sacred to you!\u201d Sirius said.\n\n\n\u201cYou said you had to pay homage to the gods of the quidditch pitch!\u201d Peter grinned.\n\n\n\u201cI can miss\n\n\none\n\n\nmorning.\u201d James said, dismissively.\n\n\n\u201cProngs!\u201d Remus grabbed his hand, and gushed at him dramatically, \u201cI\u2019m\n\n\ntouched\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGerrof,\u201d James snatched his hand back, ears turning bright red. \u201cYou can all stop making fun of me. Am I the only one taking this seriously?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d Sirius smirked. Remus and Peter groaned in anticipation of what was coming, \u201cI am\n\n\nalways Sirius.\n\n\n\u201d\n\n\nPeter and Remus covered their eyes in embarrassment, but it must have been the first time Lily had ever heard that joke because she snorted with laughter so suddenly that her tea shot out of her nose. This was the funniest thing that even the marauders had seen in ages, and they were all hysterical for a good five minutes - each time any of them managed to stop, Lily would snort again, or James would waggle his eyebrows and they would be helpless with laughter once more.\n\n\nWhen they\u2019d finally calmed down, Remus opened the first book eagerly and decided that he\n\n\nwould\n\n\neat his porridge after all.\n\n\nThey went to their lessons with a new sense of purpose, and James suggested that they all meet in the library after the last bell to begin work on preparing Remus for whatever was ahead. They did this every day for a whole week, commandeering a block of six desks behind some stacks in a corner, where they could have complete privacy, pushed them all together and covered the thing in textbooks on battle theory, duelling techniques, defensive incantations and hexes. Peter even made a threatening sign which read\n\n\nMarauder\u2019s War Council: Do Not Disturb,\n\n\nwhich worked like a charm (possibly because it had been literally charmed by Lily) and meant they could leave their work there and return to it whenever they liked.\n\n\nRemus abandoned his study groups, asking Christopher to take over, James nominated Marlene to take over two of his quidditch sessions, and even Lily stopped going to Slug Club meetings that week. (Though she did try to break into Slughorn\u2019s study to get her hands on some Felix Felicis for Remus, but had no luck and was almost caught). In short, all five of them spent as much time as possible working towards the same cause; preparing Remus for his mission.\n\n\nHe had been teasing James before, but Remus really was touched - only there was hardly any time to dwell on it, as they all knuckled down to study harder than any of them ever had before. Remus just thanked his lucky stars that James was so good at defense against the dark arts; they\u2019d never had a teacher stay longer than a year in that subject, so Remus\u2019s own knowledge was patchy. James and Lily\u2019s combined efforts helped him cover more ground in a week than he had since his OWLs.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re good at charms, and that\u2019s half the battle.\u201d James said, appraisingly, as they stood in the empty common room one evening, \u201cThe rest is really just quick thinking and determination.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd we\n\n\nknow\n\n\nyou can do those.\u201d LIly encouraged, tidying up the mess they\u2019d made trying to freeze sofa cushions mid-air.\n\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be like Diagon Alley,\u201d Sirius reassured him, slapping him on the back, \u201cBecause you\u2019ll know what\u2019s coming. You\u2019ve got time to get ready.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEasy enough to say\u2026\u201d Remus bit his lip. \u201cI\u2019m ok at most of this, here, with you lot, but if I was actually defending myself\u2026 and I\n\n\nstill\n\n\ncan\u2019t do a patronus.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, now, just focus on the simpler stuff.\u201d James advised, rubbing his chin, \u201cThe patronus will come - it\u2019s not as if you\u2019re not strong enough; you apparate like it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s easy.\u201d Remus sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s just thinking. Patronuses are\n\n\nfeeling\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCould somebody please let me down, now?\u201d Peter called from above their heads, where he had been paralysed mid-air.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\nDear Remus,\n\n\n\n\nThank you for writing to me. My Christmas was good. I never had turkey before, it was nice.\n\n\n\n\nNo flat yet but I am trying. Still staying with my aunt as you will see from the address, but I like it here. I like the sea and may learn to swim.\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been seeing a lad down here, but he ain\u2019t as clever as you. Nice body though.\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\n\nmiss you very much.\n\n\n\n\nYour Grant. xxx\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\nDear Remus,\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your letter, I was so pleased to hear from you.\n\n\n\n\nI would like to begin by assuring you that I am quite well following the events in Diagon Alley over Christmas. I was sorry to hear that you and your friends were there too - I had hoped the war would be long over by the time you were ready to leave school.\n\n\n\n\nI will be staying with my grandmother for a while longer. but expect to be back to work no later than Easter. I\u2019ve no doubt you will understand why I can\u2019t say any more than that.\n\n\n\n\nBest of luck with the NEWTs.\n\n\n\n\nL. Ferox.\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nSunday 15th January 1978\n\n\nBy the following weekend, they had definitely hit their stride, and Remus was feeling more confident than ever - as long as he didn\u2019t think too much about Livia\u2019s incredible ability with wandless magic. He tried to convince himself that he was\n\n\nover\n\n\n-prepared, if anything. that Dumbledore had merely required him to show his face in Hogsmeade, to see if this other wolf (if there even was another wolf) sniffed him out. He might never use anything James had taught him at all.\n\n\n\nYeah, right -\n\n\nthat nasty voice in the back of his head spoke; always late at night, when everyone else was asleep and he was most alone -\n\n\nas if you\u2019ve ever been that lucky.\n\n\n\nThey spent all day Saturday in the library, all five of them, but on Sunday Lily was required mediate a prefect dispute and Peter had an afternoon detention for poor uniform, so for a good portion of the day it was just Remus, James and Sirius working in their quiet little study nook.\n\n\nSirius and James were on the blacklist for the restricted section, so Remus went in alone, and came back with the biggest book on curses he could find.\n\n\n\u201cThere are some second years on the other side of the hall taking bets on whether we\u2019re really behind studying for NEWTs or just planning the most amazing prank Hogwarts has ever seen.\u201d He said, setting the huge tome down on top of three more.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of our legacy, aren\u2019t you, Mr Prongs?\u201d Sirius smirked over the book he was taking notes from.\n\n\n\u201cQuite so, Mr Padfoot, quite so.\u201d James replied, scanning a glossary. \u201cAh ha!\u201d He grabbed a book triumphantly, and began flipping pages.\n\n\nSirius looked up.\n\n\n\u201cFound something good?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d James murmured, reading fast.\n\n\nRemus began to look at the contents of the book of curses. The chapter titles were truly horrible, and he hoped he\u2019d never actually have to use any of this stuff.\n\n\n\u201cOk,\u201d James said, \u201cLook that this.\u201d He had finished reading, and flipped the book to show Remus and Sirius, who were on the other side of the table. \u201cI really think this sort of thing plays to your strengths, Moony. It's all intuitive stuff with a lot of punch behind it, the way you do pranks.\u201d\n\n\nSirius and Remus both stood to pour over the book, leaning forward on the desk. Remus's shoulders were still so sore from the last moon - the pain-free days between moons seemed to be getting shorter the older he got; his tendons felt like hard knotted rope rubbing against the bone. He stretched to rub a particularly sore spot while he read, pressing down with his fingertips and breathing in slightly at the pain.\n\n\nSirius moved closer, and - perhaps without thinking - reached out to rub the sore spot with his own long fingers. He was much better at it than Remus, who felt a wave of relief as Sirius worked small, soothing circles into his muscle. He sighed, tiredly.\n\n\nRemus was the first to finish reading, and looked up at James. The bespectacled young man was not looking at the text, though. He was staring at them, across the table. Specifically at the point where Sirius's hand was touching Remus's neck. James\u2019s mouth had fallen slightly open, and there was a question in his eyes.\n\n\nRemus moved to alert Sirius, who finally looked up at his friend. Seeing immediately what he had done, he just stared back, still for a moment. Remus half expected him to step away, withdraw his hand. But he didn\u2019t. Instead, Sirius wrapped his arm around Remus's shoulders, and squeezed him, very deliberately, all the while holding James's gaze.\n\n\nJames closed his mouth, looked at them both again, and nodded, wordlessly. Remus straightened up, letting Sirius\u2019s arm drop.\n\n\nHe had to leave them alone, that much was obvious. He cleared his throat,\n\n\n\u201cEr. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a book I\u2019ve read which goes into more depth than this. I\u2019m think I\u2019ve got a copy upstairs, I\u2019ll er\u2026 just go and get it\u2026 see you in an hour or so, maybe?\u201d\n\n\nSirius and James nodded, still staring at each other. Remus left, quickly, glad the library was almost empty. He felt hot and cold all over, a feeling similar to guilt, even though he knew he ought not to feel it. Halfway to the tower, he bumped into Lily,\n\n\n\u201cHiya, Moony,\u201d she grinned, \u201cSeen Potter?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLibrary,\u201d Remus said, \u201cBut I\u2026 wouldn\u2019t, if I were you. He and Sirius are having a chat.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I can interrupt a chat\u2026\u201d she started off. Remus touched her arm quickly,\n\n\n\u201cLily, no.\u201d He bit his lip, \u201cSorry, but I really think you ought to give them a bit of time. Sirius really needs it, ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?!\u201d Lily looked startled by his seriousness.\n\n\nRemus sighed, heavily. Well, she was about to find out, anyway, and it was as much his his to tell as it was Sirius\u2019s.\n\n\n\u201cUm\u2026 come with me, shall we go outside?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk\u2026\u201d Lily followed him, looking curious and concerned at the same time, a little crease forming in her freckled brow.\n\n\nOutside in the crisp winter sunshine everything seemed a bit cheerier. Remus steeled himself, stomach roiling. He had to keep reminding himself that he\u2019d been wanting this; to have it all out in the open. Only now, it seemed utterly terrifying. They wandered towards the lake. Remus gazed across the surface, squinting against the reflected shards of dazzling light.\n\n\n\u201cRemus?\u201d Lily asked, \u201cYou\u2019re making me nervous!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry!\u201d He blinked, \u201cEr\u2026 it\u2019s about me and Sirius.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou and Sirius? Oh no, what have you done? Only you two could get in trouble during\n\n\nthe first week back.\n\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing like that!\u201d Remus laughed, despite himself. He rubbed the back of his head, casting around for the right words, \u201cLook, you know how you\u2019re always saying I should... find someone?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Lily frowned again, searching his face.\n\n\nRemus raised his eyebrows, waiting for her to get there. It took longer than he\u2019d expected, but her eyes widened suddenly. \u201cOh my god!\u201d\n\n\nShe covered her mouth with her hands and sat down rather suddenly on the nearby stone bench. Remus sat beside her, slowly, his joints stiff. \u201cSirius?!\u201d She said.\n\n\n\u201cSirius.\u201d He nodded.\n\n\n\u201cOh my god.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026 sorry.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, Remus, don\u2019t be sorry, I just\u2026 wow, ok, give me a minute.\u201d\n\n\nHe did, waiting patiently, looking out at the lake. He didn\u2019t look at her, because it didn\u2019t matter. Lily would be ok, Lily would take it in her stride.\n\n\n\u201cAnd he feels the same way? You\u2019re\n\n\nsure\n\n\n, Remus?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t be surer.\u201d Remus smiled - it was suddenly very easy to smile. He pulled his cloak and the neck of his jumper aside covertly, to show her the reddish-purple bruise Sirius\u2019s mouth had left there a few nights before.\n\n\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d She said again. He covered it up, blushing, but still smiling. \u201cDoes James know?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s finding out right now. That's why I wanted you to give them a bit of space.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, no, of course.\u201d She nodded, \u201cI understand.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to tell you for ages.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAges? How long has it been\u2026?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSince the summer. Well. It got serious over the summer. But\u2026 we were um\u2026 well there was stuff going on for a while before that. Since Sirius broke up with Mary.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBloody hell.\u201d She shook her head again. \u201cSo, what? Sirius is your boyfriend? Are you\n\n\nin love\n\n\nwith him?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWoah,\u201d Remus blinked, shuffling away, \u201cI mean, steady on! Let's just um\u2026 look it's out now and that's plenty.\u201d\n\n\nLily gave him a very long, appraising stare. Then she nodded.\n\n\n\u201cAll right then.\u201d\n\n\nRemus raised his eyebrows.\n\n\n\u201cAll right then?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou said it\u2019s serious, though. He\u2019s not just\u2026 um\u2026 it\u2019s not just messing about?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo. Definitely not. I know it\u2019s unexpected\u2026\u201d\n\n\nLily shook her head and looked at him with big, earnest eyes.\n\n\n\u201cAre you happy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Without hesitation.\n\n\n\u201cAll right, then.\u201d She said, briskly, back to her sensible self. She leaned over and kissed his cheek. \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t take divination, because it's bollocks, but I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re all in for a \u00a0really crap time quite soon.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy god, you sound more like James every day, it's ridiculous.\u201d Remus snorted. She slapped his knee, lightly,\n\n\n\u201cListen to me! It's going to be\n\n\nhard\n\n\n. And it's happening faster than I thought it would. It's going to be scary, all the time, for a\n\n\nlong\n\n\ntime. But if we can keep being happy together, and making\n\n\neachother\n\n\nhappy\u2026 then good. Brilliant. If it's Sirius for you, and you for him, then brilliant.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJesus, Evans.\u201d Remus buried his face in her hair, pulling her into a huge hug.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nLily and Remus waited another half an hour or so before returning to the library, where they found that the books had all been taken out, and James and Sirius were gone. Remus didn\u2019t have the map on him, but fortunately Lily knew James, and they headed straight for the quidditch pitch.\n\n\nSure enough, two familiar figures were racing through the air between the goalposts on their brooms. James was winning, but not by much - Remus could tell by Sirius\u2019s posture that he was pushing as hard as he could - he hadn\u2019t seen him concentrating like that on flying since being kicked off the team.\n\n\nLily and Remus sat, companionably in the lower stands, and waited, rehearsing a few basic defense spells.\n\n\n\u201cSo last time I met a werewolf--\u201d Remus was saying.\n\n\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe that happened\u2026\u201d Lily shook her head, amazed.\n\n\n\u201c--Ferox showed up and fired some silver chains at her, so she apparated pretty quick. I could try that, but I\u2019m only\n\n\nok\n\n\nat transfiguration, and what if the silver backfires and gets me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere might be a potion that helps with your silver problem\u201d Lily chewed her quill, \u201cI\u2019ll ask Slughorn. But otherwise it might not be worth the risk.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFair enough\u2026\u201d\n\n\nTHUD, THUD. Two sets of heavy boots landed before them. James and Sirius stood panting and sweating, both clutching their brooms. Lily twirled her hair around her finger and tilted her head, and Remus fought not to do the same.\n\n\n\u201cAll right, lads?\u201d She broke the ice. They nodded.\n\n\n\u201cNeeded a break.\u201d Sirius explained, apologetically. \u201cChange of scenery.\u201d\n\n\nRemus looked up at James, nervously.\n\n\n\u201cAll right, Prongs?\u201d He asked, just managing to keep the tremor out of his voice.\n\n\nJames looked at Sirius, then down at Remus. He shook his head, looking down, and reached an arm out, yanking Remus to his feet,\n\n\n\u201cCome here you big prat,\u201d he boomed, enveloping him in a bear hug."

            "content": "\u201cYou\n\n\ntold\n\n\nhim!\u201d Remus kissed Sirius as soon as they were alone.\n\n\n\u201cWell, he worked it out\u2026\u201d Sirius said, laughing, as he was pushed backwards into their bedroom. Lily and James had to head a prefect\u2019s meeting and Peter was still in detention. Remus had dragged Sirius upstairs as fast as he could, all aches and pains forgotten.\n\n\n\u201cBut you\n\n\ntold\n\n\nhim.\u201d Remus insisted, running his tongue up Sirius\u2019s neck, collarbone to earlobe. Sirius shuddered and the backs of his knees hit the bed frame. Remus gave him a shove that was half urgent, half playful, and they fell back together.\n\n\n\u201cMerlin,\u201d Sirius gasped, as Remus continued his assault, climbing on top of him, a knee ether side of Sirius\u2019s hips, \u201cIf I\u2019d known this was how you\u2019d respond, I\u2019d have told Prongs ages ag--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut. up.\u201d Remus kissed him hard on the lips, hands on Sirius\u2019s belt. Sirius obeyed.\n\n\nRemus was a bit surprised, too. Who\u2019d have thought that confession was such a turn on? If he wasn\u2019t careful, he\u2019d be telling everyone he met.\n\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d he said, half an hour later, sitting by the window in his boxers, lighting a cigarette. Sirius lay on the bed, still, vaguely stunned and staring at him. \u201cIt went well?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHm?!\u201d Sirius blinked very slowly, as if his eyelids were heavy. Remus grinned, exhaling smoke, trying to aim it through the crack in the window,\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nJames\n\n\n. What did he say?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think the first thing was \u2018what the fuck are you playing at\u2019, but it got better from there.\u201d Sirius snorted.\n\n\n\u201cDid he ask lots of questions?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSort of. Nothing I didn\u2019t expect, I s\u2019pose. What about Evans?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe said \u2018oh my god\u2019 about a hundred times, but she came around fairly quickly.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cProngs too. Except the prat won\u2019t tell Wormtail for us, says we have to do it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell. Fair enough.\u201d Remus sucked on his cigarette again, then blew smoke into the room, watching it fill the space between them. \u201cWhat questions did he ask?\u201d\n\n\nSirius closed his eyes, breathing in.\n\n\n\u201cNothing scandalous. How long for, when did it start, why didn\u2019t I tell him\u2026 that sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI told the truth. Roll us a fag?\u201d\n\n\nRemus already had. He held it out. Sirius rolled onto his stomach and reached his long pale arm through the smoke to take it, placed it between his pursed lips and snapped his fingers. He sucked, then rolled back, exhaling with a sigh.\n\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you feel?\u201d Remus asked, unable to tear his eyes away. It still seemed miraculous beyond belief.\n\n\nSirius Black, naked, in my bloody bed\n\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cRight now? Bloomin\u2019 marvellous.\u201d Sirius winked, wickedly. \u201cAbout Prongs? Ok. Good, I think.\u201d He stretched, hand disappearing under one of the pillows. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Remus blushed, jumping up from the window, \u201cI got some letters back. Ferox is ok. And, erm\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGrant.\u201d Sirius\u2019s lip curled as he picked up the postcard Grant had sent from Brighton. It had a colour photo of the pier on the front, the sea looked blue and the sun was shining. Remus was so glad he had sent it. It was nice to picture Grant in a bright, cheerful place like that. Sirius continued smoking as he read it. \u201cHe\u2019s seeing someone with a nice body but he misses you?!\u201d\n\n\nRemus jumped onto the bed and snatched the card away, raising it aloft so Sirius couldn\u2019t reach.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s seeing someone with a nice body\n\n\nand\n\n\nhe misses me. Separate statements.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell.\u201d Sirius folded his arms, lying back again, stiff puffing, \u201cI hope you\u2019re writing to him about\n\n\nmy\n\n\ngorgeous body.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Remus laughed, laying back down beside him. They stared up at the red velvet bed curtains together. \u201cYou\u2019re not really jealous, are you?\u201d Remus asked, tentatively.\n\n\n\u201cPfft, no.\u201d Sirius nudged him gently with his elbow. \u201cCurious, maybe\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAbout...?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you think? You and him! You\u2019ve never told me any detail\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe were fifteen, there\n\n\nwas\n\n\nno detail. Just snogging.\u201d Remus tutted, \u201cHonestly, what a thing to ask.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJames did, about us.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe never!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t, but I knew he\n\n\nwanted\n\n\nto.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo he didn\u2019t, you\u2019re just being vain.\u201d Remus leaned over to stub out his cigarette in the cold cup of tea on his nightstand. Sirius caught him at the hip and pulled him over. Remus closed his eyes and let himself be pulled.\n\n\n---\u201cThank Godric I had the map, I would have gone to the libr--MERLIN\u2019S BALLS!\u201d The door flew open and Peter stood gaping in the doorway, clapping his hands to his eyes.\n\n\nRemus leapt up from the bed as if Sirius was on fire, and began scrabbling about for his trousers on the floor, shouting,\n\n\n\u201cSorry Pete, sorry Pete! Shit! Shit! Shit!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d Peter shouted back, still covering his eyes.\n\n\nSirius yanked the duvet up, staring at them both, then burst out laughing,\n\n\n\u201cWormy, we\u2019ve got something to tell you.\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nFriday 20th January 1978\n\n\nPeter took a little while to get used to it, but then they all did, really - even Remus and Sirius. They kept forgetting that the marauders knew, and they\u2019d grown so used to consciously avoiding each other that they were oddly shy to show any sort of affection in front of the others. Of course, Remus kept reminding himself, it was better to keep a low profile anyway; they still had the rest of the school to worry about.\n\n\n\u201cYou could tell Christopher, though.\u201d Sirius said, as they left the library for the last time before the Hogsmeade trip. It was almost midnight and they\u2019d had to be chased out by Madam Pince, who wouldn\u2019t let them stay any longer, even when Lily and James had flashed their Head Girl and Boy badges.\n\n\n\u201cOh,\n\n\nnow\n\n\nyou remember his name,\u201d Remus yawned, clutching his books to his chest - really just for something to hold on to.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just\n\n\nsaying\n\n\n,\u201d Sirius caught the yawn and covered his mouth, but continued speaking, \u201cHe already knows half of it, no harm telling him the rest. Not really fair to let him keep pining away for you when there\u2019s not a chance in--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSirius Black, are you jealous?!\u201d Lily cackled, giggly with overtiredness.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sirius sniffed, nose in the air, \u201cI just don\u2019t want any misunderstandings.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell if I survive tomorrow then I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d Remus yawned again.\n\n\nThat made everyone go quiet and he regretted saying it. They walked back to the common room in solemn silence. Gryffindor tower was peaceful and mostly empty - a few stray second years up past their curfew fled to their dorms as soon as they saw James and Lily, and the marauders took their usual seats by the fireplace. Remus settled into his armchair and immediately returned to the book he had been reading before Pince had so rudely interrupted.\n\n\nSirius flicked his wand at the kettle hanging over the fireplace and Lily summoned some clean tea cups from the cupboard, but still no one spoke until the water was boiled and the tea brewing in its pot.\n\n\n\u201cMoony,\u201d Sirius said, softly, \u201cPut down the book, eh? We\u2019ve done so much already.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t feel like enough.\u201d Remus replied, feeling prickly and irritable. \u201cI know I\u2019m missing something.\u201d\n\n\nEveryone kept\n\n\nstaring\n\n\nat him, and by now he didn\u2019t know whether it was because they were amazed (or repulsed) about the whole Sirius thing, or whether they were convinced he was about to run away and join the werewolves.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s loads.\u201d James said, now pouring the tea and handing Remus a saucer, \u201cHonestly, you know enough now to walk any Defence Against the Dark Arts exam. Might as well bunk off the rest of the year.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis isn't an exam.\u201d Remus snapped. The cup and saucer shook in his hands, so he set it down on the arm of the chair. He had a feeling Sirius had noticed that, but hopefully no one else.\n\n\n\u201cBut Moony,\u201d Peter slurped his own tea noisily, \u201cYou\u2019ve done this before. Last year.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d James nodded, encouragingly.\n\n\nRemus sighed, and said no more. What was the point; whinging wasn\u2019t going to get him anywhere. He sipped his tea, willing his hand to stay steady. This was potentially the worst time of the month for a mission, he couldn\u2019t help thinking. Only four nights away from the full moon and his magic felt stronger than usual, but also less predictable. He was restless, his skin crawling, his senses bare and his mood hot. He knew he was forgetting something. He just\n\n\nknew\n\n\n. A dark feeling of foreboding that told him all the curses in the world would be no good.\n\n\nHe stood up, sharply, knocking the teacup off the armchair. Sirius was quick, and stopped it mid-air with a flick of his wand. Remus ignored this.\n\n\n\u201cGoing to bed.\u201d He said, cracking his knuckles.\n\n\n\u201cOk, Moony,\u201d James nodded, brightly. He glanced at Lily, \u201cThink we\u2019ll stay down here for a bit.\u201d\n\n\nPeter looked at Sirius, and then Remus with an expression of faint terror. Remus tutted.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, Wormtail, I really am just going to sleep. See you all tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t sleep. His brain wouldn\u2019t let him. He hated Dumbledore, and he hated Greyback, he hated the war, and as the hours got smaller and smaller, he hated Peter too.\n\n\nHe did not hate the other werewolf, though; the one who was not Greyback. Just as he had not hated Livia, though she frightened him. The more Remus thought about what was ahead of him, the less sure he was about his preparedness.\n\n\nYes, he knew more curses and hexes now than Regulus and Severus combined (probably), but the more he thought back to his encounter with Livia, the less useful these things seemed. Hadn\u2019t she said it herself?\n\n\n\u201cYou can wear that uniform and wave your silly stick, but you know that you have more in common with me than anyone in that castle.\u201d\n\n\nHe knew she was stronger than him; she could hurt him if she wanted to - but she hadn\u2019t, not really. Instead, he remembered the pity he had felt, immediately after their meeting. He remembered the desire to help her, and his conversations with both Ferox and Dumbledore.\n\n\nAs dawn broke, Remus lay wide awake, thinking at a million miles an hour, his heart hammering and his stomach fizzing with excited anticipation. If he had to go to war, then fine. But this was\n\n\nhis\n\n\nbattle, and it would be on his terms.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nIt was an April morning when they told us we should go\n\n\n\n\nAs I turned to you, you smiled at me\n\n\n\n\nHow could we say no?\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, the fun to have\n\n\n\n\nTo live the dreams we always had\n\n\n\n\nOh, the songs to sing\n\n\n\n\nWhen we at last return again\n\n\n\n\nSlipping off a glancing kiss\n\n\n\n\nTo those who claim they know\n\n\n\n\nBelow the streets that steam and hiss\n\n\n\n\nThe devil's in his hole\n\n\n\n\nSaturday 21st January 1978\n\n\nBreakfast that morning was a bleak affair. Remus was ravenously hungry, but no one else seemed to be eating. Sirius was on black coffee, and it was already making him jittery; he kept bobbing up and down in his seat. Mary and Marlene were the only ones acting halfway normal, because neither of them knew about the assignment.\n\n\n\u201cThree Broomsticks, later?\u201d Mary asked, brightly.\n\n\nLily and James nodded, trying to smile, and succeeding only in looking slightly deranged. They were holding hands under the table again, and Remus was trying not to think about it, instead reaching for the plate of bacon for another helping.\n\n\n\u201cCan I bring Yaz?\u201d Marlene was asking Mary. Mary raised an eyebrow,\n\n\n\u201cI mean, I\n\n\nsuppose\n\n\n\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGreat.\u201d Marlene grinned. Mary\u2019s mouth twisted, but she didn\u2019t say anything.\n\n\nThe walk into Hogsmeade seemed longer than ever. Fortunately Lily and James had duties to perform, so at least they weren\u2019t following Remus about, just\n\n\nwaiting\n\n\n. Unfortunately, Sirius had enough nervous energy for three people, and Remus could feel it coming off him in waves.\n\n\n\u201cWhere shall we go?\u201d He murmured, low enough so only Peter and Remus could here.\n\n\n\u201cEverywhere, I s\u2019pose.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWould it help if I was Padfoot?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you like.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShall I change too?\u201d Peter asked.\n\n\n\u201cIf you like.\u201d\n\n\nRemus was unable to summon up very much interest. He was too busy trying to work out whether or not Hogsmeade smelled genuinely different, or whether it was because he usually tried to ignore scents as a human.\n\n\nThey ducked into a shop alleyway and Peter and Sirius transformed behind some bins. Wormtail crawled onto Remus\u2019s palm, and he sat him on his shoulder. The weight was a small comfort, even if his whiskers tickled Remus\u2019s neck. Nice to have Padfoot too, big and black and excitable, trotting alongside like a loyal companion. Yes. Much better when your friends aren\u2019t human, in Remus\u2019s opinion. At least, right now.\n\n\nThey walked. Remus deliberately avoided the highstreet, instead wandering around the backs of the houses. How many people lived in Hogsmeade? How many were potentially in danger, without even knowing it? He tried sniffing the air, and it was like exercising a muscle he had allowed to atrophy.\n\n\nSome scents came through stronger than others. Padfoot, obviously, and Wormtail. Household waste from the bins, compost from back gardens, and magic - that heavy, iron taste which settled on his tongue like treacle when he was this close to the moon. Other students, the sickly sweet aroma of Honeyduke\u2019s and the comforting smell of parchment emanating from Scrivenshaft's.\n\n\nThe forest. He could smell the forest, if he really tried. He closed his eyes briefly and inhaled. Green, lush, dense, teeming with life\u2026 and magic. At first it seemed like an indulgent whim, just an idea that he rather liked the smell, and wanted to get closer. But the further they walked, and the closer they got, the more important it felt. Remus had the impression that something had been drawing him in this direction for some time now.\n\n\nThe Forbidden Forest loomed large over the little village, miles and miles of darkness and danger, against a backdrop of blue-grey snow capped mountains. For the first time (as a human, anyway) Remus had the urge to go in - to explore.\n\n\nPadfoot whined beside him as they left Hogsmeade and the road behind them. He wondered if Sirius could smell it too, but it was impossible to get any kind of sense out of him in dog-form. Remus tried to switch off his rational mind for a moment - was there anything there at all, or was he just overthinking?\n\n\nThe magic in the forest wasn\u2019t the same as at Hogwarts; it wasn\u2019t human, it didn\u2019t have that metallic, gunpowder smell Remus had come to associate with most witches and wizards he knew. It was more organic; less precise; a heady, mulchy smell of soil and decay. There was power, in there. He knew this instinctively - dizzying, huge, earth moving power. It would have been frightening, once. But the closer Remus grew, the surer he was - the power was\n\n\nhis\n\n\n, if he wanted it. All he needed to do was let it in. Another scent revealed itself; an animal; blood. Remus felt the wolf inside stir, and his desire to enter the forest grew almost impossible to resist.\n\n\nPadfoot barked, sharply, and ran in front of him. The great black dog turned on Remus, raising its hackles and emitting a low growl. Remus blinked, snapping back into himself. Wormtail was speaking and quivering on his shoulder - maybe had been for a few minutes, now.\n\n\n\u201cSirius.\u201d Remus frowned. \u201cMove.\u201d\n\n\nPadfoot continued to growl. Wormtail gave another squeak, before scuttling down Remus\u2019s robes into his left pocket. Remus felt hot and angry - as if something had been snatched from him that he wanted. That he\n\n\nneeded\n\n\n. He made to move forward, and Sirius transformed back into himself.\n\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?!\u201d He said, still blocking Remus\u2019s way. \u201cCan\u2019t you smell it?!\u201d\n\n\nRemus stopped trying to get past and caught Sirius\u2019s eye,\n\n\n\u201cCan you?\u201d He whispered, not quite believing it.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something bad in there. It must be the wolf.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is.\u201d Remus nodded, eagerly. Surely that was\n\n\nobvious\n\n\n?!\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be sure, though.\u201d Sirius frowned.\n\n\n\u201cI can.\u201d Remus replied. \u201cLet me past.\u201d\n\n\nSirius moved again, blocking him.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d He said. \u201cYou\u2019ve done what you said you\u2019d do. We know it\u2019s there. Let\u2019s go back, now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Remus stared over Sirius\u2019s shoulder, into the dark, wintry wilds beyond. He wanted this so badly. More than he\u2019d ever wanted anything; except - maybe - the boy standing before him. \u201cI have to.\u201d He finished. It was an insufficient explanation, but it was all he had.\n\n\n\u201cThere you lot are! Where\u2019s Pete?\u201d\n\n\nSirius and Remus\u2019s deadlock was interrupted by James\u2019s cheerful shout. They both turned to see him striding towards them from the village, Lily at his side. \u201cWhat are you doing all the way out here? Thought you were supposed to be trailing your scent all over town or something.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re just coming back now.\u201d Sirius said - which Remus thought was pretty cheeky, not to mention presumptuous.\n\n\n\u201cYou lot can.\u201d Remus said. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot what?\u201d Lily asked, confused. \u201cWhere\n\n\nis\n\n\nPeter?\u201d\n\n\nRemus could feel the warm weight of Wormtail\u2019s furry little body in his pocket, but said nothing. James had been agonising for months over when the break the animagus thing to his girlfriend, and now was definitely not the right time.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not coming back with you. I have to go in there.\u201d He pointed at the forest, aware of how mad he sounded.\n\n\n\u201cYou what?!\u201d James looked concerned. His eyes flicked to Sirius automatically, which only annoyed Remus even more. Sirius wasn\u2019t his keeper, for god\u2019s sake.\n\n\n\u201cThe wolf\u2019s in there.\u201d Sirius explained, \u201cAnd Moony\u2019s gone completely mental and decided he has to go in and face it right\n\n\nnow\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nRemus\u2019s head snapped back to Sirius, outraged and betrayed.\n\n\n\u201cI have\n\n\nnot\n\n\ngone mental, you prick!\u201d He said, fiercely. How could he explain that this was just what had to happen? That he\n\n\nknew\n\n\nit, deep in his marrow; at his very core. \u201cYou lot go back, or wait here. You won\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHelp us understand, Remus,\u201d Lily came forward, gently, \u201cThis isn\u2019t like you, barrelling into a fight\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus nearly laughed in her face. Did no one remember who he was? What he was?\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to\n\n\nfight\n\n\nanyone.\u201d He said. \u201cI just want to talk to them. That\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to do.\u201d\n\n\nThey were all staring at him, unconvinced. His anger flared again, and he had a very unpleasant thought - that he could very easily get past them, if he wanted to. The magic in the forest was more than enough; it made him feel strong. He could force his friends to stay in place, and it wouldn\u2019t even tire him out, he probably wouldn\u2019t even need his wand. This notion burned so brightly it frightened him.\n\n\nHe looked at Lily again, refusing to look at Sirius or James. \u201cWe were wrong - this isn\u2019t a battle. And\n\n\nI\u2019m\n\n\nnot a weapon against the werewolves,\u201d he tried to explain, \u201cI\u2019m a\u2026 I dunno, a way in. They need to know I don\u2019t mean any harm.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut Remus, if they\u2019re on you-know-who\u2019s side\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not!\u201d He snapped. \u201cNot all of them.\u201d\n\n\nLily looked uncertain, and Sirius was practically burning a hole in the back of Remus\u2019s head with his indignance. Remus ran his hands through his hair. They weren\u2019t going to understand. How could they? He barely did. \u201cLook.\u201d He said. \u201cThis is important, and I need you all to trust me.\u201d\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a request, and nor was it received as one. James and Lily looked at each other, then at Sirius. James nodded.\n\n\n\u201cOk, Moony.\u201d\n\n\nSirius made a noise of protest, but Remus was too far gone now to care. He would make it up to him later, when he could think clearly; when every instinct in him wasn\u2019t telling him to run into the forest at full pelt.\n\n\n\u201cOk.\u201d He nodded back. \u201cStay here.\u201d A tug in his midriff as the magic \u00a0took over - he would never be sure whether or not he had done it on purpose, and at the time he simply did not care.\n\n\nHe turned and began to walk into the forest, quickly, his long legs making long strides, his friends behind him, unmoving, unable to follow."

            "content": "It was easiest not to think, for the next few minutes at least. Remus did not slow down, or tire as quickly as usual - even his hip had stopped hurting. Despite the wheedling guilt he had to keep at bay, he had not felt so good in months. The scent grew stronger as the woods grew thicker, and a shade of darkness fell, casting strange shadows which seemed to move in the corners of Remus\u2019s eyes.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t think. It was too late to think; he was too far gone.\n\n\n\nBloody hell\n\n\na voice in his head popped out of nowhere,\n\n\nwhen you go for it you really go for it, don\u2019t ya sweetheart?\n\n\n\nGrant. Remus didn\u2019t want to do this, now.\n\nShut up\n\n, he willed his brain.\n\n\n\nOh, charming!\n\n\nGrant\u2019s voice cackled,\n\n\nhere I am, only tryna help. Don\u2019t I always try to help?\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t need help\n\n.\n\n\n\nIf you didn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\n\n\nGrant\u2019s voice countered.\n\n\nI could be someone else, if you prefer? Lots of sensible people to choose from. I\u2019ve got Ferox here, wanna chat wif him? Or Lily, though she\u2019s a bit whingy, if you ask me\u2026 Dumbledore? Nah, bit of a prick. Ooh, how about your poshboy? Eh, \u2018Moony\u2019?\n\n\n\nShut\n\n\nup\n\n\n.\n\nRemus repeated, walking faster, breathing harder.\n\n\n\nYeah,\n\n\nGrant\u2019s voice agreed, slyly,\n\n\nI can see why you wouldn\u2019t wanna talk to \u2018im, after what you just done.\n\n\n\nI had to.\n\nRemus insisted.\n\nNone of you would understand.\n\n\n\nWell they won\u2019t now, you lunatic.\n\n\n\nRemus ignored the voice. There was no time for this; he would just have to deal with the consequences later. He knew there was no coming back from it now, not really.\n\n\n\nHope you like the woods, Remus,\n\n\nGrant was whispering, now,\n\n\n\u2018Cos no one\u2019s going to want you back in civilisation after that mess.\n\n\n\nShut up, shut up, shut UP.\n\nRemus raged inside his head, like a mad person; like someone deranged. Perhaps it had been a mistake, to go alone. Perhaps he really had lost it, and his friends were only trying to keep him safe\u2026\n\n\nNo. He caught the scent again, and it stirred up his insides so much that he felt as though he was being propelled by it; dragged forward, unable to resist. It was a feeling he had only ever associated with transformation before, and he had no more control over it in his human form than the wolf did. It was him - the other wolf, somewhere out there. Remus had to find him, or else\u2026 well, he wasn\u2019t sure, but it wasn\u2019t even worth considering.\n\n\nSomething moved, just ahead, and Remus froze. The different scents of the forest began to pile up, he had to concentrate to identify and categorise each one. There was magic. And there was a different kind\u2026 it wasn\u2019t the wolf; it was female - or feminine, at least, and not lupine at all.\n\n\nHe walked towards it, confused. It was very close, but he couldn\u2019t see anything. He found himself in a grove of silver birches - spindly, ghostly white trees with papery bark that glowed in the darkness of the woods. The scent was strong, but still nothing - and he had lost the wolf\u2019s trail.\n\n\nImpatient, Remus pulled out his wand, and cast a revealing spell.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nAparecium.\n\n\n\u201d His wand seemed to jump in his hand, the force of the magic was so strong.\n\n\nAn anguished wail filled the air, and the tree closest to Remus was no longer a tree, but a young woman. A dryad. She was beautiful - in her own way. Slender and tall as the trees she guarded, her skin glowed as white as silver bark, and her hair rustled with brittle wintry leaves. She rounded on him, baring sharp, yellow teeth, and he staggered back, shocked and amazed.\n\n\n\u201cGo away, nasty thing.\u201d She hissed, eyes narrowing. They were the colour of new spring leaves, unnaturally bright and fierce. \u201cI dealt with the other, I\u2019ll deal with you too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhich other?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe other half-beast.\u201d She glowered. The dryad was at least a head taller than him, and advanced at a steady pace, roots unfurling from the soles of her feet and winding towards him. As dreadful and fearsome as she was, Remus had to stay focussed on his goal.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for him - the other. I mean\n\n\nyou\n\n\nno harm, or your\u2026 er\u2026 trees.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWizards do not belong here.\u201d She continued to scowl, \u201cEven half-beast wizards. Get out.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI will, as soon as I\u2019ve---\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNasty, cruel, wicked creatures, foul, unnatural, don\u2019t belong, too dangerous...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a full moon,\u201d he insisted, \u201cI\u2019m not going to transform, I swear!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot wolf.\u201d She rasped, very close to him now, ivy and nettles winding their way towards him, covering his shoes. \u201cWizard. Wolf is welcome. Wolf is natural.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Remus didn\u2019t have a response to that, and the vines were tickling his ankles now, stinging him as they tightened. He still had his wand. He still had every curse he\u2019d spent the last two weeks practicing. But now that the time had come to use them, Remus\u2019s conscience pricked.\n\n\nThe dryad was only doing what she was\n\n\nsupposed\n\n\nto do; guarding her trees.\n\n\n\u201cPlease!\u201d Remus said, holding his hands up, hoping he looked deferential, \u201cI promise I won\u2019t hurt you, or anyone - I just need to find the other\u2026 the other wolf. Then I\u2019ll go, I really will!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLying, false-tongued, dirty\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI swear!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd the little one?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat!? Who?!\u201d\n\n\nClose up, he could see that her face was not smooth, like human skin, but finely lined and cracking, like bark; coal black beneath the tissue thin outer layer. She gave another harsh wail, and raised her hand. Remus flinched, but she didn\u2019t touch him - instead, there was a violent shaking inside of his robe pocket, and Wormtail came flying out, falling to the mulchy ground below with a soft \u2018pat\u2019.\n\n\nShit.\n\n\nRemus thought.\n\n\nBloody Peter!\n\n\n\nThe dryad raised her arm again, and Peter transformed into his human shape, trembling and cowering on the ground.\n\n\n\u201cPlease, please don\u2019t hurt me!\u201d He whimpered, covering his face. Remus stepped in front of him, quickly. Of all the people to have at your side in a situation like this.\n\n\n\u201cLiar!\u201d The dryad hissed again triumphantly, leafy hair bristling, \u201cDeceitful, filthy wizards\u2026\u201d\n\n\nShe was raising both arms now, and her eyes had darkened to the colour of pine needles. Remus was now completely sure that she meant them serious harm; every one of her pointed little teeth was showing. He couldn\u2019t disarm her, she didn\u2019t have a wand. He wasn\u2019t even sure if the usual defensive spells would work on her. Remus had just decided to use a knockback jinx to buy himself some time, when --\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nC-c-confringo\n\n\n!\u201d Peter squeaked from behind him, pointing his stubby little wand over Remus\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\n\nOh jesus christ\u2026\n\n\nRemus thought, as he ducked, reflexively. Fortunately, Peter was either so frightened, or just inept, that the blasting curse didn\u2019t have its usual devastating effect. Still, it was enough to cause some serious damage to the trees behind the dryad, setting a few leaves on fire. She screamed, a heart wrenching, painful screech, and turned immediately to tend to the smoking branches. Peter and Remus took their chance and ran, vines snapping as they tore their feet from the ground.\n\n\nPeter followed Remus, but neither of them were especially fast runners, and by the time they judged it safe to stop, they were both wheezing heavily.\n\n\n\u201cBloody\u2026 hell\u2026 Pete\u2026\u201d Remus panted bending forward, one arm against an oak for support.\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do!\u201d Peter replied, red faced, pale hair plastered to his forehead. \u201cLet\u2019s go back, Remus, please\u2026\u201d He looked around, anxiously. They were even deeper in the woods now, and other than their own labored breathing it was deathly quiet.\n\n\nStill, Remus shook his head, straightening up.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cI have to find them. She hurt him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo\n\n\nwhat\n\n\n?!\u201d Peter replied, indignant, \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to be here!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry you got caught up in this,\u201d Remus frowned, impatiently. Now that they weren\u2019t in immediate danger, his desire to hunt the other wolf down had returned. He could smell blood; he was sure of it. \u201cBut I have to. You can go back, if you want - go and find the others.\u201d\n\n\nPeter looked behind him, then back at Remus, his eyes big and shimmering,\n\n\n\u201cOn my own?\u201d The tremor in his voice was palpable, and Remus suddenly wanted him gone more than anything in the world, in case the terror was catching.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you my watch, so you don\u2019t get lost.\u201d Remus offered.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Peter stiffened his lips, \u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d\n\n\nPete\u2019s heartbeat was almost deafening, and Remus was starting to feel sorry for him.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIf something happens, you can just transform back, and go and tell the others, can\u2019t you? You\u2019ll know the way better, as a rat.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t leave you, Remus,\u201d Peter whispered, shakily, \u201cI can be brave, I know I can.\u201d\n\n\nRemus squeezed his shoulder.\n\n\n\u201cFine. This way. Keep as quiet as you can.\u201d\n\n\nThe dryad had not come after them, thank goodness. Remus couldn\u2019t remember everything about tree guardians, but he was fairly sure they couldn\u2019t leave their groves. Or maybe that was naiads? He couldn\u2019t remember the difference.\n\n\nBut it didn\u2019t matter now, he\u2019d picked up the scent properly. A mouth watering, rich, iron tang that made his stomach growl shamefully. They were still days out from the full moon, but that didn\u2019t seem to matter to the wolf inside Remus, who was scaling the walls of its prison, howling for freedom.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s close.\u201d Remus whispered to Peter, as they pressed through a heavy thicket, probably announcing their arrival to every creature nearby.\n\n\nThere was another heartbeat, not very far away, and that sounded frightened, too. A few steps more and Remus could hear laboured breathing; like someone who had been struggling for a while now, and was beginning to tire. Closer still and he could smell the sweat - and the rage - from this struggle. It was such a strong mix of emotions and energy, that Remus was momentarily lost in the fog of it, too overwhelmed to see a clear direction. Then it changed - stilled, suddenly. A harsh voice rang out, shattering the quiet of the woods, shaking birds from their nests;\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nRemus Lupin\n\n\n!\u201d\n\n\nPeter gave out a sharp squeak of terror, before leaping a foot in the air, transforming, and turning tail, scampering away from Remus. No matter. Remus stood taller.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d He whispered, back.\n\n\n\u201cCome to me.\u201d\n\n\nThat tugging sensation returned to Remus\u2019s chest, and he followed it, letting himself be drawn forward, through to a small clearing of trees. At its centre was an ancient yew, gnarled and creaking, and bound to the trunk was a young man. The dryad had him tied in place with miles of cruel, twisted bramble. The thorns were cutting into his worn leather cloak, and puncturing the skin of his neck. His arms were at his sides, and despite obvious attempts to free himself, the brown, sinewy stems held firm.\n\n\nHe wasn\u2019t struggling now, though. He was just staring at Remus, head bent forward, eyes dark and inscrutable. His head was shaved, as Livia\u2019s had been, and his clothes were weather worn and threadbare, but there the resemblance ended. He was tall; as tall as Remus, and perhaps only a few years older. His skin was as dark as tanned leather, his features handsome and striking. He smiled, slowly, showing rows of straight white teeth.\n\n\n\u201cRemus Lupin. Set me free.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Remus held back, gripping his wand inside his pocket.\n\n\n\u201cI am Castor. Set me free. I am your brother.\u201d\n\n\nRemus cocked his head. This man was trapped. Utterly at Remus\u2019s mercy. He felt his courage returning.\n\n\n\u201cMy brother, are you? Greyback send you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell.\u201d Remus leaned against the nearest tree and folded his arms, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to give me a decent reason to set you free then, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\nCastor roared, furiously, fighting against his bonds once more, tearing his clothes and driving the thorns deeper into his neck. He was clearly very strong, with a broad build, thick biceps flexing against the vines.\n\n\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d Remus tutted, conversationally, \u201cLooks like you\u2019re not going anywhere without me.\u201d\n\n\nHe would later wonder where this ridiculous sense of cockiness had come from. After all, the situation Remus now found himself in was every bit as dangerous as the attack on Diagon Alley, which had turned his mind inside out. Perhaps it was the woods, and the power he could feel coursing through him. Perhaps it was Grant\u2019s voice, still ringing in his ears. Perhaps it was simply the familiarity of the situation. Remus had been facing off against bullies who thought they had him figured out since he was six years old. \u201cSo?\u201d He said, smiling, \u201cWanna talk?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was sent to talk.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally? Just talk?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust talk. Set me free.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d Remus played with the tip of his wand, thoughtfully, as if he hadn\u2019t a care in the world. \u201cSee, I\u2019ve got a bit of a problem believing you, Castor, mate. Seeing as the last time Greyback sent someone to \u2018just talk\u2019 to me, an innocent woman ended up dead.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy father recognises his mistake in sending Livia.\u201d The werewolf said, earnestly. He had calmed down a bit, now, and was clearly watching Remus to see where this was going. \u201cSo this time he has sent me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can see right through that, too, you know,\u201d Remus mused, \u201cThought a good looking bloke might\u2026 er\u2026 peak my interest, did he?\u201d\n\n\nCastor kept staring at him, eyes narrowing. Remus shrugged and continued, \u201cI mean, I\u2019m flattered, Castor, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re lovely, but I\u2019m still not interested. And I have to say, so far I\u2019m not very impressed. Not as good at magic as your pal Livia, then? She\u2019d have apparated right out of that, no trouble.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat tree-bitch!\u201d Castor snarled, struggling again, \u201cWhatever she\u2019s done, these vines\u2026 I can\u2019t use magic\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh I\n\n\nsee\n\n\n!\u201d Remus nodded, \u201cWell, must remember to thank her, next time I see her.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLivia told me about you,\u201d Castor said, \u201cShe said you\u2019re Dumbledore\u2019s pet hound, toothless. Wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly, wouldn\u2019t chase a rabbit on a full moon.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m nobody\u2019s pet.\u201d Remus replied, his jaw clenching. \u201cAnd nor should you be. What\u2019s so great about Greyback, eh? What do you lot think\u2019s going to happen to you when we defeat Voldemort?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe same thing that always happens to our kind.\u201d Castor replied, giving Remus a pitying look, \u201cWe will be hunted and oppressed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to change that?\u201d Remus implored, taking a step forward. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a family, in the real world? Don\u2019t you want a family, one day?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe are a pack. We are everything.\u201d\n\n\nRemus sighed.\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. He\u2019s lying to you. I know there\u2019s a way to make things better, to really change the way we\u2019re treated, but it can\u2019t be like this, don\u2019t you see?\u201d\n\n\nCastor sneered at him disdainfully.\n\n\n\u201cJust as Livia said. Toothless. Told father you weren't ready. Told him it was too soon.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cToo soon for what?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFor the big night, of course,\u201d Castor was smiling again, a sinister grin which made Remus feel queasy. The werewolf continued, recognising Remus\u2019s uncertainty, \u201cOn the night of the next moon, the pack will be on the hunt. It will be a hunt such as the world has not seen since the dark ages.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d There was a quaver on Remus\u2019s voice now, as much as he tried to disguise it, \u201cYou know I\u2019m going straight to Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\nCastor laughed, a breathless, hollow sound coming from deep in his chest.\n\n\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d\n\n\n*CRACK*\n\n\nRemus winced as the air around them shimmered slightly, and he staggered back from the figure who had appeared between them in the clearing. She hissed, low under her breath, steely eyes flicking from Remus to Castor. Livia.\n\n\n\u201cSister!\u201d Castor rasped, straining for freedom once more, \u201cRelease me!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou have failed our father.\u201d She replied. \u201cPunishment awaits.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Castor protested, \u201cIt was the dryad, I could not--\u201d\n\n\nLivia raised a hand, and Castor was silenced, unable to move or make a sound. Remus\u2019s insides froze as she turned on him.\n\n\n\u201cHello, my love. Are you ready?\u201d\n\n\nRemus pulled his wand out and pointed it at her, assuming a duelling stance and rooting himself to the ground. She would not hold him, this time. This time he knew what to expect.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, Livia.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t time for this, the moon approaches.\u201d She tutted, walking towards him, as ragged and filthy and wild as he remembered her. \u201cDrop that silly stick.\u201d She raised a hand and twisted it mid air, as if she was turning a door knob. Remus felt the strength of it, prying his fingers apart, his wand burning in his hand, but this time, he did not drop it. He clenched his teeth and gathered every ounce of magic from the woods around him.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus Lupin.\u201d She growled, \u201cYou will come with us.\u201d\n\n\nShe raised both arms now, and flicked her fingers, so that they fanned out from her palms. The trees surrounding Remus caught light in an instant, from trunk to branches, blazing columns of fire roaring around him. He was terrified, but he was not letting go.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d He repeated, stepping backwards, slowly. He would run, if he had to, let the dryads deal with them - let the centaurs do it, come to that. You didn\u2019t just show up in a forest like this and start burning it down.\n\n\nLivia snapped her fingers then, and at once Castor was freed from his bondage, gasping and snarling. He joined his pack mate, and now there were two of them, their eyes glowing like hot coals, reflecting back the flames surrounding them.\n\n\n\u201cThe time has come, Remus Lupin,\u201d they said, in unison, as black smoke began to fill the air, the scent of sap and pine fizzling around them.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d He said again, though he could see no way out, now. \u201c\n\n\nMordeo\n\n\n!\u201d He shouted, aiming his wand at them, as he backed away. Castor recoiled, growling, but Livia laughed throatily, and waved her hand again, dismissing the curse as if it was no more than a cobweb.\n\n\nThis was it. They were going to take him - god knows where - and make him one of them. He would never see his friends again, never see Sirius again. He had been such an idiot, forcing them to stay behind. Now there was nobody left to protect him.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s you.\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t recognise this voice. It wasn\u2019t Grant\u2019s, or anyone he\u2019d \u2018spoken to\u2019 before. But maybe it was right. There was a spell he hadn\u2019t considered, simply because he had never mastered it properly. But he was in dire straits now, and he had more power than ever before at his disposal.\n\n\nAs bright embers and burning leaves rained down on the three of them, Remus gathered all of his resources; \u00a0his strength, and his rage, and every joy in his heart. He would have to be ready to run, as soon as the incantation was spoken. If it failed, he would have no time at all to make his escape.\n\n\nHe breathed in, carefully, and - just before he cast the spell - recalled Sirius\u2019s eyes, and Sirius\u2019s mouth, and Sirius grinning.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m mental about you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nExpecto Patronum!\n\n\n\u201d He practically screamed it, extending his arm, directing his wand as an enormous silver animal burst forth, leaping towards Livia and Castor, huge jaws wide, claws bared. In the split second before he began to run, Remus saw them both cover their eyes, and turn to run in the opposite direction as the great beast lunged at them.\n\n\nBut there wasn\u2019t time to stay and enjoy his success, so he didn\u2019t. He ran again, for the edge of the woods; back to Hogsmeade, and the wizarding world, and his friends. Remus ran so hard that his legs were burning, and the pain in his hip was like a spear in his side, but he did not stop, lungs full of woodsmoke and eyes watering, he just kept going until the trees began to thin, and the light grew stronger.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nPeter and Sirius were still there. Sirius was pacing erratically back and forth on the footpath. Peter was sitting on the ground with his knees drawn up, staring at the woods. He looked as though he had been crying.\n\n\nRemus staggered out into the daylight, and felt ready to collapse right there. Peter stood up, wiping his eyes in disbelief, and Sirius ran towards him, and then stopped, suddenly, and was knocked back, as though he\u2019d hit a wall. Furious, he gave out an angry grunt. Remus allowed one of the knots inside him to unravel, and the barrier was lifted. He limped towards his two friends, wheezing.\n\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d He murmured.\n\n\nMuch to his surprise, Sirius threw his arms around his neck, and held him tightly. His heartbeat thrummed against Remus\u2019s, and he hugged him back, exhausted and grateful.\n\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t come and help.\u201d Sirius said, his voice hoarse and hollow, \u201cWhatever you did\u2026 we couldn\u2019t follow you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Remus said, again.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Remus!\u201d Peter suddenly burst out, his eyes filling with tears again, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d Remus reached out an arm to pat his shoulder, but Sirius wouldn\u2019t let him go yet. Finally, Remus came back to his senses, and gently untangled himself, \u201cI have to see Dumbledore, right now. Where are the others?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey had to go back,\u201d Sirius explained, \u201cCurfew. They said they\u2019d tell McGonagall.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d Remus nodded. \u201cCome on, we have to go, now.\u201d He began to hobble towards the village.\n\n\n\u201cMoony, are you ok?\u201d Sirius hurried alongside him, an arm under his shoulder for support.\n\n\n\u201cJust tired,\u201d Remus said.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re covered in\u2026 is that soot?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere was a fire\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWormtail said something was summoning you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t explain it, yet, please don\u2019t ask me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d There was a cold edge to Sirius\u2019s voice which Remus didn\u2019t like, but he kept supporting him, and he kept going, so it would have to be ignored for now. One thing at a time.\n\n\nMcGonagall was waiting for them at the school gates, her arms folded, deep lines creasing her forehead.\n\n\n\u201cProfessor!\u201d Remus spluttered, still coughing up smoke, \u201cI\u2019m sorry we missed the curfew, but I need to see the headmaster right--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes of course, Lupin, come with me.\u201d McGonagall nodded, quickly, and took his arm from Sirius. She peered down at Sirius and Peter. \u201cYou two go to the tower and say nothing. I don\u2019t want any arguments, do you hear me?\u201d\n\n\nThe two young men were so surprised by these sharp instructions that they both nodded and left, immediately, Sirius throwing one glance back at Remus.\n\n\nHe told Dumbledore almost everything. He told him about the scent, and the dryad, and Castor. About the fire, and the plans Greyback had for his pack, and Livia. He did not mention the barrier he had somehow conjured, to keep his friends back. Nor did he explain that he had known how dangerous it would be, or that he had ignored every ounce of good sense he had in order to pursue Castor.\n\n\nDumbledore seemed very pleased, nonetheless.\n\n\n\u201cEverything you have told me is immensely useful, Remus.\u201d The old man said, smiling across his desk at Remus with eyes twinkling with pride, for the first time Remus could remember. \u201cYou were very brave, and fulfilled your task admirably.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I did? Even though I went in the forbidden forest?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou followed your quarry. And I don\u2019t see that any harm has come to you? You are clearly a formidable wizard, like your father.\u201d\n\n\nRemus felt a very small twinge of pleasure at that, which put him more at ease.\n\n\n\u201cThis attack, though\u2026 the hunt they\u2019re planning--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLet the Order deal with that.\u201d Dumbledore shook his head, placing his hands on his desk and rising to his feet. \u201cYou have done quite enough - more than anyone could expect of a seventeen year old wizard.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, but if I can--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am sorry I asked this of you, Remus.\u201d Dumbledore came around his desk and placed a friendly hand on his shoulder. \u201cI hope I will not have to ask again.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on your side.\u201d Remus replied, feeling he ought to reiterate this. \u201cI\u2019ll do what has to be done.\u201d\n\n\nDumbledore\u2019s eyes glittered with triumph, and his grip tightened on Remus\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThe fire had been put out by the naiads, according to McGonagall, who walked him from Dumbledore\u2019s office to the infirmary. There had been no trace of Livia or Castor, and it was assumed they had apparated.\n\n\nMadam Pomfrey tutted over him, cleaned off the soot and administered a pain killing draught. By then he was breathing normally again, and perversely quite fancied a cigarette, though he didn\u2019t tell her that. Food was brought to him there, because by this time he had missed dinner, and he ate a pleasant, quiet supper in Madam Pomfrey\u2019s homely little office.\n\n\nThankfully, he was permitted to walk back to Gryffindor tower alone. His friends were all waiting - not in their usual place by the fire, but in a quieter corner, near one of the far windows. They were all speaking in serious, hushed tones, and their heads turned at once to face him as he appeared through the portrait hole.\n\n\nHe walked over, a bit woozy from the draught he\u2019d taken, and they made room for him to sit in the window seat, squashed between Lily and Sirius, who quickly squeezed his hand, before letting go. They all stared at him, and waited for him to speak, so he did.\n\n\nHe told them as much as he could - and a few things he hadn\u2019t said to Dumbledore. Peter had luckily already covered the dryad, and apparently the marauders had spent much of their evening explaining the animagus secret to Lily. Still, she covered her mouth in horror when Remus talked about encountering Castor, and Livia\u2019s incredible powers, and the fire\u2026 Sirius was practically quaking with rage beside him, but held his tongue the whole time, and let Remus finish.\n\n\n\u201cBloody hell.\u201d James said, once the story was told. \u201cWell done on the patronus, though, mate.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Remus blushed, slightly. Trust James to find something praiseworthy, in all of that.\n\n\n\u201cDid you see what it was?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d he said, quickly, \u201cIt happened too fast.\u201d\n\n\nNot long afterwards, they all trailed up to bed, one at a time, each of them with their faces set in a determined mask. Remus realised that he was not the only one who had had a very trying day. He took a quick shower, to get the last of the forest off him, and brushed his teeth without looking in the mirror, too afraid of what he might see there. Sirius still hadn\u2019t tried to talk to him, or confront him about the terrible betrayal back at the forest edge, but Remus was certain this was yet to come, and though he knew it would be hard, he looked forward to clearing the air.\n\n\nFor hours, he lay in bed, waiting and hoping. Sirius always came to him, on a night like this; if something had happened. Sirius always knew when Remus needed to talk; even when Remus didn\u2019t want to, Sirius could get it out of him, and make everything right again. Remus waited for a long time.\n\nCome on,\n\nhe thought to himself,\n\nI\n\n\nneed\n\n\nyou, where are you?\n\n\n\nHe ain\u2019t a mind reader, sweetheart.\n\n\nGrant\u2019s chirpy voice broke through once more.\n\n\nHe knows me, though.\n\n\n\nOh yeah? You ever told him?\n\n\n\nRemus declined to answer, because it was no longer necessary. Working through problems in your head using imaginary roleplay was all well and good. But that\u2019s what he\u2019d done when he\u2019d felt most alone. When he thought he\u2019d had no one else to turn to. He realised with a sickening sense of shame just how stupid he\u2019d been. Without wasting another moment, he slid out of bed and crossed the floor. He parted Sirius\u2019s bed curtains, and whispered into the darkness,\n\n\n\u201cSirius?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sirius was lying on his back, too, hands folded over his middle like a tombstone effigy. His coldness made Remus flinch, but he swallowed his pride.\n\n\n\u201cI need you.\u201d\n\n\nSirius turned his head at once. He sighed and pulled back the covers.\n\n\n\u201cGet in.\u201d\n\n\nRemus scrambled inside, eagerly. They lay next to each other, on their sides, staring at each other.\n\n\n\u201cDo you hate me?\u201d Remus asked.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sirius replied, voice still empty.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I wanted to protect you all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know. That\u2019s what James said.\u201d Sirius\u2019s voice had melted slightly, and was now more petulant than angry.\n\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s no excuse,\u201d Remus continued. \u201cI just\u2026 I wasn\u2019t myself. Do you understand?\u201d\n\n\nSirius shrugged, moving the bed sheets so that they slid off his shoulder, exposing his collar bone. Remus tried not to get too distracted by that, and licked his lips, meeting Sirius\u2019s eye again.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything.\u201d He said.\n\n\n\u201cYou told us.\u201d Sirius replied, tetchily.\n\n\n\u201cNot everything.\u201d Remus replied, \u201cThere are things I don\u2019t want everyone to know about. But. I want\n\n\nyou\n\n\nto know. If that\u2019s ok?\u201d\n\n\nSirius stared at him as if he couldn\u2019t believe his ears. A small smile ws creeping onto his face, and he was obviously trying to suppress it.\n\n\n\u201cGo on, then.\u201d\n\n\nSo he did. He told him every feeling he had had - the irresistible pull into the forest, the rugged power of natural magic, the terrible guilt. By the time he had stopped speaking, he realised that Sirius had reached out to him, and was stroking his arm, gently, back and forth to comfort him.\n\n\n\u201cWhat made you think of casting a patronus?\u201d\n\n\nRemus snorted, lightly,\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stupid. Voice in my head.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot like the normal voices, though. Usually it\u2019s someone I know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe this time it was just\n\n\nyou\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nRemus thought about this. It made him feel funny. Sirius was still watching him, still stroking his arm. Remus remembered something else.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wolf. My patronus. I didn\u2019t want the others to know, I don\u2019t want them to think\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d never think badly of you, Moony, they know you too well.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo they, though? After today\u2026 I just feel so stupid. I got so caught up, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I just kept getting in deeper and deeper.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut you did the right thing, in the end.\u201d Sirius said, firmly, gripping him now, \u201cThat\u2019s all that matters.\u201d He leaned forward and kissed Remus gently on the lips, a calming gesture. \u201cYou came back to us.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Remus looked down, lowering his voice to barely a whisper. He looked up at sirius again, meeting those perfect blue eyes. \u201cI came back to\n\n\nyou\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nSirius kissed him again, harder, and did not stop for a long time."

Nearly eight, you lazy sod.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a free study day, arsehole, piss off.\u201d Sirius groaned in reply, burying his head under his pillow.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll miss breakfast!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUrrgh.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine, starve then.\u201d James replied. Then, \u201cSeen Moony? His bed\u2019s empty - don\u2019t think he should be off on his own, do you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cErr\u2026\u201d Sirius lifted the pillow from his face, and looked at Remus, raising an eyebrow in question.\n\n\nRemus stared back in panic. Ok, James\n\n\nknew\n\n\nbut so far they\u2019d managed to avoid his having any actual encounters with their relationship. Remus was very particular about it; he didn\u2019t want to be gawked at. He wanted to prove that everything was just the same as before, and that meant that what happened between him and Sirius in private ought to be kept\u2026 well, private. He\u2019d been fastidious about bed sharing, making sure to get up early and creep back to his own bed, or else rumple his bedsheets and head straight for the shower. But it was the full moon, and he was slower than usual.\n\n\n\u201cProbably gone for breakfast, mate.\u201d Sirius called back. He shrugged at Remus.\n\n\n\u201cYeah maybe\u2026\u201d James agreed, \u201c...Oh, hang on, I\u2019ll check the map, he's left it on his bedside table!\u201d\n\n\nRemus slapped his head, astounded by his own stupidity.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in here, James!\u201d He shouted, quickly, feeling himself turn red with embarrassment.\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d They heard James stop still, just outside the bed curtains, \u201cOh\u2026 er, right, of course! Sorry, I\u2026 er\u2026 didn\u2019t think\u2026\u201d His steps receded quickly, towards the door, \u201cSorry lads\u2026 er\u2026 see you later, eh?\u201d The door slammed shut.\n\n\nSirius snorted with laughter as Remus crawled under the sheets as if he could escape the embarrassment there.\n\n\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Sirius laughed, trying to pull the sheets back, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s horrible.\u201d Remus replied, burying himself further, \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to look him in the eye again!\u201d\n\n\nSirius crawled under the sheets too, chasing him.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we were\n\n\ndoing\n\n\nanything - you\u2019ve still got your pyjamas on!\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nProngs\n\n\ndoesn\u2019t know that!\u201d Remus retorted, sitting cross legged, facing Sirius. It was like they were under their own little tent now, and reminded Remus of camping. That was such a nice memory that he felt a bit calmer. Even better; Sirius always held his hand when they were hidden away like this, and he reached out now, playing with Remus\u2019s long, scarred fingers as though they were precious treasure.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what the fuss is about,\u201d Sirius mused, lacing his soft white fingers between Remus\u2019s, then splaying them out, then wiggling them, like a children\u2019s game. \u201cI\u2019m sure he already assumes\u2026 some things.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSee! You can\u2019t say it either!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell. I\u2019m a gentleman.\u201d Sirius smirked, looking up at him now. Even in the dark, Remus could feel Sirius\u2019s eyes burning. He was biting his lip, too. Remus gave a little sigh, and Sirius quirked an eyebrow. \u201cAt least we know we\u2019ve got the room to ourselves\u2026\u201d he placed a hand on each of Remus\u2019s knees and leaned in.\n\n\nRemus kissed him, but pushed him away,\n\n\n\u201cNo way, if we don\u2019t go down there\n\n\nright now\n\n\n, James is definitely going to think we\u2019re\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShagging?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...being\n\n\nphysically intimate.\n\n\n\u201d Remus said, piously.\n\n\nSirius burst out laughing again, and rolled back on the bed.\n\n\n\u201cOh Moony! You kill me. What happened to that rough little yob I used to know?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSome posh boy taught him to read.\u201d Remus replied, dryly, flinging back the covers and rubbing the static out of his curls. \u201cRight. Quick shower, then we\u2019ll go down.\u201d He jumped out of bed, wincing a bit at the bright sunlight filling the dorm room.\n\n\n\u201cI like the sound of that!\u201d Sirius called from the bed as Remus crossed the floor. In the bathroom doorway he turned and gave Sirius his most withering look.\n\n\n\u201cDown\n\n\nstairs\n\n\n. Pervert.\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n8:30 AM\n\n\nJames couldn\u2019t quite look at either of them in the eye, as it happened - much to Sirius\u2019s amusement. Peter had his head down too, quietly shovelling porridge into his mouth, and for a horrifying moment Remus wondered whether he had told James exactly what\n\n\nhe\n\n\nhad seen in their bedroom, only a few short days ago. That would be too much to come back from, Remus was sure.\n\n\nHe distracted himself by listening to Mary talk, which was always easy to do. She was going out with a boy on the Hufflepuff quidditch team these days, and was simultaneously extolling his virtues and bemoaning the pitfalls of seeing an athlete. Remus couldn\u2019t help but think that Mary was preaching to the choir a bit, as of course Lily (and, if Sirius was to be believed) Marlene were both going out with quidditch players too.\n\n\n\u201cI mean, obviously he\u2019s fit. Like\u2026 Adonis level.\u201d She gushed, dreamily, \u201cAnd talk about\n\n\nstamina\n\n\n\u2026\u201d\n\n\nMarlene was rolling her eyes, and James was staring fixedly at his cup of tea while Lily giggled behind her hands. Mary was gloriously oblivious, in her element. \u201cBut then he has the gall to whine about thigh chafing from his bloody broom!\u201d She cackled.\n\n\nJames\u2019s ears had turned bright red, and Sirius was trying to catch his eye, a manic grin on his face.\n\n\nMary carried on; \u201cI told him if he thinks\n\n\nthat\u2019s\n\n\nuncomfortable, he should try bleeding from his snatch five days a month.\u201d\n\n\nPeter practically choked on his porridge, Lily covered her face, and Marlene slammed her hand on the table,\n\n\n\u201cFucking\n\n\nhell\n\n\n, Mary! Do you have to?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Mary sat up, blinking, looking as though butter wouldn\u2019t melt on her wicked tongue.\n\n\n\u201cWell. You\u2019re being a\n\n\nbit\n\n\ngraphic, for the breakfast table\u2026\u201d Lily said, diplomatically.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all adults, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Mary arched an eyebrow, \u201cWe\u2019re mature enough to talk about\n\n\nsex\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight, I\u2019d better be off!\u201d James leapt to his feet, uncharacteristically clumsy, rattling the table as he did so. Lily looked up at him, surprised,\n\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPotions!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for another fifteen\u2026 Ok, wait, I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d She got up, still giving her boyfriend a strange look, and they left together.\n\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know James was such a prude.\u201d Mary commented.\n\n\n\u201cOh, it wasn\u2019t you, MacDonald.\u201d Sirius explained, stretching his arms over his head and touseling his long hair, \u201cProngsie-boy just had a bit of a surprise this morning -- ow!\u201d\n\n\nRemus had kicked him sharply under the table. Marlene watched them both, sipping her tea with a knowing look. Fortunately, at that moment, the post owls swooped into the Great Hall, and a large barn owl dropped two letters in front of Remus\u2019s plate. He snatched them both up, eagerly.\n\nOne was a postcard from Grant - forwarded on via the Potters\u2019 - \u00a0with a lewd cartoon on the front, depicting a man on the seashore holding an enormous red stick of Brighton rock against his crotch. The back just read \u2018\nSaw this and thought of you.\n\nLooking at flats next week! Love.\n\u2019\n\nRemus grinned at this, and handed it to Sirius, who scowled comically. The second letter was from Professor Ferox, with a list of book recommendations Remus had requested on the history of the magical creatures classification system. They\u2019d been writing back and forth since Christmas; it seemed Ferox was bored with his recuperation, finding himself at a loose end.\n\n\nSirius watched Remus finish reading the letter.\n\n\n\u201cAnything from\u2026?\u201d He asked, giving a significant look. Remus shook his head. Nothing from his mother. Sirius tried to flash him a cheering smile, \u201cStill time, eh?\u201d\n\n\nRemus just shrugged.\n\n\n\u201cGoing to the library, see if I can find any of these before History of Magic.\u201d He held up Ferox\u2019s list. \u201cSee you later, girls.\u201d He nodded at Mary and Marlene.\n\n\n\u201cSee you in the hospital wing, this evening?\u201d Marlene asked, hopefully.\n\n\nAh, Remus remembered, it was Tuesday. He hadn\u2019t been attending the healing lessons Madam Pomfrey had kindly included him in for some weeks now - too busy memorising curses. He didn\u2019t\n\n\nreally\n\n\nwant to go this evening, it being a full moon, but he looked at Marlene and felt guilty.\n\n\n\u201cOf course!\u201d He nodded. \u201cSee you then!\u201d\n\n\nSirius bounded happily alongside Remus as he made his way to the library, mentally working through his timetable for the day. He only had three classes, luckily, but he\u2019d promised to catch up with Christopher at some point, and he wanted to write back to both Grant and Ferox, and he had an Arithmancy essay due\u2026\n\n\n\u201cMoooooony? Earth calling planet Moony\u2026!\u201d Sirius interrupted his thoughts.\n\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe just walked past the library, if that\u2019s where you were heading\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh! Bollocks.\u201d Remus turned 180 degrees and started back, Sirius still in tow.\n\n\n\u201cCare to share?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, nothing. just thinking.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot worrying, I hope? About tonight?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm a bit.\u201d They entered the library and had to be quiet as they passed Madam Pince\u2019s desk.\n\n\nHe\u2019d actually been trying not to think about the coming moon - after all, Dumbledore had said not to. He\u2019d said the Order were dealing with it, and Remus could only hope that that meant Alastor Moody was on the case, which made him feel slightly better. Still, Castor\u2019s warning had been ringing in his ears since Saturday, and it was impossible to forget.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we ought to leave the shack, tonight.\u201d Remus whispered. \u201cIf anything happens\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t, Dumbledore\u2019s dealing with it.\u201d Sirius replied, leaning against the nearest bookcase casually, while Remus looked for the texts he wanted. Remus had to stop himself from tutting. James and Sirius put so much faith in Dumbledore, he often wondered whether he was missing something. But then, Remus trusted very few people over the age of eighteen; with good reason.\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d He said, calmly, \u201cBut I\u2019d like you to respect my wishes, if it\u2019s all the same to you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t be like that,\u201d Sirius chided, gently, \u201cOf course we will. Anything for our Moony.\u201d\n\n\nRemus found three of the books on Ferox\u2019s list, which cheered him up a bit. He took then to Madam Pince, then began to tuck them into his bag.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take them,\u201d Sirius offered, holding out his hands, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be lugging them around all day, I\u2019m going back to the dorm anyway.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, cheers.\u201d Remus handed them over. \u201cAre you going to start on that Arithmancy essay?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot if I can possibly avoid it.\u201d Sirius pulled a face. \u201cSee you at lunch? You\u2019re free this afternoon, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 yeah, but I\u2019m supposed to be seeing Christopher\u2026 then there\u2019s that essay you\u2019re not doing, and healing class. And I really want to write back to Ferox\n\n\ntoday\n\n\n, if I can, I think he likes getting the post, since he\u2019s not allowed out much.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMerlin, Remus,\u201d Sirius was shaking his head, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be at the Shack by six!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware,\u201d Remus replied, offhandedly, adjusting his book bag. It could really do with another mending spell; unless you held it just right the seams started splitting.\n\n\n\u201cAnd are you planning to eat?!\u201d Sirius continued.\n\n\n\u201cWhen have I ever forgotten a meal?\u201d Remus poked his tongue out. \u201cAnyway, I have to run - History. See you at lunch!\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n1:50 PM\n\n\nIn spite of his promises, Remus was extremely late for lunch, and had missed everyone except Sirius, who had waited back.\n\n\n\u201cSorry!\u201d Remus gasped as he reached the table, a little breathless from running. He sat down, \u201cStayed back to talk to Kettleburn, then remembered I\u2019d forgotten my notes in Professor Binns\u2019 room. History was a bloody waste, too, all stuff I\u2019ve covered in the reading--oh, thank you!\u201d\n\n\nSirius had pushed a plate of sausage and mash across the table to him. Remus dug in, eating and talking as quickly as he could - they only had ten minutes before lunch was over and the school choir would want the Hall for their weekly practice sessions. \u201cAnyway, it worked out nicely in the end, I used the time to write my letter to Ferox\n\n\nand\n\n\na note for Grant, so at least that\u2019s done -- what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\nSirius had slid a stack of parchment across the table now. Remus drained his glass of pumpkin juice and looked down at it. \u201cArithmancy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYour essay,\u201d Sirius said, casually, \u201cFinished mine, like a good boy, so I thought I\u2019d do yours too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou what?\u201d Remus did a double take. Sirius was ridiculously good with a quill, and had mimicked his own spidery handwriting perfectly. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow many times have you done it for Wormy? Or James, for that matter - he\u2019s still got a stick up his arse about this morning, by the way, won\u2019t talk to me about it - anyway, now that\u2019s done, and the letters, you\u2019re free for the afternoon!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks so much, Padfoot, honestly, this is brilliant\u2026 but I did promise to see Christopher, and--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNope.\u201d Sirius was grinning like the cat who\u2019d got the cream. \u201cJust saw him. Told him you weren\u2019t well, so you couldn\u2019t see him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSirius!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell you\u2019re\n\n\nnot\n\n\nwell.\u201d Sirius responded, innocently. \u201cWhat with tonight, you ought to be resting.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine once I\u2019ve eaten.\u201d Remus replied shortly, eyes on his food, mopping up the last of the gravy with his mashed potato. He\u2019d lick the plate if he was shameless enough; full moons made him ravenous. When he\u2019d finished, he looked up and found Sirius staring at him, big eyes full of puppy-ish remorse.\n\n\n\u201cAngry with me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus wiped his mouth with his sleeve and pushed his plate away in time for it to vanish back down to the kitchens. \u201cBut you can\u2019t re-organise my life like that just to get your own way...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that!\u201d Sirius sat up, looking shocked, \u201cI just\u2026 you always have so much on, and it\u2019s insane. I mean, it\u2019s amazing, because you\u2019re amazing, and you can handle it, but you don\u2019t\n\n\nhave\n\n\nto.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk\u2026\u201d Remus frowned, getting up. He wasn\u2019t sure exactly what Sirius was saying. He had always tried to keep busy. He\n\n\nliked\n\n\nbeing busy, and useful to people.\n\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019d written so many notes for that essay it practically wrote itself.\u201d Sirius continued, as they left the Great Hall and began to head for Gryffindor tower. \u201cAnd we can go and find Christopher if you want, he\u2019s probably in the library\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSirius\u2026\u201d Remus sighed, fondly.\n\n\n\u201cGo on, I\u2019ll post the letters for you, and I\u2019ll see you for early dinner -\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSirius...\u201d He checked the coast was clear - everyone was in lessons, and Peeves wasn\u2019t about. An empty corridor was a rare thing at Hogwarts.\n\n\n\u201cOh bugger!\u201d Sirius slapped his forehead, \u201cI\n\n\ncan\u2019t\n\n\ndo early dinner, I\u2019ve got that detention with Filch. Only for an hour though, I\u2019ll be out in time for--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSirius!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d He finally stopped talking in time for Remus to catch him unawares with a quick kiss on the lips.\n\n\n\u201cShut up, you idiot.\u201d He smiled, \u201cI\u2019d\n\n\nmuch\n\n\nrather spend the afternoon with you than studying with Christopher.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Sirius blushed, looking very pleased.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n2:15 PM\n\n\nLess than twenty minutes later, and Remus was completely blissed out, lying on his back with the record player at his feet and Sirius\u2019s head resting against his good hip. Bowie was singing and strumming his eight string, and the two boys listening were sharing a spliff Sirius had charmed off a Ravenclaw earlier that week.\n\n\n\u201cDoes the wolf get stoned too?\u201d Sirius asked, reaching up for his turn. Remus shook his head, inhaling deeply and passing the joint.\n\n\n\u201cHungrier, probably.\u201d He replied, voice high.\n\n\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Sirius murmured.\n\n\nRemus exhaled and closed his eyes, settling back on the pile of cushions. It was like sinking into warm treacle. He let his thoughts drift.\n\n\n\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d He mumbled,\n\n\n\u201cFire away, Moony.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat was Mary on about, this morning?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAbout the Hufflepuff keeper\u2019s stamina? I think she was blagging, to be honest with you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot that,\u201d Remus chuckled, \u201cThe bleeding thing\u2026 bleeding from her\u2026 um\u2026 What did she mean?\u201d\n\n\nSirius swivelled his head in Remus\u2019s lap to look up at him, wearing a bemused frown.\n\n\n\u201cShe was talking about\u2026 you know, her \u2018time of the month\u2019\u2026\u201d He raised his eyebrows, as if Remus was supposed to catch on somehow.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Remus frowned back, none the wiser.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nRe\n\n\nmus\u2026 seriously?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat??\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know! Girls are different from boys\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell I know\n\n\nthat\n\n\n.\u201d Remus bristled, feeling defensive now.\n\n\n\u201cOk, so girls get this thing every month\u2026\u201d Sirius began to explain. Remus was utterly horrified, by the time he\u2019d finished.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the most disgusting thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d He said, flatly.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s natural.\u201d Sirius shrugged, \u201cI\u2019ll get Lily to explain it to you, I probably told it wrong. Bloody hell, you\u2019re nearly eighteen, how did you not\n\n\nknow\n\n\n?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah, make fun of the Care Home kid.\u201d Remus tutted, \u201cI grew up in a boys\u2019 reformatory! How am I supposed to know anything about girls?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExplains a lot.\u201d Sirius said, dryly. Remus flicked his ear, sharply. \u201cOw!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your detention for, anyway?\u201d Remus asked, settling back again.\n\n\n\u201cHexed Crouch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh right.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHim and\n\n\nmy darling brother\n\n\nwere tormenting some second years - but obviously\n\n\nhe\n\n\ngot out of it because\n\n\nhe\u2019s\n\n\na prefect.\u201d Sirius muttered, darkly.\n\n\nHe never said Regulus\u2019s name any more, just \u2018\n\n\nmy darling brother\n\n\n\u2019, in that cruel, overly plummy accent, which Remus thought was probably to make fun of Regulus\u2019s posh-ness. Except (and Remus would never say this out loud) for the first few years Remus had known Sirius, he\u2019d had exactly the same clipped received enunciation.\n\n\n\u201cOught to try and ignore them, if you can.\u201d Remus advised. \u201cI know he bothers you, but it\u2019s better to just stay out of his way. School\u2019s over, soon.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Sirius said, hogging the spliff.\n\n\nRemus reached for it, snatching his wrist. God, he loved Sirius\u2019s wrists. The bones were so fine, the veins like blue ribbon under translucent skin. His own fingers wrapped all the way around easily. He held it now, and pulled Sirius\u2019s hand to his mouth, sucking the end of the joint, then letting him go.\n\n\nSirius just smirked up at him. The record stopped, and he had to get up to flip it to the b-side.\n\n\n\u201cI s\u2019pose I just don\u2019t want him to hurt anyone.\u201d He sighed, settling back down.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not your job.\u201d Remus frowned.\n\n\n\u201cFeels like it.\u201d Sirius muttered, stretching. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what he was like when we were kids. He wasn\u2019t\u2026 he\u2019s not\u2026 I dunno. I just don\u2019t want him to do something he\u2019ll regret, later on.\u201d\n\n\nRemus thought very hard - which was no mean feat, after a few lung fulls of Ravenclaw-grown hash.\n\n\n\u201cTell you something?\u201d He asked.\n\n\n\u201cA secret?\u201d Sirius replied, eagerly, getting up to sit beside him.\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 sort of? But it\u2019s about Regulus. You might not want to hear it.\u201d\n\n\nSirius went a bit quiet; a bit more rigid, but he nodded,\n\n\n\u201cGo on.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemember the boggart that got me and Chris, before Christmas?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow could I forget?\u201d Sirius replied, a note of jealousy in his voice, \u201cWish I\u2019d been there, never seen a boggart.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWerewolves not exciting enough for you now?\u201d Remus raised his eyebrows. \u201cAnyway, er\u2026 I checked the map, right after Chris went to get someone, and\u2026 well I\u2019m pretty sure it was Regulus who put the boggart there. He and Barty were nearby.\u201d\n\n\nRemus craned his neck slightly, so he could see Sirius\u2019s face, and how he was taking the news. His mouth was a straight line. He looked more tired than angry. He shook his head.\n\n\n\u201cStupid prick.\u201d He muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s all\n\n\nher\n\n\n, you know. He\u2019s an idiot for wanting to please her, obviously, but it\u2019s all her fault, anyway.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYour mother?\u201d\n\n\nSirius nodded. Remus didn\u2019t know what to say. They had agreed, long ago - they could talk about anything but mothers. And that\u2019s the way it had been, on Sirius\u2019s side, anyway. Remus didn\u2019t want to go into it now, either. Everything was so nice, and warm, and if they could just hang onto it a bit longer, then this would be such a good memory, something he would have inside him forever.\n\n\nHe reached over and stroked Sirius\u2019s cheek, that perfect,\n\n\nperfect\n\n\njawline. He sat up, and shifted around to face him.\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s forget about all that shit.\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s boring.\u201d\n\n\nSirius kissed him.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n4:00PM\n\n\nRemus walked down alone for dinner at four, as Sirius left for his detention. It was so early that Remus was the only one there, except for Marlene, who was also attending Madam Pomfrey\u2019s healing class.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re coming,\u201d she beamed at him. Marlene smiled a lot these days. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you properly since Christmas!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, sorry!\u201d Remus replied, beginning his second helping of lasagne, twice as big as the first, \u201cBeen so busy with NEWTs stuff\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI really wanted to talk to you about what happened on the train\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh! \u2026 er\u2026\u201d Remus stared at her, fork halfway to his mouth. With all of the fuss about Castor and the full moon, Remus had been able to avoid talking about their strange meeting with Yasmin and Marlene on the train. He felt guilty again. Obviously Marlene had been thinking about it a lot.\n\n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d Marlene was saying, reaching for her wand, \u201c\n\n\nMuffliato\n\n\n!\u201d She murmured.\n\n\nThe noise in the hall around them seemed to deaden, slightly.\n\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d He asked, keeping his voice low.\n\n\n\u201cStops people listening in.\u201d Marlene explained, \u201cLily taught it to us. Mary uses it to gossip all the time in Charms.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Remus nodded, appreciatively.\n\n\n\u201cSo, anyway,\u201d Marlene leaned forward on her elbows, eyes bright, \u201cYou and Sirius! Does anyone know?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Remus finally set down his knife and fork, though he could have happily kept going. \u201cYeah, actually. James and Peter, Lily too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He nodded, checking that there was definitely nobody listening. \u201cOnly recently, though. What about you and Yaz?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo one.\u201d She said, firmly.\n\n\n\u201cNot even Mary?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLeast of all her!\u201d Marlene said, ruefully. Remus decided not to enquire further. He\u2019d had enough revelations concerning Mary for one day.\n\n\n\u201cHas it been going on long? You two?\u201d He asked. \u201cI had no idea\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Marlene blushed, looking down, \u201cI\u2019ve known I was\u2026 different, I suppose, for a long time now, and I really wanted to say something to you, especially after the summer, but\u2026 I dunno, how do you bring it up?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Remus agreed, eagerly.\n\n\n\u201cYaz has been my girlfriend since just before Christmas. She\u2019s incredible.\u201d Marlene was smiling again, and Remus could practically feel the joy radiating from her. He touched her hand, gently,\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy for you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d She squeezed his hand back. \u201cBut what about you?! More to the point, what about\n\n\nSirius\n\n\n?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just flabbergasted, really. Is he fully queer, or more AC-DC?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUm\u2026 you know, I haven\u2019t asked. We don\u2019t really talk about that sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d She gave him an odd, sideways glance. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it bother you? His history with girls?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus felt himself growing hot under the collar. This was exactly the sort of thing he wanted to avoid discussing. With anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s not relevant.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk,\u201d Marlene shrugged, though she looked unconvinced. \u201cIf it works, I suppose.\u201d\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t respond to that, and eventually the\n\n\nMuffliato\n\n\nspell wore off and they finished eating, before making their way to their healing class at 4.30.\n\n\nMarlene was planning to tell Mary, she said, when the time was right. Remus knew that argument well enough, and didn\u2019t think it was really his place to offer advice. It was nice to know that someone else knew how he felt, at least - even just a little bit.\n\n\nThe healing class passed very slowly. Remus found that he was still pretty stoned, plus quite full, which made him sleepy. He tried to listen to Madam Pomfrey\u2019s lecture on circulatory diagnostic spells, but his mind kept wandering, drifting back to his bed, and Sirius. The kindly nurse assumed he was just out of it because the moon was close, and didn\u2019t chastise him as she usually might - he ought to have felt bad about that, but he was too happy daydreaming to worry too much.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n6:30 PM\n\n\nRemus hung back in the hospital wing and sat quietly in Madam Pomfrey\u2019s office while she tidied a few things away, before the pair of them made their journey down to the Shack together. There would only be four more full moons at Hogwarts, after this one, Remus realised. He knew he would miss Poppy Pomfrey more than he could ever tell her. She would always be the first person who had ever tried to make him comfortable; the first person who ever thought they could help.\n\n\nShe bid him goodbye, and promised to return first thing in the morning, as always. He put on the same brave face he\u2019d used when he was eleven, and waved to her cheerily from the bed as she closed the door. Alone, Remus stared at the floor for a bit, trying to recall his afternoon, and suppress the growing dread in the pit of his stomach. He got up and paced a bit, for something to do.\n\n\nIn time, the door creaked open once more, and James poked his head around the corner. He glanced around the room, before entering, looking just as awkward as he had that morning.\n\n\n\u201cHiya, Moony,\u201d he said, pushing his glasses up his nose nervously as he entered, \u201cNo Wormtail yet?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think he had lines to do for McGonagall.\u201d Remus said, sitting on the bed again.\n\n\n\u201cRight-o.\u201d James nodded. He stood leaning against the wall.\n\n\nThey were completely silent for a good three minutes. Remus tried not to fidget, but the quiet was pretty unbearable - he and James had never been awkward before. Even after Remus came out, he was the first to swear that nothing had changed. But of course, now something really\n\n\nhad\n\n\nchanged; something which had shifted and skewed the dynamic. James was generally good at rolling with the punches, but it seemed he had a real blind spot when it came to Sirius Black.\n\n\n\u201cLily wants to be an animagus, now.\u201d James said, suddenly, clearly trying to crack the tension.\n\n\n\u201cOf course she does,\u201d Remus smiled fondly, \u201cBet she masters it in half the time you lot took.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong.\u201d James laughed, appreciatively.\n\n\nBut that only hit a dead end, and silence invaded the space between them once more. Remus swallowed, and watched James, who was looking at his feet. He had just made up his mind to speak - to make some joke, or ask about quidditch, when James looked up, suddenly, catching his eye.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nLook-Moony-I\u2019m-really-sorry-about-this-morning\n\n\n.\u201d He said, all in a rush, as if he\u2019d been holding his breath. Remus blinked.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nYou\u2019re\n\n\nsorry?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I should have realised\u2026 you know, you two are. Um. Together. Going out. Whatever - I shouldn\u2019t have been so surprised\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, Prongs.\u201d Remus said, kindly, \u201c\n\n\nI\u2019m\n\n\nsorry - we\u2019ve been trying not to rub in in your face too much, and I swear nothing was happening this morning, I just sleep there sometimes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSee, that\u2019s what i mean; you shouldn\u2019t have to sneak around!\u201d James burst out, \u201cReally, it\u2019s not a problem! You should sleep where you want to sleep.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 ok, thank you.\u201d Remus nodded.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want things to be weird.\u201d James said, helplessly.\n\n\n\u201cMe neither!\u201d Remus insisted. \u201cThat\u2019s the last thing I want - Sirius too. I just wanted to keep a low profile because\u2026 well he\u2019s your best friend, and him and me seeing each other doesn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI never thought it did!\u201d James said, hurriedly. He had crossed the room now, his inherent good nature taking over as he sat down next to Remus on the bed, \u201cAnd\n\n\nyou\u2019re\n\n\nmy best friend too, Remus.\u201d\n\n\nRemus looked down at his hands, shyly.\n\n\n\u201cChrist, Potter,\u201d he grinned, \u201cWhy\u2019d you always have to be so perfect?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBorn that way.\u201d James shrugged, mirroring Remus\u2019s grin. \u201cCome here, tosser.\u201d He pulled him in for a hug. Remus relaxed, finally. All was well.\n\n\nAt that moment, the door swung open once more, and Sirius sauntered into the room, closely followed by Peter.\n\n\n\u201cOi!\u201d Sirius barked, pointing at James, \u201cHands off my man.\u201d"

            "content": "Howling. Whining. Scents - animals, magic, mould. He had to get out. Hunt. Pack. Pack. The big one tried to stop him. The black one tackled him. But he had to get out. He was so hungry. So hungry...\n\n\n\n\u201cRemus?! Remus?? Wake up!\u201d\n\n\nHis eyes snapped open as Sirius shook him roughly by the shoulders.\n\n\n\u201cWha??\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d\n\n\nHe was lying on his back, on the dusty shack floor. He was bleeding, but he didn\u2019t know where from. Sirius was bleeding too. Remus tried to sit up, and winced as his head rattled and his back creaked.\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d He gasped, throat raw from howling - or screaming.\n\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d Sirius helped him up, and over to the bed. He pulled out a goblet - Remus didn\u2019t know where he\u2019d got it - and whispered, \u201c\n\n\nAuguamenti\n\n\n.\u201d Sirius\u2019s hands were shaking as water poured from his wand, and he handed it to Remus, who drank greedily, spilling it down his front. He knew something was wrong; he could smell the blood and the fear and the sunrise, but it was taking longer than usual for his human thoughts to come back to him; like waking up still drunk with a hangover to boot.\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked again, frowning, \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Sirius shook his head. He looked very pale - not his usual aristocratic alabaster, but sickly, worried, yellowish with sweat. \u201cYou just nipped me a few times - you kept trying to get out.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDid I--?!\u201d Remus grabbed him, suddenly, pulling his shirt. Sirius pushed him down, gently, reaching for blankets to cover him with. He shook his head,\n\n\n\u201cNo, we kept you here. You never left, I promise you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere are the others?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey had to go - Madam Pomfrey\u2019ll be here soon. When you turned back it was different - harder than normal, I think. You wouldn\u2019t wake up properly, so James left me the cloak. I didn\u2019t want to leave you here.\u201d\n\n\nRemus lay back, his mind racing. He tried to remember, but it was all scrambled up. He only knew one thing for sure.\n\n\n\u201cSomething really bad happened.\u201d He whispered. His own voice was trembling now, and cold dread settled in his stomach like a sickness. Sirius didn\u2019t say anything. He just squeezed his hand.\n\n\nHe his under the cloak as soon as Madam Pomfrey arrived, and she hurried in, with a terrible grey look on her own face. He sat up, every muscle screaming at him,\n\n\n\u201cPoppy!\u201d He rasped, \u201cWhat happened? Please tell me!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow are you, first?\u201d She asked, coming over to feel his forehead, \u201cYou\u2019re running very high.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI feel fine,\u201d he lied, batting her hand away impatiently, \u201cThere was an attack, wasn\u2019t there?\u201d\n\n\nShe nodded, wordlessly. His heart thumped, \u201cWho? How many?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She said, very quietly. He had never heard that voice come out of her before. For a moment, she wouldn\u2019t even meet his eyes. She had always looked him in the eye.\n\n\n\u201cPlease.\u201d He said again. She shook her head, very slightly.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can tell you. It\u2019ll be in the morning news.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI have to see Dumbledore!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not here.\u201d She stood up, \u201cNow, can you walk? Professor McGonagall says you\u2019re to go to your lessons as usual, if you\u2019re fit enough? We don\u2019t want anyone asking where you are. I\u2019ll give you something for the pain.\u201d\n\n\nThey walked through the tunnel in silence, with Sirius behind them, still invisible. Madam Pomfrey dealt with the worst of his scratches - mostly from Padfoot, though fortunately she assumed he\u2019d done them to himself - and told him to carry on about his day. He took the potion she gave him, but his head still throbbed and his body ached. As soon as she had turned a corner, Sirius revealed himself, and slid an arm around Remus\u2019s back.\n\n\n\u201cWhy are you pretending you\u2019re ok?\u201d He hissed, supporting Remus up the stairs back to their dorm, \u201cYou can barely walk!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine in a minute.\u201d Remus replied, gritting his teeth, \u201cShe\u2019s got enough to worry about. Ugh, fucking stairs.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJames said he\u2019d send an owl to his dad right away,\u201d Sirius said, as they slowly traversed the marble staircase, \u201cIf anyone knows what\u2019s happened, the Potters will.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus nodded, wheezing, \u201cGood\u2026\u201d But he knew that it was all no good. Whatever had happened, had happened, and it had been just as awful as Castor promised. It was the end of any chance of civility for the werewolves.\n\n\nBack in the dorm room, James was still waiting for a reply from his parents. Remus sat down on his bed, heavily, chest heaving, every part of him aching, his skin on fire.\n\n\n\u201cYou could just bunk off,\u201d Sirius said, awkwardly, glancing at the others, \u201cWe do it all the time.\u201d\n\n\nRemus shook his head. He hauled himself up, clutching the bed frame.\n\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t risk it. We\u2019ve got Arithmancy first, Snape\u2019s in that - if the papers are full of werewolf attacks and I\u2019m not there, what d\u2019you want to bet he\u2019ll be the first to start stirring? I\u2019m going for a shower, just a minute.\u201d\n\n\nHe could hear the other three marauders whispering loudly through the bathroom door, but he hadn\u2019t the energy to focus on anything except getting through the next six hours. He turned on the taps and let the hissing water drown them out.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nWEREWOLF ATTACKS - MAGICAL COMMUNITY DEMANDS ACTION!\n\n\n\nHundreds were affected by a string of brutal werewolf attacks during last nights full moon which left fifteen wizards dead and at least five missing - presumed kidnapped. None of the creatures responsible have been identified as yet, and the Auror\u2019s office has advised everyone to be on high alert, and to consult the published ministry guidelines on identifying and approaching werewolves, which are classified XXXXX and considered highly dangerous.\n\n\n\n\nThe interim minister for magic has been criticised for failure to maintain the Werewolf Register, established by Newt Scamander in 1947. Speaking for the opposition, Abraxas Malfoy released a statement in the early hours of this morning:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLast night\u2019s attacks are further proof that the ministry is in dire need of reform, and on behalf of the ancient and law abiding magical families of Great Britain we demand stricter sanctions on half humans and other undesirable and potentially dangerous elements.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThis statement has provoked outrage in what insiders are describing as an increasingly divided ministry\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo names.\u201d James muttered darkly. \u201cThat\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cProtecting the victims\u2019 families?\u201d Sirius suggested.\n\n\n\u201cSince when has the Daily Prophet cared about that?\u201d Lily hissed, venomously. \u201cSince when has the ministry?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCareful what you say!\u201d Peter whispered, his eyes wide, \u201cMy cousin who works at the\n\n\nProphet\n\n\nsaid they\u2019re being sent really strict guidelines on what they can write - about the ministry, the war, anything - and there are spies everywhere checking on them, making sure no one\u2019s being too critical.\u201d\n\n\nThis made everyone go quiet, and Lily looked around nervously, glancing over her shoulder. It didn\u2019t matter; everyone in the Great Hall seemed to be talking about the same thing, huddled in groups over newspapers, whispering amongst themselves.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if we\u2019re disagreeing with what the paper says,\u201d Marlene whispered, leaning forward, \u201cI hate Malfoy\u2019s politics as much as the next half-blood, but he\u2019s right about the failures of the register. The werewolves need to be contained, or stuff like this will happen, dark lord or not!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d Sirius scoffed, \u201cAn organised attack like this only happens when there\u2019s someone behind it, this would never happen without Voldemort goading them.\u201d\n\n\nEveryone winced as he said the name. Remus had noticed that happening more and more, as the list of missing grew and people trusted each other less.\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still dangerous.\u201d Marlene replied. \u201cI don\u2019t see why we\u2019re pretending they aren\u2019t - it says right here,\u201d she jabbed the black and white print, \u201cClassified XXXXX. I know it\u2019s unfortunate for them, they might have been perfectly normal otherwise, but facts are facts.\u201d\n\n\nNo one said anything to that.\n\n\nRemus doing his best to ignore all of them. He was busy writing a letter to Professor Ferox, who was the only person he could think of who had been in potential danger last night. Livia knew him; he had attacked her once, and Remus thought she seemed like the sort of person to hold a grudge. Besides, writing gave him something to distract himself from how dreadful he felt; aching and shivery all over. He knew he looked awful too, and thought it best to keep his head down.\n\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about.\u201d Lily whispered to him, on their way out of the Hall. \u201cMarls just sees everything as black and white. Don\u2019t take it personally,\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Remus replied, tiredly, \u201cI\u2019m fine, don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d\n\n\nStill, he was dreading Care of Magical Creatures later that morning, when he\u2019d have to sit next to Marlene. He\u2019d cast a glamour to cover up his newer scars, and was sipping on a\n\n\nPepper Up\n\n\npotion as if it was keeping him alive, but he couldn\u2019t hide the fact that he was utterly exhausted. Not to mention the bone crushing guilt he felt over the attacks. He\u2019d\n\n\nknown\n\n\nthey were going to happen. He\u2019d told Dumbledore, but it hadn\u2019t been enough, he ought to have done more.\n\n\nArithmancy wasn\u2019t too bad; he had Sirius, James and Lily in that, and they formed a protective huddle around him, taking their seats at the back of the class. The exercises were almost impossible to do, Remus found his mind oddly fractured; unable to hold down a thought for very long. James and Sirius fell into their usual clownish mischief, creating a satisfactory distraction any time the teacher glanced up at Remus. He was so grateful, especially as they had both been up all night too.\n\n\nAfterwards, Sirius walked him to Care of Magical Creatures, as he had a free hour, and Remus hadn\u2019t the energy to refuse. The hallways were too busy for him to risk leaning on the other boy for support, so they just went slowly.\n\n\n\u201cJust bunk off?\u201d Sirius pleaded, watching him struggle down the third flight of stairs, \u201cYou\u2019ve shown your face, Snivellus has seen you\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus just shook his head, carrying on doggedly. As he reached the bottom, a couple of third year boys rushed past, shouting at each other and laughing. One of them bumped into Remus with his bag, which would have been nothing on a good day, but at that moment was exactly the wrong thing, and knocked Remus sideways into the bannister. He bit his lip as the left side of his body hit the hard stone, but couldn\u2019t help letting out a gasp of pain.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nSyrtis-corpius!\n\n\n\u201d Sirius yelled, pulling his wand out and firing the hex at all three boys. They yelped as the marble staircases turned to quicksand beneath them, and began to swallow them up. Sirius only stopped it when their legs were dangling through the bottom and they were both trapped halfway. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going!\u201d He said, menacingly, before helping Remus down the last few steps.\n\n\nNo one intervened - no one ever did when it was Sirius - and Remus was too focussed on getting to his lesson on time.\n\n\n\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll go back and free them?\u201d He asked, as they neared the classroom, \u201cI don\u2019t need you getting a detention on top of everything\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf someone else hasn\u2019t found them,\u201d Sirius shrugged. \u201cI only taught them a lesson, any prefect would have done the same.\u201d\n\n\nRemus usually would have found that funny, but he felt as though\n\n\nhe\n\n\nwas wading through quicksand too, his limbs heavy and slow, everything around him foggy and blurred. \u201cRight,\u201d Sirius was saying, \u201cI\u2019ll be back here in an hour to get you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need collecting, I\u2019m not a child.\u201d Remus muttered.\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sirius squeezed his hand, very quickly, \u201cYou\u2019re my Moony.\u201d\n\n\nHe made a mental note to save that up for later, when he was alone, and could bask in the thought of being Sirius\u2019s anything. Just now he hated himself too much to allow anyone to be kind.\n\n\nCare of Magical Creatures was worse than he could have imagined. His temperature was running even higher from the exertion, and he had to keep wiping sweat from his eyes, hair sticking to his forehead. Despite breakfast having been only an hour earlier, his stomach felt like an empty cavern, growling intermittently. His head ached and his vision swam, but he sat bolt upright, staring fixedly at the blackboard.\n\n\nThey were supposed to be doing dragons - identifying the various species and their individual properties. Kettleburn began the lesson as he always did, with a terrifying and usually harrowing story of an encounter he\u2019d had with whichever creature they were discussing. Today was no different, and the battle-scarred professor was in his element today - he had lost two limbs to dragons.\n\n\nDespite this animated tale, only half of the class was actually paying attention (you could tell by the look of faint horror on their faces as they scribbled down notes). The other half - Marlene and Mary included - was busy reading the chapter in their textbooks which concerned werewolves.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something a bit sexy about the whole beast-man thing, though,\u201d Mary whispered across Remus, who began to feel light-headed.\n\n\n\u201cMary!\u201d Marlene hissed, angrily, \u201cThat\u2019s completely insensitive, people\n\n\ndied\n\n\n!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t think that, anyway, if you met a real one! I spoke to Sian Bolsh over the summer; she left last year for healer training, and she\u2019s been shadowing a healer on the lycanthropy ward at St. Mungo\u2019s. They have awful hygiene, most of them, because they can\u2019t live near normal wizards, and they basically live off hand-outs and charity--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell then I feel sorry for them!\u201d Mary snapped back, \u201cThat sounds horrible, wizards are so heartless.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re being deliberately dense! They\u2019re not\n\n\nsafe\n\n\n--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me, Professor Kettleburn,\u201d the whole class turned to see McGonagall standing in the doorway. Remus\u2019s stomach dropped - had she come for him? Had the\n\n\nministry\n\n\nfinally come for him?!\n\n\nThe head of Gryffindor house looked very grave, and was holding a letter in her hand, but she did not look at Remus. \u201cI am sorry to interrupt. Marlene McKinnon, may I speak to you?\u201d\n\n\nMarlene frowned and stood up, setting her quill back into the inkwell. She threw a confused glance back at Mary and Remus before following Professor McGonagall out of the room. The door closed and everyone stared at it in silence.\n\n\n\u201cShe can\u2019t be in trouble,\u201d Mary whispered to Remus, \u201cShe\u2019s too goody-goody.\u201d\n\n\nRemus mumbled something, but his hunger had turned into queasiness and he didn\u2019t want to open his mouth. He wished he could take off his cloak, the room was so stuffy and hot; he was getting uncomfortably damp under his armpits and across his back. \u201cAre you all right, sweetheart?\u201d Mary asked, her face concerned. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re going to puke, is it Kettleburn\u2019s horrid stories?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMmmph.\u201d Remus nodded very slightly, shooting pains firsting up his neck as he did so. He rested his forehead in his hands, hoping he just looked like he was really interested in his notes.\n\n\nThere was no room for Mary to probe him anymore, though. A horrible shriek sounded outside the classroom, followed by a chilling moan of absolute despair. Mary was on her feet at once, and flew out of the room to see her friend. Remus caught only a glimpse as the door swung open and shut, of Marlene on her knees, sobbing, and McGonagall bent over her, patting her shoulders.\n\n\nEven Kettleburn was rendered mute for a few minutes, before regaining his composure, and clearing his throat.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in difficult times,\u201d he said, quite out of character, \u201cI urge you all to be kind to each other, especially as you prepare to leave Hogwarts.\u201d\n\n\nThe lesson continued after that, much subdued, and it took all of Remus\u2019s concentration to stay conscious in his seat, now that he was alone on his desk. About fifteen minutes before the class was due to end, there was a second knock at the door.\n\n\n\u201cEnter!\u201d Kettleburn barked. The door opened, and Lily walked in,\n\n\n\u201cGood morning, professor, I\u2019ve just come to collect Marlene\u2019s things for her.\u201d\n\n\nKettleburn nodded and gestured at Marlene\u2019s desk, where her work was still spread out, her book bag hanging off the back of her chair. Lily went over and quickly started gathering things together. She took one look at Remus and raised her head, \u201cSorry, professor - could I ask Remus to come with me? I didn\u2019t realise Mary left all of her bits too\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d Kettleburn nodded, distractedly, labelling a diagram of a dragon\u2019s lair on the board. \u201cChapters eighteen to twenty five for next lesson, please, Mr Lupin.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes sir,\u201d Remus croaked, picking up Mary\u2019s bag. Thank god it wasn\u2019t heavy. And thank god for Lily Evans.\n\n\nAs soon as they were outside in the corridor, Remus leaned heavily against the wall and closed his eyes.\n\n\n\u201cOh, Remus,\u201d Lily said, anxiously, raising a cool hand to his forehead, \u201cYou look dreadful!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He mumbled, uselessly, eyes still shut, \u201cJust give me a second\u2026 is Marlene\u2026?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s gone home.\u201d Lily lowered her voice, though they were quite alone, \u201cHer brother, Danny, was attacked last night. St. Mungo\u2019s started realising names.\u201d\n\n\nRemus\u2019s head swam; he opened his eyes only to see black spots, and closed them again, in case he fainted,\n\n\n\u201cIs he\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s alive. But\u2026 it doesn\u2019t sound very good.\u201d\n\n\nThe guilt was overwhelming, roaring in Remus\u2019s ears. How would he ever look Marlene in the eye again? \u201cCome on,\u201d Lily took his arm and draped it over her shoulders. She fitted very snugly, but he didn\u2019t dare lean on her too much, \u201cI\u2019m taking you to the tower, you\u2019re in no state for school. I\u2019ll say you\u2019re helping me pack for Marlene.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSomeone ought to tell--\u201d He was about to say Yasmin, but realised that it was still a secret. \u201c...Madam Pomfrey.\u201d He finished, lamely, \u201cMarlene\u2019s going to miss healing lessons.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she already knows,\u201d Lily replied, briskly, \u201cCome along, now.\u201d\n\n\nShe was a lot harder to refuse than Sirius."

Remus finally crawled out of the covers. \u201cI do want you here, I just don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\nHe could hear Sirius fidgeting, his hands in his pockets, then running through his hair. Finally,\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk?\u201d\nRemus sighed. He was a mess; he hadn\u2019t washed properly since Wednesday, and had only got out of bed to use the bathroom. The other boys had been feeding him by passing food through the crack in his curtains, and if they hadn\u2019t Remus wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d have eaten at all. He was in the worst state he\u2019d ever been in. But he missed Sirius.\n\u201c...ok then.\u201d\nThe curtains parted and Remus scowled against the bright daylight, but Sirius crawled in quickly, closing them again. He looked at Remus, but he didn\u2019t look too hard before shuffling down next to him and enveloping him in his arms.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he breathed against Remus\u2019s hair, \u201cfor letting me in.\u201d\n\u201cReckon I must stink.\u201d\nSirius inhaled deeply, tickling Remus\u2019s forehead and making him squirm.\n\u201cNope, just smell like Moony.\u201d\n\u201cGerroff, mutt.\u201d Remus wriggled away from him.\n\u201cFeel like getting up soon? Everyone\u2019s worried. And they\u2019re looking at\nme\nnow, like\nI\nknow what to do, because everyone knows about us, which is weird, and quite a lot of pressure, really.\u201d\nRemus chuckled, and it felt strange, but good. Still, he had a melancholic episode to maintain.\n\u201cI still don\u2019t feel like getting up.\u201d\n\u201cOk, then you need to let me hide here with you, because I\u2019m not going back out there.\u201d\n\u201c\nSirius.\u201d\n\u201cRe\nmus.\u201d Sirius frowned at him, exaggerating his eyebrows to look stupid.\n\u201cStop it.\u201d Remus folded his arms, aware he was starting to sound like a sulky child.\n\u201cI will not.\u201d Sirius poked him in the ribs, \u201cCome on, I know you\u2019re feeling like shit about everything, but did you ever consider that it's not for\nyou\nto hog all of the misery like this? That maybe if you talk to your friends it might not all seem quite so bleak?\u201d\nRemus frowned up at him, arms still crossed.\n\u201cMaybe that works for you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAre you saying this is working for you?\u201d\nRemus pressed his lips together. They stared each other out for a minute. Remus began to think he\u2019d quite like to fight Sirius right now, like they did on full moons; just because it was a fun way to expel energy. Then he noticed something. He sniffed the air.\n\u201cAre you bleeding? I can smell blood.\u201d\n\u201cProbably you, from the moon.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve healed already, I never have open wounds longer than a day.\u201d\n\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Sirius laughed, lightly, \u201cHow is it possible for you to get\nany\ncooler?!\u201d\n\u201cAnd it's your blood, I can tell.\u201d\n\u201cThere you go again! You\u2019re basically a superhero.\u201d\n\u201c\nSirius!\u201d\n\u201cOk, ok,\u201d he sat up, running his hands through his hair. \u201cYou swiped at me a few times over the moon, I told you that, we did it to each other. And you can\u2019t turn me when I\u2019m a dog, we\u2019ve tested that enough times.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re still bleeding?! It was almost a week ago! You need to go to Madam Pomfrey!\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, and say my werewolf boyfriend scratched me while I was in dog form as an illegal animagus?!\u201d\n\u201cJesus.\u201d Remus groaned, hauling himself up and out of bed, grabbing Sirius by the wrist and pulling him along.\n\u201cWhere are we going?!\u201d\n\u201cI need better light!\u201d\nHe yanked open the bathroom door and slammed down the lid of the toilet. \u201cSit.\u201d He instructed. Sirius complied, half smiling.\nRemus opened the little mirror cabinet above the sink, digging out murtlap essence and disinfectant and gauze and cotton balls. (He had found over years of trial and error that a combination of magical and muggle things worked best. As with almost everything else.) He pulled his wand out of his pyjama bottoms and stood in front of Sirius.\n\u201cOk. Show me.\u201d\nSirius dropped his head, no longer enjoying Remus\u2019s newfound motivation. He sighed heavily and lifted his shirt, saying,\n\u201cIt's not that\nbad\u2026\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t as bad as Remus had feared, but it still made his stomach clench when he saw. Three dark red stripes, across Sirius\u2019s ribs. They were starting to heal, but he knew he could fix it fairly easily. He took a deep breath, met Sirius\u2019s eye, and then reached for the disinfectant. Then his wand. Remus was pretty good at healing cuts now, and the scab and the redness were gone in an instant. Now they were white stripes.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said, mournfully. \u201cIt was a magical wound. You\u2019ll have a scar there for the rest of your life, now.\u201d\nSirius looked down at the mark, then up again.\n\u201cThat's fine, Remus.\u201d He said, quietly.\n* * *\nSo, Remus rejoined the group, at Sirius\u2019s goading, and they were all kind enough to pretend he had merely been unwell, and not avoiding them. The news over the past few days had been particularly grim. First the\nProphet\nhad published a list of the dead, and their photographs. Then they had published a list of those \u2018presumed bitten\u2019, along with\ntheir\nphotographs, which had provoked outcry among some of the more liberal commentators, and ignited a debate on mandatory registration for all werewolves.\nGreyback\u2019s name had not been mentioned, nor any other werewolf that Remus was aware of. It was as if the horrific crimes simply happened one night, and the assailants had vanished into thin air. No one had heard from Marlene, either, though Danny McKinnon was one of those named in the papers.\nHe\u2019d been given a full four inches of text, by virtue of his celebrity as beater for the Chudley Cannons. The team\u2019s manager was interviewed and quoted saying that while he had not yet been briefed on the details Danny\u2019s condition, the Cannons operated a \u2018zero-tolerance\u2019 policy to \u2018half-breeds and dangerous creatures\u2019, and would deal with any allegations of infection accordingly. James vowed that he would never see a Chudley Cannons game again, but Remus mostly felt sorry for Danny.\nThey tried to put all of this misery behind them, and went down for Sunday lunch (and thank goodness; it was generally Remus\u2019s favourite meal of the week, and he\u2019d have been even more blue if he\u2019d missed it), then spent the rest of the evening cosied up in the common room in front of the fire. Remus even acquiesced to a chess game with Peter, who was thrilled.\n\u201cYou know what we ought to start getting serious about,\u201d Sirius mused, sorting through his record collection.\n\u201cNEWTs?\u201d Remus asked, hopefully, as Peter captured his knight.\n\u201cJob applications?\u201d Lily said, from the arm chair, where she sat in James\u2019s lap, reading a magazine.\n\u201cThe quidditch cup?\u201d James suggested.\n\u201cFor goodness sake,\u201d Sirius tiutted, \u201cI\u2019m ashamed to call you all marauders.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d All three of them frowned, offended. Peter chuckled,\n\u201cHe\u2019s talking about the big prank on Slytherin. You know, we started planning it before christmas.\u201d\n\u201cWormy-boy, you are without a doubt my very favourite person.\u201d Sirius grinned broadly. Peter snorted,\n\u201cBugger off,\u201d and promptly captured Remus\u2019s queen.\n\u201cUgh. I don\u2019t know why I bother, haven\u2019t beaten you since I was thirteen.\u201d Remus sighed, leaning back on the rug on his elbows. He looked up at Sirius, \u201cWell then? Got a plan?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. Whatever we do, I think we should focus the attack on the dungeons.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s not throw around words like \u2018attack\u2019,\u201d Lily said, hurriedly, \u201cThis is just a practical joke, right? In the wholesome spirit of harmless house rivalry?\u201d\n\u201cIf you like,\u201d Sirius shrugged, half ignoring the interjection. \u201cAnyway, Moony, I thought your study group was in on this? What\u2019s the point in you having all these minions if you can\u2019t make them work for you?\u201d\n\u201cOh my god, for the last time, they are not my \u2018minions\u2019!\u201d Remus rolled his eyes. \u201cAnyway, we\u2019ve not had a proper study group yet this term. I\u2019ve been ever so slightly busy.\u201d\n\u201cWell, as none of us are scheduled to be in mortal peril for the next month or so,\u201d Sirius replied, \u201cI think we ought to get cracking. Everyone could do with a laugh, eh? Assemble the troops, we\u2019ll meet sometime next week.\u201d\n\u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t clash with quidditch,\u201d James yawned, \u201cI\u2019m there. Right, I\u2019m off to bed, Transfiguration first thing.\u201d\nThe others all glanced up at the clock, or began to yawn themselves and agreed to follow suit. The common room was clearing out now, anyway, and they were some of the last to leave.\nRemus had just got his pyjamas on and brushed his teeth, when he remembered that he\u2019d left his book downstairs. While that didn\u2019t usually matter, this particular book was\nMaurice\n, by E.M. Forster, and though the cover was nondescript, he was a bit concerned that if someone picked it up and read the blurb there would be raised eyebrows.\nSighing, he left the bathroom and hurried downstairs, muttering, \u201cGetting my book.\u201d to Sirius, who was next in the queue.\nHe had just grabbed the book and was about to head back up, when he heard the portrait hole slide open. He turned to see Mary enter. She was wearing a short, spangly silver dress, and she tripped on her way in, but caught herself and giggled.\n\u201cAll right?\u201d He called to her.\nShe looked up, squinting a bit in the dim light.\n\u201cHiya, sexy,\u201d she grinned, wandering in a bit unsteady on her feet. Might have been the four inch heels she was wearing. Or it might have been the Witches Brew Remus could smell wafting off her.\n\u201cHello, been somewhere?\u201d He walked back towards the couches, wanting to make sure she was all right before leaving.\n\u201cPfffff.\u201d She waved a hand, collapsing into the nearest armchair, spreading her legs out. Her short dress rode up her thighs, but she didn\u2019t seem bothered, \u201cJust a few drinks in the Ravenclaw common room.\u201d\n\u201cThought you were seeing a Hufflepuff?\u201d\n\u201cMm, he was there.\u201d She exhaled, smiling, tilted her head back and closed her eyes. The lids were painted gold, finely rimmed with kohl. She looked like an Egyptian queen in a party frock. \u201cBut a\nlot\nof people were there, I s\u2019pose.\u201d\nShe sounded sad. Remus sat down in the armchair opposite her, clutching the book in his lap.\n\u201cAre you ok, Mary?\u201d\n\u201cOh. Fine.\u201d She opened her eyes, slowly, and smiled at him. She wasn\u2019t that drunk, he realised, but she looked tired, and deeply unhappy. \u201cJust stuff on my mind. Boys being wankers. Poor Marlene.\u201d\n\u201cHave you heard from her?\u201d\nMary shook her head, then sat up, blinking.\n\u201cHaven\u2019t got a fag, have you sweetheart? I don\u2019t usually, but I just really fancy one.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus reached in his pockets for his matchbox, where he kept the cigarettes he had rolled himself. He slid it open, \u201cNormal or fun?\u201d\n\u201cOooh, fun, please,\u201d she purred, reaching over, \u201cMight help me sleep.\u201d\n\u201cUm, about Marlene,\u201d Remus said, lighting his own, \u201cI just had a thought, er\u2026 you know her friend Yaz? Have you seen her about? I wasn\u2019t sure if anyone told her--\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d Mary said, exhaling, watching Remus through the smoke beneath her heavy golden eyelids. \u201cI told her.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Remus blinked, surprised. \u201cThat\u2019s good, then.\u201d\n\u201cMmm, I thought she had better know,\u201d Mary mused, pulling a strand of her hair and winding it coyly around her little finger. \u201cDidn\u2019t want her to think Marls had gone cold on her.\u201d\nRemus took a quick, sharp puff on his cigarette, frowning very slightly.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nMary laughed, arching back in the chair, showing her pearly white teeth. She let the curl of hair spring back into place like a corkscrew.\n\u201cOh come on, Remus,\u201d she shook her head, \u201cI\nknow.\n\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026 she told you?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mary conceded, settling back down with a sigh, \u201cBut I\u2019m not thick, despite rumours to the contrary. At least, I know what\nromance\nlooks like.\u201d She arched her eyebrow, \u201cI\u2019m not as dense as James, for example. How long did he take to figure it out?\u201d\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know about Marlene,\u201d Remus replied, \u201cThey must keep it quiet during quidditch stuff.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about Marlene, now. I\u2019m talking about you.\u201d\n\u201cMe?!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good kisser, isn\u2019t he?\u201d She winked at him. \u201cBut then, you were too, I seem to remember.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2026?!\u201d\n\u201cMm, I\u2019ve suspected for a little while now. Just little things. All the time you spend together. His being single for more than five minutes. I wasn\u2019t a hundred percent sure, but you\u2019ve just confirmed it for me.\u201d\n\u201cBugger.\u201d\nShe laughed again, a friendly, trilling sound.\n\u201cSilly boy.\u201d She smiled affectionately, playing with her hair again as she smoked. She looked at him again, her eyes more focussed. When she spoke, her voice was more serious than normal. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you want to keep it quiet. I was going to wait, to see if you told me yourself - like I\u2019m doing with Marls. But. I just wanted to let you know\u2026 I know I\u2019ve got this reputation for being a bit of a big mouth, but I\ncan\nkeep a secret, ok? Especially for my friends. And if\u2026\u201d She bit her lip, \u201cIf there\u2019s anything else you\u2019re keeping secret, Remus, then you can trust me, ok? It doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d\nThis was almost too many revelations for one evening. Remus sucked hard on his cigarette, and half wished he\u2019d opted for a spliff too.\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d He asked, very carefully. \u201cDo you think you know something\u2026 else?\u201d\n\u201cRemus.\u201d She sat up. \u201cThe scars? Being ill every full moon? We do the same Care of Magical Creatures class.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d Remus said, his voice very low, even though they were completely alone. \u201cPlease, Mary\u2026 me and Sirius, that\u2019s one thing, but\nthis\u2026\nI could get kicked out of school. I could get arrested!\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d Mary stood up, quickly, and came over to sit on the arm of the chair, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell! That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to explain.\u201d She wound an arm around his shoulder. \u201cMakes no difference to me, I swear.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cHonestly.\u201d She kissed his cheek and gave him a squeeze. \u201cSo don\u2019t take what happened to Marlene\u2019s brother so hard, eh? It was nothing to do with you.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019d never forgive me, if she knew\u2026\u201d Remus said, sadly. Mary handed him what was left of the joint and he puffed on it gratefully.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that,\u201d She said, flippantly, \u201cShe\u2019ll come around. She knows who you really are. And maybe you could help? You could write to Danny, even - I bet he could do with a friend.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s--\u201d Remus was about to say that while it was a really nice idea, it was almost impossible, considering the fact that he was unregistered, and it would be a bad idea to draw attention to himself.\n\u201cMooony, where are you?\u201d Sirius\u2019s plaintive voice came clattering down the stairs, \u201cI can smell the pot all the way from here, you\u2019re not being subtle-- oh! Hiya MacDonald.\u201d\n\u201cBlack,\u201d Mary nodded, still perched on the arm of Remus\u2019s chair, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m trying to seduce your boyfriend.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, I\u2019d like to see you -- wait, my\nwhat\n?!\u201d\nShe just poked out her tongue at him. He looked at Remus, \u201cAre we just telling everyone, now?!\u201d\n\u201cOi!\u201d Mary hopped off the seat, \u201cI\u2019m not \u2018everyone\u2019! Arrogant tosser. Don\u2019t forget I had you both first.\u201d\nRemus couldn\u2019t help laughing at the look on Sirius\u2019s face, and got out of the chair, sheepishly, still clutching\nMaurice\n,\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019ll come up now, we were just chatting.\u201d He looked back at Mary, \u201cWill you be ok?\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d She nodded, smiling, \u201cI\u2019m off to bed too. Night lads!\u201d\n\u201cGood night!\u201d\nBack upstairs in the warm glow of their dorm room, Peter was already snoring softly behind his curtains, and James was sitting cross legged on his bed, flipping through his quidditch notebook.\n\u201cThought we\u2019d lost you, Moony,\u201d he whispered, cheerily, as the two boys entered.\n\u201cBumped into Mary, she\u2019s been at some party with the Ravenclaws.\u201d\n\u201cSee, this is what happens when you get stuck with the Head Boy\nand\nthe Head Girl in your house,\u201d Sirius sighed, leaning back on his own bed, \u201cAll the fun happens elsewhere.\u201d\n\u201cOh, stop whinging,\u201d James grinned, closing his book, \u201cWe\u2019ll have more parties and you know it. Now go to bed like a good boy.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Sirius yawned, falling backwards dramatically, so that he disappeared through the heavy velvet hangings.\n\u201cG\u2019night then,\u201d Remus started, making for his own bed, but Sirius\u2019s hand shot out and grabbed his wrist.\n\u201cMoony\u2026\u201d he whispered, softly, from the shadows behind the veil. Remus bit his lip and glanced over at James, who looked away, awkwardly, and began to draw his own bed curtains across. Oh well. Fuck it.\n\u201cMmm\u2026 ok\u2026\u201d Remus let Sirius pull him inside."

We\u2019re the only boys you know, and we\u2019re doing this.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTouch\u00e8.\u201d Lily poked her tongue out at him from where she sat cross legged on James\u2019s bed.\n\n\n\u201cAnd,\u201d James said, sitting on the floor beside Remus, folding envelopes as fast as Remus could stuff them, \u201cHow do you know I haven\u2019t\n\n\nalready\n\n\nplanned something nice?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhen do you have the time?\u201d She shrugged, \u201cWhenever you\u2019re not with me you\u2019re playing quidditch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can multi-task,\u201d he said, haughtily, a mischievous twinkle in his eye.\n\n\nRemus gave James a sideways glance. He couldn\u2019t account for any of James\u2019s free time either, but it was best never to underestimate James Potter.\n\n\n\u201cHow about you, Pete?\u201d Mary asked, sitting on James\u2019s other side, neatly stacking the envelopes he handed her and ticking names off the list, \u201cBig plans for tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNope.\u201d Peter replied, glumly. He was lying on his stomach on his bed, frantically completing the Charms notes due for the next day. He\u2019d dropped a few hints to Remus about copying them, but Remus had pretended not to understand and eventually poor Wormtail had dropped it and just resigned himself to doing a poor job.\n\n\n\u201cWhat about Dorcas?\u201d Mary pressed.\n\n\n\u201cDumped me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAw, poor love.\u201d She cooed, \u201cAt least I won\u2019t be the only single one.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Pete looked up, hopefully.\n\n\n\u201cYep, dumped that stupid Hufflepuff.\u201d Mary nodded, bent over her work.\n\n\n\u201cOh well, if you fancied dinner, maybe\u2026\u201d Peter started. Mary shook her head,\n\n\n\u201cOh no, sorry Pete, I\u2019m triple booked as it is; it\u2019ll be a miracle if none of them bump into each other.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Peter returned to his homework, looking even more depressed than before. Lily stifled a giggle, but Mary seemed oblivious.\n\n\n\u201cCheer up Pete, we still love you.\u201d Remus offered, stuffing his very last envelope and handing it to James. \u201cMe and Padfoot\u2019ll have dinner with you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo basically exactly the same as every other night of the year.\u201d Sirius teased.\n\n\n\u201cYou two not doing anything, then?\u201d Mary asked, casually. It felt like a loaded question, all the same, and Remus found it hard to ignore the glances his friends were now shooting at each other. He looked up at Sirius and said, very firmly,\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d\n\n\nSirius\u2019s face cracked into a smile,\n\n\n\u201cI think Valentine\u2019s Day is Moony\u2019s idea of hell.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Remus nodded, solemnly. Let the girls have flowers and hearts. He had plenty else going on, thank you very much.\n\n\n\u201cAww, I think that\u2019s a shame,\u201d Mary said, crossing the last name off her list and stretching her legs out on the rug, lying back on her elbows. \u201cValentine\u2019s Day can be nice, if you do it right.\u201d\n\n\nRemus smirked at her. \u2018Doing it right\u2019 to Mary meant receiving votive offerings from her various acolytes; a fantasy in which she was Aphrodite, and all would pay homage.\n\n\n\u201cNope, not interested.\u201d He said, stretching his own stiff legs. \u201cJust a normal day.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nSirius\n\n\nlikes it.\u201d Mary said, slyly, \u201cHe was always dead romantic.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhen we weren\u2019t fighting.\u201d Sirius interjected. Remus looked at him, and realised he had never actually considered whether or not the other boy was interested in celebrating the day. He\u2019d just assumed they were on the same page.\n\n\n\u201cAnyway, that was different.\u201d Peter mused, sucking the nib of his quill and getting ink on his lip.\n\n\n\u201cWhat was?\u201d Mary asked.\n\n\n\u201cWhen Padfoot was going out with you.\u201d Peter replied. \u201cObviously he did all the mushy stuff then.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cObviously?\u201d Lily spoke up. Remus cringed. he could see where this was going. the redhead had her hackles up; it didn\u2019t happen often, but when it did it always ended in a scolding. \u201cWhat do you mean, Peter?\u201d\n\n\nPeter saw it coming too, but bless him, he tried to explain himself.\n\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t being nasty,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 well it\u2019s not the same thing, is it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes it is!\u201d Mary frowned.\n\n\nJames was clearly annoyed too. Remus sighed, inwardly. He looked up at Sirius, who shrugged at him. Remus held out his hand, and Sirius hopped off the bed to take it, pulling Remus to his feet. Remus cleared his throat.\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve all finished discussing our relationship amongst yourselves?\u201d\n\n\nThey all looked up, sheepishly.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, Moony,\n\n\n\u201cSorry Remus.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s move on, shall we?\u201d Remus raised an eyebrow, and leaned against his bed post with his hands in his pockets. He nodded at the pile of sealed envelopes, \u201cWe need to pass those around tomorrow, as soon as. I think probably best to do it at breakfast, so it gets mixed in with the regular post and doesn\u2019t look suspicious.\u201d\n\n\nThis was met with a murmur of general agreement.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget, the ink only becomes legible when the right person gives their name.\u201d Remus continued. He went over to his bedside table for his matchbox of cigarettes and slid one out.\n\n\n\u201cThat was such a good idea, I can\u2019t believe you did it so quickly.\u201d Mary said. She didn\u2019t know that the spell they\u2019d used was exactly the same as the one on the Marauder\u2019s Map, and they weren\u2019t going to tell her.\n\n\n\u201cYou are in the presence of greatness, MacDonald.\u201d Sirius said, taking Remus\u2019s cigarette the second he\u2019d lit it. Remus sighed and pulled out another.\n\n\n\u201cAt least open a window if you have to smoke in here,\u201d James sighed.\n\n\n\u201cWe have to smoke in here,\u201d Sirius said, flicking his wand at the windows so that they flung wide open. \u201cBecause our poxy Head Boy banned smoking in the common room.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAll the prefects voted on that, actually.\u201d Lily said, wryly.\n\n\n\u201cSee, Moony,\u201d Sirius nudged him with his hip, \u201cThis is why you should have stayed a prefect, you could have been the voice of dissent.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTruly tragic.\u201d Remus exhaled smoke.\n\n\n\u201cRight, I\u2019m off to bed, then.\u201d Mary said, getting up, lifting the pile of invitations and setting them down on James\u2019s trunk. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to this, be nice to have something else to think about.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d Lily said, getting up too.\n\n\n\u201cShall I walk you back?\u201d James leapt to his feet. Both girls giggled, as if he had said something charming, rather than ridiculous,\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep her safe on the arduous journey across the common room, Potter.\u201d Mary teased.\n\n\nStill Lily and James spent the next five minutes bidding each other goodbye, which involved a lot of snogging. When Mary finally managed to drag her friend away, Lily was pink and grinning,\n\n\n\u201cLove you!\u201d She called on her way down the stairs,\n\n\n\u201cLove you too!\u201d James called back.\n\n\nSirius began to make sick noises, which made Peter start laughing, but Remus just watched James\u2019s dopey expression. He hadn\u2019t heard them say \u2018I love you\u2019 before. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever heard anyone say it, actually; not anyone he cared about, at least. He\u2019d seen it written down. In books, and in the letter from Hope. But neither of those things had felt as tangible as this. How long had they been saying that? As long as they\u2019d been feeling it? Was it hard to say the first time? Remus thought it must be. Like casting a patronus.\n\n\nHe finished his cigarette in a contemplative mood while the others moved around him, finishing homework and changing for bed. He supposed he could ask Sirius about the whole \u2018love\u2019 thing, but he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to open that can of worms. They were happy as they were, weren\u2019t they? It was just getting comfortable, now that their friends knew. Plus, after two years of pining and almost a year of secrecy, Remus wanted to just enjoy what they had, without all of that prescriptive stuff hanging over them.\n\n\nRemus knew from experience that it was best to resist the temptation to pick things like that apart. Especially something as precious and hard won as he and Sirius had. The problem was; once you started, you might never remember how it worked in the first place.\n\n\nHe brushed his teeth still thinking, and wandered towards Sirius\u2019s bed to sit and wait for him.\n\n\n\u201cFinished!\u201d Peter cried, raising his quill with a flourish. \u201c\n\n\nFinally\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell done, Pete.\u201d James yawned, climbing into bed.\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get to help you lot, though.\u201d Peter said, looking at the pile of envelopes wistfully.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ok, this is only preliminary work.\u201d Remus offered, \u201cThe\n\n\nreal\n\n\nplanning starts on Wednesday.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d James nodded encouragingly, \u201cAnyway, don\u2019t feel bad, Padfoot didn\u2019t help either.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOi!\u201d Sirius came out of the bathroom at that moment, \u201cI\n\n\nwrote\n\n\nthe damn things! Where would you lot be without my beautiful penmanship? And I don\u2019t recall Mrs Prongs doing anything either.\u201d\n\n\nHe had taken to calling Lily this in private (he wouldn\u2019t dare to her face) with the full knowledge that it annoyed James. The messy haired boy just rolled over in bed, flicking his middle finger in Sirius\u2019s direction. Sirius chuckled and got into his own bed. Remus got in too, still deep in thought.\n\n\n\u201cNight lads!\u201d Sirius called, drawing the curtains shut.\n\n\n\u201cNight!\u201d Peter and James echoed back.\n\n\nIn the dark, Sirius held Remus\u2019s hand, and they smiled at each other sleepily.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re very quiet.\u201d Sirius whispered. \u201cEverything ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus whispered back. \u201cJust thinking. Prank stuff.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...Sirius?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know Valentine\u2019s Day?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHeard of it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDid you want to\u2026 er. What Mary said\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\n\n\nknew\n\n\nthat would get you wound up. I could practically see your brain start to overheat.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPiss off.\u201d Remus kicked his shin. \u201cI\u2019m just\n\n\nasking\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMary loved all that stuff - presents and flowers and cards and shit. I liked doing it for her, because it made her happy. You\u2019d hate it, so I won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so public,\u201d Remus said.\n\n\n\u201cI know. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nStop worrying\n\n\n!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine, fine, I believe you!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s not even a real thing.\u201d Sirius said, thoughtfully. \u201cValentine\u2019s day. I looked it up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s real to muggles, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Remus frowned. He couldn\u2019t say he\u2019d given it much thought.\n\n\n\u201cThere was a bloke called Valentine, but there\u2019s nothing especially romantic about it.\n\n\nBut\n\n\nI did find out some other stuff, about the Romans.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you apply this thirst for knowledge to your actual schoolwork?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUgh, don\u2019t be so boring. Anyway, have you heard of the Lupercalia?\u201d\n\n\nRemus felt a sinking feeling in his stomach and let go of Sirius\u2019s hand.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about wolf stuff right now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou have heard of it!\u201d Sirius sounded pleased.\n\n\n\u201cNo. I just know the latin for wolf because it\u2019s my bloody name.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh right\u2026 It\u2019s not what you think, it\u2019s a festival!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s really cool, there are blood sacrifices, and running around naked, and--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut you\n\n\nlike\n\n\nhistory.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up, Padfoot, he wants to go to sleep.\u201d James shouted from across the room. \u201cAnd so do I!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Peter echoed.\n\n\n\u201cMind your own business.\u201d Sirius shouted back.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nSonoro Quiesces\n\n\n.\u201d Remus muttered, creating a dry bubble of silence inside the bed. He still whispered when he spoke, though, because it was weird to talk an normal volume in the dark. \u201cI said I didn\u2019t want to talk about wolf stuff,\n\n\ngod\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was only trying to make you feel better about Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel badly about it in the first place!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk, sorry, I misread you.\u201d Sirius was whispering too, but loudly, obviously annoyed. \u201cYou were all quiet about it and I wanted to cheer you up. I thought you were jealous of Lily and James.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJealous?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the wrong word. You were just\u2026 I saw you watching them, kissing and stuff, and being all mushy. And I\n\n\nknow\n\n\nyou hate public displays of affection, but I dunno. It\u2019s not like we have a choice either way...\u201d\n\n\nRemus blinked in the dark, rolling back over to see Sirius\u2019s face.\n\n\n\u201cIt bothers\n\n\nyou\n\n\n, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d It had to, because it had never bothered Remus before. Sudden;y he realised what it had all been about.\n\n\n\u201cA bit, maybe.\u201d Sirius replied, honestly. Remus fumbled under the duvet for his hand again.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nTuesday 14th February 1978\n\n\nThe next morning, James and Sirius were nowhere to be found - Remus presumed they had left early for quidditch practice; it was a bright, sunny day, despite a chill in the air. After a few minutes of deep thought, Remus rifled in his bedside drawer for his very last chocolate frog and bunged it in his pocket before heading downstairs.\n\n\nThe rest of the Gryffindors awoke to find that in the night the house elves had decorated their common room with garlands of red and pink paper hearts - something which seemed to divide all of the students.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hardly appropriate in a\n\n\nschool\n\n\n.\u201d Christopher grumbled, meeting Remus and Mary on their way out of the portrait hole.\n\n\n\u201cAww, I think it\u2019s lovely.\u201d Mary sighed, cheerily. She was subtly dressed for the occasion, wearing a red ribbon in her hair, and red enamel studs in each earlobe. Christopher shook his head, grimly at her.\n\n\n\u201cIf it were a proper holiday, like Christmas, or Easter or something--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut why\n\n\ndo\n\n\nwizards celebrate those things?\u201d Remus cut in, thoughtfully, as they progressed towards the dining hall. Every corridor was also decked out in pink and red crepe paper, and there seemed to be music coming from somewhere, \u201cNone of the purebloods I\u2019ve met are Christians, or even know anything about Jesus, or the Easter bunny, or--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe Easter\n\n\nwhat\n\n\n?!\u201d Christopher was staring at him as if he was mad.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother, Remus,\u201d Mary laughed, \u201cLily and I tried back in first year. We\u2019re not supposed to ask.\u201d\n\n\nChristopher\u2019s mood did not improve as they entered the Great Hall, which was bathed in a rosey pink glow by a collection of candles floating inside red glass lanterns. Fresh flowers had been placed in vases on every table, and pink envelopes flew back and forth over the heads of the students - valentine\u2019s cards looking for their recipient.\n\n\n\u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake.\u201d Christopher muttered, taking his seat and pouring himself a very black coffee.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only one day.\u201d Remus said, lifting the teapot, which was also pink.\n\n\nNo sooner had they sat down, than a pile of pink envelopes fluttered into Mary\u2019s lap, making her squeal with delight. Remus grinned too. He pulled out his own envelopes and whispered an incantation, tossing them into the air so that they mingled with the others flying above them.\n\n\n\u201cHere you go, Chris,\u201d Remus tossed one across the table, \u201cIt\u2019s not a valentine, promise.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh. Er\u2026 what is it?\u201d Christopher held the blank envelope warily.\n\n\n\u201cAn invitation.\u201d Remus winked. \u201cGive it your name, but don\u2019t share it, ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 ok\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d Lily appeared, looking cheerful as usual, clutching a book on advanced potions. \u201cAnyone seen Potter?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cQuidditch pitch?\u201d Remus raised his head.\n\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d Lily shrugged, \u201cI thought so too, but Ravenclaw booked it this morning.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe and Padfoot were gone when I woke up.\u201d Remus said.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I was afraid of\u2026\u201d Lily replied, taking her seat.\n\n\nNo sooner than she had sugared her porridge, than a loud *pop* echoed over their heads, and everyone looked up. Those students who hadn\u2019t immediately dived for cover beneath their breakfast tables began \u2018oohing\u2019 and \u2018ahhing\u2019, as a rather spectacular fireworks display began over their heads. The bursts of colour took the form of gigantic glittering love hearts, and the embers which rained down turned out to be pink and white flowerheads,\n\n\n\u201cLilies!\u201d Mary said gleefully, as one settled on her pile of cards.\n\n\n\u201cOh no!\u201d Christopher wailed, \u201cI\u2019m allergic!\u201d He sneezed, before aiming his wand upwards and gasping, \u201c\n\n\nProtego\n\n\n!\u201d to defend himself against the fluttering blooms.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe this\u2026\u201d Lily was blushing harder than Remus had ever seen her. He grinned,\n\n\n\u201cYou were asking for it, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have been happy with a card!\u201d She hissed, as the final fireworks died out, and the last of the lilies sailed to the floor like great pink snowflakes, filling the room with their lovely scent.\n\n\n\u201cOh shut up, Evans,\u201d Mary tutted, \u201cIt\u2019s bloody gorgeous of him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCheers, MacDonald,\u201d James appeared at Lily\u2019s shoulder, with Sirius.\n\n\n\u201cYou utter idiot!\u201d Lily stood up and wound her arms around James\u2019s neck, kissing him. Remus wasn\u2019t watching this display, though; he was watching Sirius, who flicked his wand behind James\u2019s back.\n\n\nThe flowers which had gathered on the table (those which Chris had not tried to clear, anyway) began to move again, and gathered together in front of Lily\u2019s plate. With another soft little *pop*, the pile had transformed into a large box, emblazoned with even more lilies.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Lily turned, leaning over to get a closer look.\n\n\n\u201cOpen it and see!\u201d James was grinning ear to ear, clearly utterly chuffed with himself.\n\n\nChristopher sneezed again, and blew his nose, but was roundly ignored as Mary and Remus stood up to get a better look. Lily, still pink and smiling, carefully lifted the lid of the box, and everyone leaned in. On a red velvet pillow, with a bow around its neck, was a tiny little charcoal grey kitten with huge yellow eyes.\n\n\n\u201cOhhh!\u201d Lily gasped, reaching in immediately to pick up the mewing creature and cuddle it close, \u201cReally, Potter?! You got me a cat?! I love him! Or\u2026 her?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHim,\u201d James nodded, \u201cI know your old family one died last Christmas, and Hagrid told me a litter was born in the village last week, so\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh he\u2019s so sweet!\u201d Mary reached over to stroke the kitten\u2019s head.\n\n\n\u201cOh for Merlin\u2019s sake\u2026\u201d Christopher stood up, clutching his handkerchief to his nose. \u201cI\u2019m allergic to cats, too! Bloody stupid day\u2026\u201d with that, he got up and stormed away, further up the table.\n\n\n\u201cSuch a shame.\u201d Sirius smirked, taking his empty seat. \u201cMorning, Moony.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMorning, Padfoot.\u201d Remus smiled.\n\n\nThe rest of breakfast was spent cooing over Lily\u2019s new kitten, and trying to choose a name. Remus kept a polite distance; just in case. He\u2019d had bad experiences with cats in the past, and didn\u2019t fancy any new scratches today, no matter how tiny its claws were.\n\n\nSoon, everyone was getting up to go to their various lessons (while arguing over who ought to look after the kitten that morning), and Sirius fell into step with Remus,\n\n\n\u201cWalk you to history?\u201d He offered,\n\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t need to go,\u201d Remus replied, slyly, \u201cIt\u2019s a drop-in lesson, for NEWTs.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut you\n\n\nalways\n\n\ngo to your lessons,\u201d Sirius replied, \u201cEven the optional ones.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know, but\n\n\nyou\u2019re\n\n\nalways telling me to relax, so\u2026\u201d Remus covertly pulled his little matchbox out of his robe pocket and tapped it. Sirius raised an eyebrow,\n\n\n\u201cAs much as I really love stoned Moony - what\u2019s brought on the rebelliousness?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoes there have to be a reason?\u201d Remus shrugged. He glanced around quickly to check that no one was listening too intently - but they were all pretty absorbed in their various cards and gifts. He slipped the chocolate frog into Sirius\u2019s pocket. \u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day, wanker.\u201d\n\n\nHe had never seen Sirius Black blush like that."

Flitwick always lets me use it.\u201d Remus replied.\n\n\n\u201cExactly! It\u2019s so brazen!\u201d Christopher chided, as they entered.\n\n\n\u201cBrazen is our middle name!\u201d James declared excitedly, following them.\n\n\n\u201cYour middle name is Fleamont, you prat.\u201d Sirius scoffed. \u201cAnd this place is\n\n\ngenius\n\n\n, no one will ever suspect anything.

He glanced at his pocket watch. \u201cWe\u2019re all nice and early, James, have you got an agenda?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d James turned around from the blackboard, where he was directing the chalk to draw a gigantic lion with \u2018\n\n\nGryffindor Rulez OK\n\n\n\u2019 beneath it.\n\n\n\u201cNever mind.\u201d Remus sighed.\n\n\n\u201cSo who else got an invitation?\u201d Christopher asked, over the top of his book (which seemed to have materialised from nowhere - Christopher was the only other person Remus knew who could go from 0 to reading in less than three seconds flat).\n\n\n\u201cAbout twenty or thirty people, maybe.\u201d Remus said, \u201cAnyone who expressed an interested before Christmas who seemed trustworthy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was an extremely rigorous vetting process, actually,\u201d James said, now standing on Flitwick\u2019s desk and trying to touch the ceiling with his fingertips.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, we almost didn\u2019t let Wormtail in.\u201d Sirius barked with laughter from the window, where he was leaning half out of it, smoking. Remus dearly wanted to go over there and wrap his arms around Sirius, steal the cigarette (which was probably one of his anyway, the thief) and kiss his neck. But the others would be arriving soon, and it was a completely mental line of thinking, that.\n\n\n\u201cWhy do you all call Peter that?\u201d Christopher asked.\n\n\n\u201cJust a nickname.\u201d They all said, in unison.\n\n\nPeter arrived shortly after that, followed in by Mary, Lily and Yasmin. Next were the sixth and seventh years from Remus\u2019s study group, and Dorcas - who was still on friendly terms with Peter, apparently. Mary\u2019s latest squeeze, a Ravenclaw boy called Jonty Simmons, who looked like he couldn\u2019t believe his luck. And finally, much to Remus\u2019s distaste, Emmeline Vance sauntered in (two minutes late) with Roman Rotherhide.\n\n\nThe room was pretty crowded after that, and noisy with the buzz of excitement. Most of the group had some idea why they were there, but others were curious, and all of them were fascinated by the marauders.\n\n\nSirius and James adored the attention, of course, and immediately took centre stage.\n\n\n\u201cNow, we all know why we\u2019re here,\u201d James started, using his quidditch captain voice.\n\n\nImmediately, Emmeline Vance\u2019s arm shot up.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, but\n\n\nI\n\n\ndon\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus gave an impatient snort and Christopher, sitting next to him, shot him a strange look.\n\n\n\u201cNor do I!\u201d Dorcas raised her hand too, along with one or two sixth years from Remus\u2019s study group.\n\n\n\u201cWhy did all of you come, then?!\u201d Sirius asked, eyebrows raised. A group of girls sitting at the back of the room giggled. Remus made a mental note. He\u2019d tried to avoid inviting too many members of the Sirius Black fanclub, but it was pretty unavoidable when that applied to half the school.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to plan a\u2026 an organised protest,\u201d Christopher said, blushing a bit, because he wasn\u2019t used to speaking in front of lots of people. \u201cAgainst Slytherin.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Another sixth year shouted, \u201cI heard you lot were planning your biggest prank yet!\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nI\n\n\nheard one of you knows how to get to the monster out of the chamber of secrets!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI heard you were planning to blow up the dungeons!\u201d One Hufflepuff boy squeaked.\n\n\n\u201cWoah woah woah,\u201d James held up his hands, \u201cBit less dramatic than that\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, if it\u2019s about getting the Slytherins back for all the nonsense they\u2019ve pulled, I\u2019m in.\u201d Emmeline said, decisively, tossing her luxuriant blonde curls. Remus tutted, loudly, and Chris shot him another look.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s about. And exactly why we need all of you to keep quiet about it.\u201d James said, getting into his flow, now. \u201cThis is our last year, and we\u2019re inviting all of you to help us plan our final prank.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoes that make us marauders?\u201d The Hufflepuff boy squeaked again. There was an excited murmur.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nNo\n\n\n.\u201d Peter said, indignantly, though no one really paid him any attention.\n\n\n\u201cI like to think of it as more of a collaboration.\u201d James said, thoughtfully.\n\n\n\u201cAn inter-house co-operative!\u201d Sirius added.\n\n\nEveryone seemed pretty please with that. At least, it sounded impressive, and official enough.\n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d James clapped his hands together and rubbed them, smiling round at everyone. \u201cNow that\u2019s out of the way, who\u2019s got some ideas?!\u201d\n\n\nTwenty hands shot up.\n\n\n\u201cErr,\u201d Lily spoke up, \u201cI think before we get into that it might be good to have some ground rules?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Sirius folded his arms, grumpily.\n\n\n\u201cLike not actually\n\n\nhurting\n\n\nanyone? This is just fun, ok? Not revenge for everything Slytherin\u2019s ever done.\u201d She was using her Head Girl voice, now, and a few people lowered their hands.\n\n\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d James said, holding up his hands amicably, coming between Sirius and Lily. \u201cNo physical harm intended. And as I said before, no talking about it outside of this room. On pain of death.\n\n\nJoking\n\n\n, Evans!\u201d He ducked as she went to slap the back of his head.\n\n\nAfter these initial teething problems, everyone seemed to enter into the spirit of the thing. Lots of people had ideas - from the extreme (Lily vetoed summoning a banshee to haunt the dungeons), to the subtle (Emmeline knew of a spell which would transfigure everyone\u2019s right shoe into a left shoe - she said she\u2019d done it to her sister over the summer and it had taken her three days to realise what had been bothering her).\n\n\nEventually, time ran short, so James set everyone \u2018homework\u2019 - requiring them to come back next week with an idea.\n\n\n\u201cThen we can decide on the best one.\u201d Sirius declared.\n\n\n\u201cWho decides?\u201d Mary narrowed her eyes.\n\n\n\u201cMe, James, Pete and Moony, obviously.\u201d Sirius raised his chin.\n\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t we vote?\u201d One of the sixth years asked.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, that seems fairer.\u201d Mary nodded. \u201cIf we\u2019re all putting ourselves at risk of expulsion for you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExpulsion?!\u201d Christopher bit his lip, \u201cSurely not\u2026 surely we won\u2019t go that far\u2026?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nWill\n\n\nwe get in trouble, though?\u201d The hufflepuff boy raised his hand again. Everyone looked at him.\n\n\n\u201cNot much.\u201d Sirius shrugged. \u201cBit of detention never hurt anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, sorry, I don\u2019t mean detention.\u201d The boy shook his head, nervously. \u201cI mean with\u2026 you know the Slytherins. They won\u2019t\u2026 tell the death eaters to get us, will they?\u201d\n\n\nSirius looked about to laugh, when he realised that the atmosphere in the room had changed. A few people looked very awkward, some of then were whispering amongst themselves. Remus could even smell a whiff of real fear creeping into the room; everybody seemed to have tensed up a bit.\n\n\nOf course, Sirius and James did not worry about that sort of thing. This was all part of the crusade of chaos they\u2019d been on since they were eleven. Even Remus had been pretty flippant about the magnitude of the prank. But he saw now that it meant a lot more to those gathered in the room. James, Sirius and Peter were the only purebloods in attendance. Unless you counted Christopher, who had his own axe to grind with the Slytherins.\n\n\nJames stood up again, pushing off Flitwick\u2019s desk and drawing himself to full height.\n\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not. No one in this room is getting hurt because of this prank.\u201d\n\n\nA few people relaxed - after all, James Potter, heir to the Sleek-ezy fortune, head boy, quidditch captain and leading mischief maker was somebody that most people trusted. Remus believed him whole-heartedly - even if the issue had not been raised, it would have been a point of honour for James to protect anyone smaller than him. Lily was beaming at him too, and Sirius looked very pleased, as if that had settled everything.\n\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Lily clapped her hands together now, taking the floor again, \u201cSee you all again next week, I suppose. I think we\u2019d all better leave in small groups, don\u2019t want to draw attention to ourselves\u2026\u201d\n\n\nWith that, the room slowly returned to normal, groups of students now chattering excitedly about ideas they\u2019d had, or curses they\u2019d like to try out. Lily assumed her Head Girl voice and started directing people out of the room in groups of three or four, at short intervals. The marauders turned inwards, to confer.\n\n\n\u201cBloody hell.\u201d James muttered, so that he wouldn\u2019t be overheard, \u201cThat was intense.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d Mary tutted, hoisting herself up onto the desk and swinging her legs. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game to everyone - some people are out for revenge.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen that\u2019s what we\u2019ll give them.\u201d Sirius said, fiercely. He had that brightness in his eyes that told Remus he would be utterly unbearable for the next few hours. A plan was afoot, and nothing could bring Sirius down from that kind of excitement.\n\n\n\u201cCalm down, Black,\u201d Mary teased, \u201cYou\u2019re schoolkids, not generals.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFor now.\u201d He replied, darkly.\n\n\n\u201cOk you lot,\u201d Lily turned back into the room. It was only the seven of them left. \u201cWe\u2019ll go back in two groups, because\n\n\nno one\n\n\nis going to believe you four weren\u2019t up to something\u2026\u201d\n\n\nMary, James, Lily and Peter left first, with instructions for Remus, Sirius and Christopher to give them a ten minute head start. Remus was a bit reluctant about this, but there was no way to bring it up. He couldn\u2019t help remembering what had happened the last time he and Christopher were alone in that classroom with Sirius. Though, of course, Christopher hadn\u2019t known Sirius was there at the time, and nor would Remus ever tell him.\n\n\nThey tidied up the desks, cleared the chalkboard of James\u2019s lion, then stood about awkwardly for a little bit.\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s play truth or dare.\u201d Sirius grinned.\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Remus sighed, leaning on the desk.\n\n\nHere we go...\n\n\n\n\u201cPass the time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOr we could just have a normal conversation\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cChristopher wants to, don\u2019t you, Christopher?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cErr\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGreat, you can go first. Truth or dare, what do you fancy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUm.\u201d Chris\u2019s eyes flicked between Remus and Sirius nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 um\u2026 truth?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExcellent! Start off easy, if it\u2019s your first time playing,\u201d Sirius nodded encouragingly. \u201cHmmm, let me see\u2026 ah! Ok, why did you want to get involved with the prank?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cY\u2019know. How come you came today?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cChris has been involved since the beginning, Padfoot, you know that.\u201d Remus tutted.\n\n\n\u201cRight, right - so what made you get involved in the first place, then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you have to know.\u201d Christopher said, rather icily, \u201cIt was your brother.\u201d\n\n\nSirius, to his credit, did not flinch.\n\n\n\u201cFair enough, he\u2019s a right little prick.\u201d He nodded. He licked his lips, and glanced at Remus, then back at Chris. \u201cSure there was no other reason?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go next,\u201d Remus said, quickly. \u201cChris, you can ask me to do a dare.\u201d He never picked \u2018truth\u2019, it was far too dangerous.\n\n\n\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d Christopher bit his lip, still a bit thrown by this whole thing. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m crap at this sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a good one!\u201d Sirius said at once. He winked at Remus, then leaned over and whispered in Chris\u2019s ear. Christopher\u2019s eyes widened and he laughed, covering his mouth.\n\n\n\u201cOk, Remus,\u201d Chris was still blushing, but he was having fun now. \u201cOk, you have to write something rude on the blackboard and leave it there.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI gave you specifics.\u201d Sirius complained.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that out loud!\u201d Christopher laughed, turning even redder. Remus could easily guess the tone of Sirius\u2019s suggestion. He raised an eyebrow wryly, as if under duress,\n\n\n\u201cOk, fine, I\u2019ll do it\u2026\u201d\n\n\nHe went up to the board and picked up some chalk. He considered it for a moment, \u201cHow rude?\u201d He asked the other two, casually.\n\n\n\u201cVery.\u201d Christopher said, smirking shyly.\n\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s the rules of the game, I s\u2019pose\u2026\u201d Remus began to draw, enjoying the snickering over his shoulder as he deftly traced out the first rude thing that popped into his head.\n\n\nHe stepped back, an artist admiring his work. The other two boys stood either side of him, grinning madly. \u201cWell?\u201d He asked.\n\n\nSirius slapped him on the back,\n\n\n\u201cMoony, me old pal, it\u2019s the biggest knob I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a relief.\u201d Remus smirked, forgetting Christopher was there. He didn\u2019t seem to notice - or else just assumed that it was marauder humour (which it sort of was).\n\n\n\u201cGlorious.\u201d The younger boy nodded, still very pink about the cheeks.\n\n\n\u201cCome on then,\u201d Remus set down the chalk, \u201cThat\u2019s enough of a gap, we can go now. Common room?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOi, I\u2019ve not had my turn, yet!\u201d Sirius folded his arms.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point,\u201d Remus shook his head, \u201cYou always choose a dare, and there\u2019s nothing I can think of that you\u2019d even think twice about doing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m the\n\n\nbravest\n\n\n--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStupidest, maybe,\u201d Remus teased, elbowing him in the ribs. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\n\nThey left the classroom and set off through the quiet hallways back to Gryffindor tower. It was fairly late in the evening now, and curfew was only a couple of hours off, so they were alone most of the way, other than the portraits, who were enjoying the peace and quiet.\n\n\n\u201cDid you finish\n\n\nMaurice\n\n\n, Remus?\u201d Chris asked. Always back to books.\n\n\n\u201cNearly,\u201d Remus replied. \u201cJust a chapter or two to go. Do you promise me it\u2019s a happy ending?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Chris nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ll love it. I was thinking\u2026 if you\u2019re free on Saturday we could have a chat about it in the Three Broomsticks? I\u2019d really like to know what you think.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, maybe\u2026\u201d Remus was torn between his desire not to disappoint Christopher (which he always seemed to be doing) and his keen awareness of Sirius\u2019s very mercurial mood. \u201cDon\u2019t see why not.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs that the muggle book you\u2019ve been reading?\u201d Sirius asked, \u201cIs it good then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, quite good.\u201d Remus nodded, cautiously.\n\n\n\u201cGreat. Maybe I\u2019ll read it then. I can get it done by Saturday, I read faster than you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou do\n\n\nnot\n\n\n!\u201d Remus scowled, scandalised.\n\n\n\u201cWell I have more time to read, anyway.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOnly because you hardly go to half your lessons.\u201d Remus shot back.\n\n\n\u201cI doubt it\u2019s your sort of thing, Sirius.\u201d Christopher spoke up. They both looked at him. He shrugged, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not! Tell him what it\u2019s about, Remus.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026\u201d\n\n\nBut it was too late, Sirius was already rummaging in the book bag at Remus\u2019s hip as they walked, and at once withdrew the text. Remus fought the urge to snatch it back, only because he\u2019d underlined some parts of it, just because he\u2019d liked them so much, and he was embarrassed about it now.\n\n\n\n(I think you\u2019re beautiful, the only beautiful person I\u2019ve ever seen. I love your voice and everything to do with you, down to your clothes or the room you are sitting in. I adore you.)\n\n\n\nFortunately, Sirius didn\u2019t flip through the pages, only looked at the back cover, frowning slightly.\n\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this one of my uncle\u2019s?\u201d He asked.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, you said I could borrow it\u2026\u201d Remus rubbed the back of his head.\n\n\n\u201cIs it dirty?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh well. I\u2019ll read it anyway.\u201d Sirius poked out his tongue. \u201cThat can be my dare.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cVery brave.\u201d Remus grabbed back the book and shoved it in his bag.\n\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s about\u2026\u201d Christopher frowned. They were almost at the portrait hole now, and Sirius stopped, making all three of them stop too. Sirius looked at Remus, raising an eyebrow, he nodded to Chris.\n\n\n\u201cHe makes a lot of assumptions, this one.\u201d\n\n\nRemus was surprised to find that his own cheeks were heating up, too. He shrugged,\n\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know you very well.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOi, Christopher?\u201d Sirius shot him a very wicked look. \u201cDare me to snog Moony?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWha-- I--?!\u201d Christopher looked stricken, as if he knew there was a joke somewhere, but he couldn\u2019t figure out the punchline.\n\n\nSirius wasted no time. He took Remus\u2019s head, roughly, and pulled him in for a kiss. Remus gave in. It was a bit mean, but he could hardly refuse. If it was a test of loyalty, or simply something Sirius thought would be funny, he had to go along with it.\n\n\n\u201cOh for merlin\u2019s sake!\u201d A voice came from further up the corridor, causing Sirius and Remus to spring apart. \u201cI\u2019m away for a week and the castle turns into an orgy!\u201d\n\n\nAll three boys spun around to see Marlene standing there in her travelling cloak, duffle bag at her side. She gave them a knowing smirk, \u201cWhat a load of queers.\u201d"

Sirius ushered her through the fat lady portrait as fast as he could, and practically trumpeted her arrival to the whole common room, as though he had conjured her from thin air.\n\n\nLily and James rushed over, hugging her and taking her bag, and cloak and leading her to the couch by the fireplace, where Mary hugged her so fiercely Marlene almost squeaked.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve missed you!\u201d Mary exclaimed, finally letting her friend go.\n\n\n\u201cI can see that!\u201d Marlene gasped, pink cheeked. \u201cHave you all been that bored without me?\u201d\n\n\nRemus hung back a little. He and Marlene didn\u2019t hug much, anyway, so he didn\u2019t think it would be noticed. He watched her warily, and chose to sit in the armchair furthest away from her, trying not to draw attention to himself. Christopher had slipped away too, at some point, maybe up to his dorm room. In the back of his mind, Remus hoped Chris wasn\u2019t angry with him, but he filed that away for another time. He had too much to worry about with Marlene\u2019s return.\n\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s Danny?\u201d Mary was asking now, lowering her voice.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 recovering.\u201d Marlene nodded, her eyes serious. \u201cHe\u2019s at home now, mum\u2019s driving him crazy as usual. He won\u2019t\u2026 he won\u2019t be going back to the Cannons.\u201d She swallowed and looked down at her hands.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bloody disgrace.\u201d James banged his fist on the arm of the couch, \u201cIf I was their manager, I\u2019d--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s too badly injured, anyway.\u201d Marlene shook her head, wiping quickly under her eyes, \u201cHe\u2019d have been off for the rest of the season either way; it\u2019ll be months before he\u2019s back on a broom. So. Just as well.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStill bollocks.\u201d James muttered.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, well.\u201d Marlene looked up, stonily. \u201cCan hardly blame them. I know\n\n\nI\n\n\nwould have\u2026 anyway. Not worth thinking about.\u201d\n\n\nRemus felt sick with tension. Everyone else sitting in the group knew what he was - everyone\n\n\nexcept\n\n\nMarlene. The guilt he had been successfully avoiding for a week came crashing back over him like a cold shower. It had been\n\n\nhis\n\n\nresponsibility to warn everyone of the attack. He had told Dumbledore, but it hadn\u2019t been enough; he\u2019d failed. And now the evidence of his failure was sitting right in front of him, her face thin and her eyes dark with worry.\n\n\nMarlene cleared her throat and flashed them all a brave smile,\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to talk to Madam Pomfrey as soon as I can; see if she recommends anything. The healers at St Mungo\u2019s were useless, more concerned with keeping him quarantined than actually\n\n\nhelping\n\n\nhim. Hardly anyone could answer the questions I had about transformations, or aftercare, or pain relief\u2026 it was like they\u2019d rather I just stopped talking about him; like they wanted to pretend he wasn\u2019t there...\u201d\n\n\nHer voice was getting higher and thinner as she said this, tears threatening to choke her. She cleared her throat again. \u201cI mean, I\n\n\nknow\n\n\nwhat he is, don\u2019t get me wrong. I know what he\u2019s going to become. But he\u2019s still my brother for fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course he is.\u201d Mary said, squeezing Marlene\u2019s hand. She gave Remus a look, and he looked at his feet.\n\n\nNo. No way. Absolutely not.\n\n\n\nNo one else was speaking, but they all had the same look on their faces.\n\n\nAre they thinking about me?\n\n\nRemus wondered, queasily,\n\n\ndo they blame me? Are they wondering what I\u2019m capable of?\n\n\n\n\u201cAnyway.\u201d Marlene shook her head again. \u201cWhat\u2019s been going on here? Is that your cat, Lily?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cValentine\u2019s day present,\u201d Lily smiled, stroking the purring bundle in her lap. \u201cHis name\u2019s Hieronymus.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCatchy.\u201d Marlene sniffed, smiling. \u201cNice one, Potter, you big softie.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re still on the team, right?\u201d James asked, leaning forward, \u201cMy star beater?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cObviously,\u201d She rolled her eyes, \u201cI\u2019m assuming the training times haven\u2019t changed\u2026?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFirst thing tomorrow morning.\u201d James grinned.\n\n\n\u201cAnd, we\u2019re planning this huge--\u201d Peter started, eagerly, but was cut off,\n\n\n\u201cOi, McKinnon.\u201d\n\n\nThey all turned around to see Yasmin standing behind the couch, hands on her hips and grinning widely. She\u2019d obviously been getting ready for bed, her hair was piled messily up on her head and she was wearing in her oversized Holyhead Harpies shirt and a baggy pair of men\u2019s winceyette pyjama bottoms.\n\n\n\u201cAlright, Patel?\u201d Marlene answered. Remus couldn\u2019t see her face but he knew she was smiling. She twisted round on the couch and got up on her knees, and the girls hugged tightly.\n\n\nYou could do that, Remus realised, if you were girls. No one thought it was weird. He wondered if Sirius was thinking the same thing. He hoped not.\n\n\nThat pretty much put an end to any more werewolf talk, which was a relief. Remus just hoped he could avoid it later, when it was just him and Sirius. He was sure to want to know how Remus\n\n\nfelt\n\n\n, and what his\n\n\nthoughts\n\n\nwere\u2026 and while yes, ok, Remus did understand that communication was important and blah blah blah\u2026 did that mean they had to discuss every painful thing in minute detail?!\n\n\nFor god\u2019s sake. He was already getting agitated about it, and it hadn\u2019t even happened. He cracked his neck and then his shoulders, willing himself to loosen up. He was still a bit wound up from that kiss out in the corridor, he realised. He wasn\u2019t sure whether or not Sirius had meant it that way, or if it was all just a show for Christopher, but it had stirred something in Remus, and now it felt like\u2026 unfinished business. He shifted a bit in his seat, and tried to ignore that, too.\n\n\nMary had tactfully moved to the other end of the couch, and was now casually filing her nails and chatting to Lily, who was teasing Hieronymus with a quill.\n\n\nYaz climbed over the back of the sofa to take her place, and she and Marlene had their heads together, speaking very quickly and very quietly. Remus caught the muggy scent of the\n\n\nmuffliato\n\n\nspell, which was odder from the outside than the inside - as if their very words were blurred out somehow. They were sitting so close to each other that their thighs touched, Yaz\u2019s arm slung around the back of the couch just behind Marlene\u2019s head, in a way that would have raised eyebrows, even if only\n\n\none\n\n\nof them was a boy.\n\n\nJames and Sirius were in a deep conversation about the upcoming quidditch match against Ravenclaw, Peter eagerly interjecting every now and then with his own tactical insights. Remus pulled his book out and tried to read. It was no good; he couldn\u2019t concentrate with so many people chatting.\n\n\nThe last postcard from Grant was tucked into the dust jacket of\n\n\nMaurice\n\n\n, and he read it again. This time the photo on the front was of three bikini clad girls frolicking in the sea. Even Sirius had found that one funny. There wasn\u2019t much on the back - Grant was a man of few words, when it came to written correspondence.\n\n\n\nWorking hard, having fun. Hope you\u2019re well.\n\n\n\n\nLove.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat word again. Obviously Grant could say it. Or write it. He couldn\u2019t spell Remus\u2019s surname the same way twice, but\n\n\nlove\n\n\nwas no big deal. Ugh. Only half an hour ago, Remus had been almost completely free from worry; cocooned by his friends, and Sirius, and the idiotic notion that everything would be ok, if they could just come up with a really good prank.\n\n\nBut the shade had fallen now, and no matter where he looked, all Remus could see was trouble and his own failings. Frustrated, he slammed his book closed on the postcard, a little too hard. Everyone looked up.\n\n\n\u201cAll right there, Moony?\u201d Lily asked, gently.\n\n\n\u201cFine. Sorry.\u201d Remus nodded. He reached into his pockets for a cigarette, pulling out his matchbox quickly.\n\n\n\u201cNot in the common room, please!\u201d Lily switched to head girl mode as quick as a flash.\n\n\n\u201cRight, right, sorry\u2026\u201d He clumsily clambered to his feet, fag pursed between his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll go upstairs.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to bed too.\u201d Marlene said, then blushed and stammered quickly, \u201cI mean, upstairs. To sleep. Erm. You know - if we\u2019ve got an early practice\u2026\u201d\n\n\nYaz was barely able to keep a straight face as she waved goodbye to them all, before hurrying up the stairs after her girlfriend. Mary and Remus shared a knowing look, but James and Lily still seemed blissfully ignorant.\n\n\n\u201cNight.\u201d Remus nodded to everyone, heaving his bag onto his shoulder and heading up the opposite flight of stairs to the boys dormitories.\n\n\nIt was a mistake. Alone, he had nothing to distract him from his own judgements - and they were harsh. Quite right too, in Remus\u2019s opinion. If the McKinnon family could not forget the repercussions of his failure to act, then why should he have any respite? And those were just the people he\n\n\nknew\n\n\nhe had let down - there were families up and down the country now facing a full moon for the first time. It was a good thing his father was dead, and his mother had washed her hands of him. At least he couldn\u2019t cause them any more pain.\n\n\nHe sat on the window ledge, letting the cold air wash over him, smoking and thinking and scolding himself until he thought he may as well just fling himself out of it. But that was just a passing fancy. Remus was too much of a coward to do what ought to be done; this much he knew.\n\n\nStill, he felt a strong urge to do something. Something drastic, something violent. The wolf inside would have liked a good long run, but it would be past curfew soon. There was a bit of dope in his sock drawer, but that would only make him more gloomy. Someone was hiding a bottle of firewhisky; he could smell it, but that was probably in preparation for his own upcoming birthday, and he couldn\u2019t spoil that for his friends. Maybe put a record on and flail around a bit, but he\u2019d never been much for dancing, and his hip was bothering him.\n\n\nSirius\u2019s footfall on the stairs disrupted his thoughts. Remus licked his lips, remembering that kiss from earlier. Ah. There was always that. The ultimate distraction.\n\n\nDecision made, he stubbed out the cigarette and got up, striding purposefully across the room. He reached the door just as Sirius pushed it open - best not to even give him a chance.\n\n\n\u201cWotcher, Moony, just came to see if yo--\u201d\n\n\nHe shut him up with a fierce kiss, crushing their lips together, pulling him at the hips so that they were pressed hard against each other.\n\n\n\u201cOh, ok\u2026\u201d Sirius gasped, when he finally wrenched himself free. He kicked the door shut behind himself as Remus dragged him to the bed.\n\n\nIt was good. Really, really good. Remus\u2019s frustrated urgency was met with answering eagerness from Sirius, and they tore against each other, out of sync in the best possible way. Losing yourself in drink or drugs was nothing compared to losing yourself in Sirius Black. They\u2019d been at this long enough now to know the edges of each others limits, and just how far they could push them.\n\n\n\u201cFuck.\u201d Sirius groaned, when it was all over, and the windows were steamy and the waxing moon had risen outside. Remus reached for his fags once more, still buzzing, his hot skin humming. \u201cFuck.\u201d Sirius said again, on his back, staring up. Beautiful mess. \u201cWhat brought that on?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust you.\u201d Remus replied, exhaling smoke. \u201cJust wanted it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot complaining.\u201d\n\n\nRemus settled back, smoking quietly. This was good. This was better, anyway, than anything else he could be doing. He was still restless, though. A bit more tired, but fidgety and unsettled. He could go again. He could go all night, if it would shut his brain up. That made him glance at the door - they hadn\u2019t shut the curtains, and by some miracle got away with it.\n\n\n\u201cWhere are the others?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm?\u201d Sirius\u2019s eyes had drifted shut, but he stirred awake, valiantly, \u201cOh, er\u2026 Pete\u2019s three rounds into a chess game with a second year who\u2019s obviously some sort of evil mastermind, Mary went to bed, and Prongs and the missus have gone to the prefect\u2019s bathrooms. They thought they were being subtle.\u201d He chuckled lightly under his breath.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to brush my teeth.\u201d Remus said, getting up. In the bathroom, everything came flooding back, and he couldn\u2019t meet his own eyes in the mirror.\n\n\nWhen he came back out, Sirius had woken up a bit, and was sitting up on bed. He smiled at Remus.\n\n\n\u201cHey, I just wanted to check you were ok about Marlene and everything,\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Remus nodded, casually, climbing back in, drawing the curtains closed as he did. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have her back.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm, I hope you\u2019re not worried about--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo we have to talk about that?\u201d Remus crawled towards him, straddling his lap. He began kissing Sirius\u2019s neck, rocking into him slowly.\n\n\n\u201cBlimey, again?\u201d Sirius sounded surprised, but not exactly unhappy about it.\n\n\n\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d Remus replied, taking his wrists and holding them, tight. Such lovely, lovely wrists.\n\n\n\u201cMmm\u2026 well ok, but if you are worried--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up, Black.\u201d Remus growled, pulling back and meeting his eye. Sirius did, biting his lip. Remus smiled. \u201cMuch better. No more talking tonight.\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nIt was a cruel trick, really, exploiting Sirius\u2019s peculiar proclivity for following direct instructions. But it worked, and Remus got his peace, at least that night. The next day was tougher, but lessons and library time became a comfortable barrier between them once again, not to mention the general rabble of friends who accompanied them pretty much everywhere.\n\n\nA wiser, braver man might have used the time to look into himself, to address the feelings of guilt and shame and self-disgust, and maybe make some changes for the better.\n\n\nRemus preferred pretending everything was fine.\n\n\nAnd for a little while anyway, it seemed that Sirius was going to let him. They were still together almost all of the time, and it wasn\u2019t as if they were arguing. If Sirius wondered why Remus\u2019s libido rocketed any time they started to have a private conversation, he didn\u2019t say anything. In the end, he took a different tact.\n\n\nThe weekend before the upcoming full moon, they were walking back up to school from Hogsmeade, and Remus had had to slow down because of his stupid hip, yet again. Sirius and James were chatting ahead, but Christopher hung back to keep Remus company.\n\n\nThey had been to the Three Broomsticks, but the whole big group of them, and Christopher was always too shy to talk much in that sort if situation. So he was taking his chances now.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you liked the book,\u201d he said, hands in his pockets as he walked, \u201cWasn\u2019t it a nice ending?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, great.\u201d Remus puffed, rubbing his hip to try and get it going.\n\n\n\u201cMaurice - the character - reminded me a bit of you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat? Nah.\u201d He was starting to sweat with exertion, despite the cold February air. He wiped his forehead, squinting uphill. Sirius and James were striding ahead, laughing about something together. Christopher followed his eyeline. He pressed his lips together.\n\n\n\u201cAre you and he... ?\u201d He couldn\u2019t find the words, and Remus knew what that was like, so he just gave a straight answer. No need to be coy.\n\n\n\u201cYeah. We are.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Christopher sounded deflated, as if he had still thought it was all a joke at his expense. \u201cWhat\u2019s that like, then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI dunno. Good. Great.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI wish\u2026\u201d he sounded so sad, and he never finished the sentence. After a long time, and more struggling to keep up, Remus touched his shoulder gently.\n\n\n\u201cThere's someone for everyone, Chris.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOi Moony! Come on!\u201d Sirius was yelling. They were almost at school now, Sirius had stopped under the stone arch gateway to wait.\n\n\n\u201cSee you later, ok Remus?\u201d Christopher muttered, hurrying off at a funny little jog. Remus ploughed on, finally reaching the school gate. His hip was screaming at him now, the joints burning, pain shooting up and down his leg. He nodded at Sirius by way of greeting, too out of breath to speak. He leaned against the stone with one arm, hoping Sirius wouldn\u2019t mind waiting a bit longer while he pulled himself together.\n\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d He panted, finally. \u201cHate that fucking hill.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d Sirius asked, giving him a funny look. \u201cSorry, didn\u2019t mean to leave you behind.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d Remus replied, \u201cYou know me, just a bit wonky.\u201d He straightened up, winced, and rubbed his side again.\n\n\n\u201cIs it your hip?\u201d Sirius had his hands on\n\n\nhis\n\n\nhips now, and was giving him an up and down sort of look that was rather like Madam Pomfrey after a bad full moon.\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus shrugged. \u201cs\u2019always been a bit funny.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhen you say \u2018a bit funny\u2019, do you mean that you\u2019re in pain?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cS'just\n\n\nsore.\n\n\n\u201d Remus said, indignant.\n\n\n\u201cSo, pain then.\u201d Sirius raised an eyebrow. Remus hated that superior look. \u201cHow long has it been hurting?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I dunno,\u201d Remus threw his hands up, exasperated - what was the point of this?! \u201cSince I was thirteen.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you joking?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust off and on.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat does Madam Pomfrey say?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh for god\u2019s sake, I don't whinge to her about this sort of crap!\u201d Remus was aware that his voice was getting louder, a few third years walking past turned and looked at him, before running away giggling.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d Sirius folded his arms and tossed his hair, \u201cShe's a nurse, she's supposed to make you feel better. What would you do if I told you I\u2019d been in pain for five years?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you\n\n\non\n\n\nabout??\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nYou\u2019re\n\n\nnot a fucking werew---\u201d He stopped himself just in time. They both looked around themselves furtively, checking no one was listening in. Remus scolded himself. It had been a very long time since he\u2019d let anyone get the better of his temper.\n\n\nSirius leaned forward, glaring at him.\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t deserve to suffer, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d He muttered.\n\n\nThat hurt. He didn\u2019t know why, but it struck Remus so sharply it knocked the breath out of him, and his eyes pricked. He straightened up, careful to remain expressionless this time. He jutted his chin out at Sirius, meeting his glare.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about this any more. Come on, we\u2019ll miss dinner.\u201d And began to stride ahead, biting back against the stabbing in his side."

Sunday was the Gryffindor vs. Ravenclaw quidditch game, so they got away with not speaking much. They both sat together in the stands, cheering when it was appropriate, and booing any time the Ravenclaw\u2019s scored.\n\n\n\u201cAaaand that\u2019s another ten points to Gryffindor!\u201d The commentator called out through the megaphone, \u201cAn overwhelming sixty points now scored by team captain James Potter, no surprises there - fans are starting to wonder what will become of the mighty lions next year when they don\u2019t have their golden boy to depend on--oof, mind that bludger, Simms! \u2026 nicely done! Though I\n\n\nmust\n\n\nsay,\n\n\nI\u2019d\n\n\nhave veered left, but I suppose not everybody is chosen for their dexterity, sometimes it\u2019s just about giving everyone a chance, regardless of ability\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho let Lockhart do the commentary?\u201d Sirius grumbled. \u201cStupid prat doesn\u2019t even know anything about quidditch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe told me he was lined up to play for Puddlemere,\u201d Peter said, \u201cAnd the only reason he never played for Ravenclaw was that his coach said he shouldn\u2019t squander his gift in school games.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re so gullible, Pete,\u201d Remus nudged him, \u201c\n\n\nI\n\n\nknow more about quidditch than that twat.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, and Moony knows about as much about quidditch as you know about judging character.\u201d Sirius added, his voice unnecessarily sharp.\n\n\nRemus coloured. Fine, if Sirius wanted to be passive aggressive.\n\n\n\u201cWell, Padfoot,\u201d he replied, coolly, \u201cIf you want to do it so much, go and ask McGonagall. I think you\u2019d be perfect for the job.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou-what?\u201d Sirius gaped at him. Remus raised an eyebrow,\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah, you\u2019re the only person in this school who chats more shit than Lockhart does.\u201d\n\n\nMary and Lily burst into giggles, covering their mouth. Sirius scowled.\n\n\n\u201cUp yours.\u201d He muttered.\n\n\nThe game ended with 280 points to Gryffindor, but Sirius wasn't cheering.\n\n\nQuidditch matches generally took up most of the day, from an early breakfast listening to James\u2019s pep talks, to the inevitable after party in the common room. Sirius stayed up late, so nobody noticed that they didn\u2019t go to bed together.\n\n\nBy Monday, they were on slightly more civil terms - or at least, neither of them wanted any of their friends to know they\u2019d been fighting. Remus immersed himself in his NEWT revision - if he wasn\u2019t alone in the library, he was extending his group study sessions to run an hour longer than usual, each night. It was the week of the full moon, and he was utterly exhausted, but at least it made getting to sleep easier.\n\n\nAnd he had to avoid Marlene too, of course. He deliberately skipped going to Madam Pomfrey\u2019s Tuesday night healing classes, just in case the subject of werewolves reared its ugly head again. Marlene was the sort of girl who would derail an entire lesson if she thought injustice was being done somewhere.\n\n\nTo Remus\u2019s surprise, Gilderoy Lockhart, the smarmy Ravenclaw commentator, made a guest appearance in his Wednesday revision group. Lockhart was in the year below, and hadn\u2019t crossed the marauder\u2019s radar much so far. He was a bit camp and annoying, prone to laughing too loudly in the dining hall, but that was all Remus knew about him.\n\n\nHe sidled up to Remus, his hair in ridiculous blond bouffant curls. He stank of aftershave, too.\n\n\n\u201cLove this idea,\u201d he gushed, \u201cHelping other students to achieve, really great!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEr, yeah, I s\u2019pose.\u201d Remus replied, shuffling his papers.\n\n\n\u201cThought I\u2019d lend a hand,\u201d Lockhart grinned toothily, \u201cI\u2019m rather a whizz myself, you know. Charms, Transfiguration, Potions - you name it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUm. Great. Cheers.\u201d Remus nodded, \u201cI said I\u2019d go through anti-Giant legislation with the third years today, but have a chat with Chris,\u201d He moved away, quickly, leaving Christopher to deal with it.\n\n\nWednesday was also the second official meeting of the prank-planning group, so Remus and Chris stayed back in the Charms room after study group. Chris had a vaguely dazed expression as they leaned against Flitwick\u2019s desk, waiting.\n\n\n\u201cSorry about that,\u201d Remus offered, lighting up a cigarette as Lockhart swanned out. \u201cI dunno how to deal with him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s fine, he\u2019s in half my classes, so I\u2019m used to it.\u201d Chris replied, still looking a bit disturbed.\n\n\n\u201cWhat did he want?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt took a while to figure out,\u201d Christopher frowned, \u201cHe kept telling me how good he is at everything\u2026 but I think he wanted help with Charms.\u201d\n\n\nRemus snorted disdainfully.\n\n\nThe prank planning session was shorter than the week before - it turned out that no one had had any decent ideas yet. The fourth year Ravenclaws had uncovered some frankly terrifying curses which they were all eager to share, but Lily stepped in, reiterating the rule that nobody ought to get hurt.\n\n\nThey split up again for the journey back to their common rooms, and Remus was faced with a choice between Marlene and Yaz or Sirius and Mary. In the end, he decided it was better the devil he knew, and chose Sirius and Mary. She did most of the talking, which was a relief, and the only awkward moment came when the boys were all back in the dormitory.\n\n\nRemus went over to his own bed, pulling back the duvet.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sleeping there, then?\u201d Sirius asked, out of the blue. Remus frowned, turning to look at him. He hadn\u2019t thought it was up for debate - they were barely speaking to each other, why on earth would they sleep together? And\n\n\nwhy on earth\n\n\ndid Sirius want to call attention to it in front of the others?!\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He nodded, turning back, \u201cFull moon tomorrow. Thought we should all get as much sleep as possible.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, fair enough.\u201d Sirius replied. Remus climbed in and drew his curtains shut, without another word.\n\n\n\u201cEverything ok?\u201d James whispered, very loudly. Sirius grunted a response, and that was that.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThursday 23rd February 1978\n\n\nRemus was more on edge than usual on the day of the full moon. He\u2019d slept badly anyway, thinking about the McKinnons and Sirius and wondering how he was ever going to fix any of it.\n\n\nAt breakfast, it looked as though Marlene had had a difficult night too. Her eyes were rimmed red, and her hair was messier than usual. Yaz and Mary sat either side of her, vying to be the one who comforted her the most.\n\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t stop thinking about him,\u201d Marlene shook her head, staring into her bowl of cornflakes. \u201cI\u2019ve read so many books and accounts, and they all say it hurts a lot\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus stopped eating his own breakfast, and sipped his tea instead, trying to hide his distress.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read that too,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cBut I\u2019m sure that as long as Danny asks for the help he needs he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\n\nRemus tried to ignore this, seething quietly under his collar.\n\n\n\u201cMum\u2019s had to take him to the ministry.\u201d Marlene continued, miserable, \u201cThey have cells there, apparently. We asked if there would be healers present, but no one can tell me\n\n\nanything.\n\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s the best place,\u201d Yaz squeezed her arm, gently.\n\n\nNobody agreed with her. Mary pursed her lips.\n\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve this!\u201d Marlene burst into tears, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve to be locked up alone! He\u2019s my lovely brother, not some\u2026 some\n\n\nanimal\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nThe nausea of guilt threatened to overwhelm Remus, and he left as soon as he could. The rest of the day he could barely concentrate on his lessons. Perverse as it was, ever since the marauders had become animagi, he\u2019d sort of looked forward to full moons at Hogwarts. It had been a while since he\u2019d dreaded one quite so much as this.\n\n\nWhen he arrived at Madam Pomfrey\u2019s office in the evening, he found her frowning her way through a pile of letters. He\u2019d never seen her doing paperwork before.\n\n\n\u201cOh, hello dear,\u201d she smiled at him, tiredly, \u201cShall we get going?\u201d\n\n\nHe nodded, and waited patiently for her to put on her cloak. She saw him staring at the letters. \u201cThey\u2019re from ex-pupils, mostly,\u201d she explained, \u201cOnes who were affected by the attacks. Some of them have family members facing their first full moon, and what to know if I know anything helpful.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to pass on a bit about aftercare, but you and I know how little real information there is,\u201d she continued, as they walked out. Remus remained mute. \u201cI\u2019ve had poor Miss McKinnon here every day, almost. She\u2019s a friend of yours, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Remus\u2019s voice cracked slightly. Madam Pomfrey patted his arm, softly.\n\n\n\u201cIt must be very hard for you, my dear.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know you can always talk to me, if you need to.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d He could hear Sirius\u2019s voice in the back of his head, taunting him,\n\n\nI told you so\u2026\n\n\n\nBut Sirius was wrong. Physical pain was the very least of Remus\u2019s problems, and something he was willing to bear, if he had to. It reminded him what he owed.\n\n\nDespite his apprehension, the full moon was a relief. Remus didn\u2019t even cry out from the pain of transformation, he just let it consume him. As ashamed as it made him, it was good to become something else for a few hours; to relinquish control. The wolf was still on good terms with Padfoot, at least, and they could play and run and hunt without any messy human problems getting in the way.\n\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t to last.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nFriday 24th February 1978\n\n\nThe routine was standard by now. Remus transformed back, the others checked he was ok, then left, Madam Pomfrey came to collect him, he spent the morning under a sleeping draught, woke up in time for lunch, then headed back to his own bed in the afternoon.\n\n\nMore recently, Sirius had been coming to collect him from the infirmary, if his timetable allowed for it. (And, actually, even when his timetable didn\u2019t allow for it - Sirius took any excuse to bunk off.) Of course, given the way Remus had been acting, he didn\u2019t expect Sirius to come that day.\n\n\nBut Sirius was always full of surprises.\n\n\n\u201cBrought you a frog,\u201d he said, waiting patiently as Remus finished tying his laces. He handed over a chocolate frog box, which Remus accepted. His temper had cooled quite a bit; perhaps a good long sleep had been all he needed.\n\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan we be ok, again?\u201d Sirius asked, sounding genuinely sorry. \u201cCan we both just admit we said some stupid stuff, but it\u2019s over, now?\u201d\n\n\nRemus looked at him for a long time, letting him stew a little bit. Then he smiled,\n\n\n\u201cYeah, go on then.\u201d\n\n\nThey walked back to the tower quite happily, though Remus was pushing himself a bit harder than normal, trying not to limp or show any trace of discomfort.\n\n\n\u201cIs Marlene ok?\u201d Remus asked, as they neared the common room.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, think so,\u201d Sirius nodded, \u201cShe got a letter from her mum this morning, saying Danny\u2019s ok. Cried a bit, but she\u2019s less of a state now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood. That\u2019s good.\u201d\n\n\nThey pushed through the portrait hole and walked through the common room.\n\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll go straight to bed for a bit,\u201d Remus said, making for the dorm. \u201cIf that\u2019s ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Sirius nodded, over polite, as they headed up yet another flight of stairs. Remus was seriously struggling now, but he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d let Sirius see it.\n\n\n\u201cYou tired?\u201d Remus asked.\n\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cSlept all morning. Peter too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh good.\u201d Remus finally reached his bed and sat down. Without even thinking, his hand went to rub his hip. He stopped as soon as he realised, but \u00a0Sirius\u2019s eyes zeroed in on it at once. He looked Remus in the eye reproachfully.\n\n\n\u201cDid you speak to Madam Pomfrey?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe had a lovely chat, thanks.\u201d Remus stiffened, defences back up, \u201cAbout all her poor ex-students who had to transform for the first time last night. It was really cheery.\u201d\n\n\nSirius tutted.\n\n\n\u201cBut did you talk to her about your hip?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus huffed, lying down.\n\n\n\u201cRemus, stop being difficult! You see her every week! Just\n\n\nmention\n\n\nto her-- I mean,\n\n\nI\u2019ll\n\n\ndo it, if you want me to.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJesus Christ, not this again! Leave me alone!\u201d Remus sat up again.\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Sirius retorted, just as viciously, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you won\u2019t tell her about it, I\u2019m sure she could help.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh my god, why can\u2019t you just drop it? I said I don\u2019t want to bother her with crap like this. You\u2019re making such a big fuss over nothing!\u201d Remus was on his feet now, the wolf inside him wanting the higher ground; asserting dominance.\n\n\n\u201cAnd\n\n\nyou\u2019re\n\n\navoiding your problems again!\u201d Sirius raged, \u201cYou always do this and it\u2019s so bloody exhausting! You think you\u2019re being so mature, do you? Keeping everything bottled up. It\u2019s stupid! You\u2019re just making a martyr of yourself, it\u2019s like you\n\n\nwant\n\n\nto be miserable.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, get fucked, Black!\u201d Remus shouted back. \u201cEasy for you to have a go, isn\u2019t it?! Why do we always have to talk about\n\n\nmy\n\n\nshit life, hm?! Mr \u2018tell me a fucking secret\u2019?!\u201d\n\n\nSirius blinked, shocked, and Remus was elated; he had something now. He had Sirius in his jaws, he wasn\u2019t letting go until he tasted blood. \u201cWhat about\n\n\nyou\n\n\n, Sirius?! How come we never get to talk about\n\n\nyour\n\n\nfucked up family, with your death eater brother and your insane cousin?! Why don\u2019t we talk about\n\n\nyour\n\n\npain, and\n\n\nyour\n\n\nscars for a little while, see how that feels.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus, for fuck\u2019s sake--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I know! Why don\u2019t we talk about your\n\n\nmother\n\n\n?\u201d Remus went in for the kill, and it was more effective than even he had expected. Sirius changed completely; his expression froze, his posture tensed, as if he\u2019d been punched in the gut.\n\n\nRemus almost wished he had punched him, because then at least Sirius could just punch him back, and they could have a fair fight, and that would be it. But that hadn\u2019t been fair, and \u00a0he couldn\u2019t take it back.\n\n\nSirius gave him a look of utter hurt and shock, before turning quickly to anger.\n\n\n\u201cGo fuck yourself, Lupin.\u201d He spat, storming out.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, piss off, then!\u201d Remus shouted as the door slammed.\n\n\nHe was breathing hard, and his face was very hot. He wished Sirius would come back and shout at him a bit more, so he could shout back, but he settled for chain smoking and The Sex Pistols. Fuck everybody.\n\n\nSirius did not return, and Remus didn\u2019t know where the map was, so he couldn\u2019t look for him.\n\n\nEventually, the dorm room door did open again, and Lily and James came in, very close together and whispering happily,\n\n\n\u201cOh, hiya Moony!\u201d James stopped as he caught sight of Remus brooding by the window. He looked a bit sheepish, \u201cSorry, we thought you\u2019d be in the hospital wing, still.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo. She lets me go after lunch, normally.\u201d Remus replied, monotone. He got up, \u201cI\u2019ll get out of your way.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, no, Remus, don\u2019t!\u201d! Lily said, flustered, \u201cWe just came up here for the quiet.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Remus raised a sarcastic eyebrow, and Lily and James blushed, looking away.\n\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Padfoot?\u201d James went over to sit on his bed.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know. Don\u2019t care.\u201d Remus withdrew another cigarette from his matchbox and lit it with the end of the last one.\n\n\n\u201cAre you\u2026 having a fight?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLook, stay out of it, Potter.\u201d Remus snarled.\n\n\nJames recoiled, and looked at Lily, who shrugged back at him.\n\n\nAt that very moment, as if it had been summoned just to break the tension, an owl flew in the open window, surprising all three of them. It was from the Potters, and James retrieved two letters tied to its leg. He glanced down at one and held it out to Remus.\n\n\n\u201cFor you, Moony.\u201d\n\n\nClicking his tongue irritably, Remus got up off the sill and went to snatch it from James\u2019s outstretched hand. He opened it, skimming the brief note from Mrs Potter, who had been so kindly forwarding all of his correspondence.\n\n\nHe expected another postcard from Grant, but it was a neatly folded envelope. He didn\u2019t recognise the tidy, blue ink handwriting, but it had a muggle stamp.\n\n\nHe looked down at the return address, written in tiny script on the back.\n\n\n\nIf undelivered, please return to\n\n\n\n:\n\n\n\n\nMs Hope Jenkins, Sparrow Ward, Cardiff City Hospital, Cardiff."

Yelping with pain, he leapt up, patting wildly at the hot patch on his thigh.\n\n\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Lily stared at him, alarmed, \u201cAre you ok?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah\u2026\u201d He picked up the cigarette and tossed it out of the window. He\u2019d scrunched up the little envelope in his other hand. He stuffed the crumpled paper into his pocket. \u201cJust\u2026 nipping to the loo.\u201d\n\n\nHe hurried into the little bathroom and slammed the door shut, trying to regulate his breathing a bit. Ok. Ok. He ought to have expected this. He was the one who\u2019d written to\n\n\nher\n\n\n, after all.\n\n\nRemus pulled the letter out of his pocket and smoothed it out. He couldn\u2019t have opened it in front of Lily and James; it might say anything, and he was so unprepared. He bit his lip. He wanted another cigarette, badly, but he\u2019d just chucked the last one out of the window. Typical.\n\n\nHe peeled open the envelope slowly, taking care not to tear it, as if that might mean something. The paper was tissue-thin, and he unfolded it gently. The handwriting was more recogniseable now. He knew it from the original letter, written all those years ago, except now it was more spindly; noticeably crooked, as though the hand had been shaking.\n\n\n\n\nDear Remus,\n\n\n\n\nI am sorry it has taken me so long to reply to you. I am afraid I have been unwell, and I have not been at home to receive post.\n\n\n\n\nI was so happy to hear from you. I am sorry I cannot write more, my darling, but I would love to hear how you are getting on. Please write again, to the address below.\n\n\n\n\nLove Mum.\n\n\n\n\nRemus\u2019s own hands were shaking now. \u2018\n\n\nLove Mum\n\n\n.\u2019 What the fuck did that mean?!\n\n\nHe felt rage creeping up on him, ready to swallow him whole. The spat with Sirius faded into insignificance; now he was truly furious. It was an anger that had lain dormant for a long time now, but it had always been there, in the core of him. An anger that had no direction, no purpose other than filling him up with red hot mania. Maybe Greyback had put it there. Maybe Hope\u2019s abandonment had. Right now he didn\u2019t give a shit.\n\n\nUnable to control himself, he kicked the bathroom door. He kicked it so hard that he splintered the wood, cracking it right through.\n\n\n\u201cFuck.\u201d He muttered. \u201cOw.\u201d He hoped he hadn\u2019t broken a toe.\n\n\n\u201cOh my god, Remus?!\u201d Lily\u2019s voice sang out again.\n\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d He said, almost on instinct, as he wrenched his foot free from the door. He unlocked it.\n\n\nJames was standing right there, his eyes big and wide, Lily just behind him, as if he was shielding her from Remus.\n\n\n\u201cWhat the bloody hell are you playing at?!\u201d James said, his voice hard. \u201cLook, if you\u2019re having a tiff with Padfoot then sort it out between you, don\u2019t start tearing our room apart!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Remus said again, feeling quite small. He\u2019d never been told off by James before; it was scarier than he\u2019d expected.\n\n\n\u201cRemus?\u201d Lily pushed her boyfriend aside, impatiently, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\n\nHe shook his head, looking down at the letter in his hands. His shoulders slumped. He was still breathing too hard to be able to speak. He handed it to her.\n\n\nLily gave him a quizzical look, but took the paper from him. As she read it, her eyes grew bigger and her mouth dropped open. James read it over her shoulder, and soon enough their expressions matched. Remus couldn\u2019t seem to get his breathing under control; he wasn\u2019t quite sure what was happening. His chest grew very tight, as if all the air had been sucked out of the room. He suddenly felt very hot and very dizzy, and he was seeing stars.\n\n\nHe stumbled, clutching the door frame for dear life.\n\n\n\u201cRemus?!\u201d Lily\u2019s voice came to him in an echo, as if he was at the bottom of a deep well. Her soft hands were on his shoulders, and she guided him down towards the floor - which was a good thing, because his legs had just decided to give up. She started rubbing his back slowly, and was speaking very calmly, \u201cDeep breaths, Remus, do you hear me? In through your mouth, then out through your nose, ok? With me; one\u2026 two\u2026 three\u2026\u201d\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t know what sort of magic that was, but it started to work, and after ten deep breaths he began to feel normal again. His vision clearing, he looked up. Lily was sitting beside him on the dusty bedroom floor. James was standing over them, looking worried. He had the letter.\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Remus said, still short of breath, \u201cSorry, I dunno what happened there.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy sister has funny turns like that all the time, when she gets anxious,\u201d Lily explained. \u201cGot anything sweet? She normally has a biscuit after the worst has passed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUm\u2026 yeah.\u201d Remus delved into his pocket for the chocolate frog Sirius had given him earlier. He unwrapped it and bit the head off, quickly. His mouth filled with rich sweetness, and he really did feel much better.\n\n\nHe tried to get up, and James immediately offered a steady arm to help,\n\n\n\u201cSorry I had a go, Moony,\u201d he said, still sounding very worried, \u201cI was a right dick.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I shouldn\u2019t have broken the door\u2026\u201d Remus replied, carefully brushing his trousers down and walking to his bed to sit.\n\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s nothing,\u201d Lily got up and withdrew her wand, \u201c\n\n\nReparo\n\n\n. See?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan I have the letter back?\u201d Remus asked, weakly.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, sorry!\u201d James hurried to pass it back. Remus read it again. His stomach tightened, but he didn\u2019t get dizzy again.\n\n\nLove Mum\n\n\n. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d sent her a letter.\u201d James said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you even knew where she was.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYour parents helped me.\u201d Remus said, still re-reading. \u201cI only told Sirius about it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, love,\u201d Lily came to sit by him, she squeezed his hand. \u201cAre you going to write back?\u201d\n\n\nRemus looked up, staring ahead. He made a decision.\n\n\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to see her.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Lily squeaked, \u201cYes, of course\u2026 er\u2026 I bet McGonagall would help you arrange it for the weekend, maybe--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m going right now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d James said.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve waited long enough.\u201d Remus said. \u201cI\u2019ve got the address. I\u2019m going.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus, don\u2019t you want to just have a think--\u201d Lily started.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus said, pulling his hand away from her.\n\n\nHis hand brushed against the cigarette burn in his leg. Bugger. Where was he going to get another pair? Better try a mending spell once he\u2019d calmed down a bit. He got up and went to his his trunk to find a clean pair of trousers. Couldn\u2019t meet his mother with cigarette burns on his clothes, could he?\n\n\n\u201cNo thinking.\u201d He said to Lily. \u201cShe\u2019s in a hospital, god knows why, but I might not have long.\u201d\n\n\nHe undressed without even thinking. Lily looked away, quickly, blushing, but he didn't care. \u201cProngs,\u201d he said, \u201cCan I have your cloak?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d James nodded, without hesitation.\n\n\n\u201cThanks. I\u2019m going to try and apparate from Honeyduke\u2019s, I think. Shouldn\u2019t be gone all night, I can be back before curfew, I bet.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood plan.\u201d James nodded.\n\n\n\u201cHow are you going to get to Honeyduke\u2019s?!\u201d Lily asked, looking very confused. Remus looked at James, curiously. The other boy gave a sheepish chuckle and pushed his glasses up his nose.\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 there's sort of a secret passageway\u2026\u201d\n\n\nLess than half an hour later, they had passed the hunchbacked witch statue and were about to begin the journey to Hogsmeade. They\u2019d hurriedly dressed in muggle clothes, something Lily had suggested almost at the very last minute. James had wanted to tell Sirius and Peter, but Remus refused. Peter couldn\u2019t apparate anyway, and Remus didn\u2019t have room for Sirius in his head right now. Luckily, James respected this reasoning.\n\n\n\u201cHow many\n\n\nmore\n\n\nsecrets do you lot have?!\u201d Lily was whispering, staring about her as they progressed along the dark tunnel.\n\n\n\u201cDoes she know about the map?\u201d Remus asked, innocently.\n\n\n\u201cWhat map?! Potter! What map??\u201d\n\n\nThey weren\u2019t really fighting. It was just part of the fun, for Lily and James, all the bickering. They\u2019d spent so many years doing it already they just didn\u2019t know how to stop. Remus liked it. It kept his mind off everything else.\n\n\nBecause he\u2019d calmed down now, and the rational thoughts were starting to creep back in.\n\n\nWhere are you going? Why would you think she wants to see you, after all these years? You\u2019ll get caught out of bounds and expelled, and you\u2019ll drag Lily and James down with you\n\n\n.\n\n\nAnd Sirius. He wanted more than anything to have Sirius nearby, if only they weren\u2019t fighting. Perhaps he\u2019d brought this all on himself, invoking Sirius\u2019s mother like that. Oh god, what if Hope was like Walpurga?!\n\n\nBut he pressed on, because he\u2019d come this far now. Soon enough they were in the cellar of Honeyduke\u2019s and all memorising the hospital address, preparing to apparate.\n\n\nThat part was easy. Remus was so full of emotions and adrenaline that he barely had to turn his head and he was whooshing through space, following the current of magic towards Cardiff. Lily and James landed moments later, holding hands.\n\n\n\u201cThis is Wales, then,\u201d Lily said, looking around at the quiet city street they found themselves on. \u201cNever been before.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMe neither.\u201d James and Remus replied in unison.\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s look for the hospital, then,\u201d she smiled. She dropped James\u2019s hand and took Remus\u2019s instead, half leading him to the end of the road.\n\n\nThey\u2019d overshot by only a street or two. The main building was ornate, old and red brick, the rest of it \u201860s grey concrete. It had that cold institutional atmosphere which reminded Remus too much of St Edmund\u2019s.\n\n\n\u201cRight!\u201d Lily said, brightly, facing a large map of the building, beneath a signpost pointing in various directions. \u201cIt was Sparrow ward, wasn\u2019t it\u2026 so that's\u2026 over there.\u201d\n\n\nShe set off again, and Remus was so, so glad she was there, because everything in him was telling him to run away and never look back. Sparrow was in one of the concrete blocks. They stopped just outside.\n\n\n\u201cUm\u2026 Lily? James?\u201d Remus said, holding them back. \u201cDo you mind\u2026 not coming with me? I just\u2026 I want to do it by myself. Sorry.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Lily said, patting his shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait right here, right James?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk.\u201d James nodded, carefully, \u201cMoony, are you sure you don\u2019t want me to get--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t come.\u201d Remus said, with absolute certainty. \u201cYou were right, we did have a fight. I was awful to him, I said some really shitty stuff. He\u2019s angry and he's got a right to be.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, but still--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt's fine, Prongs.\u201d Remus assured him, \u201cI\u2019m fine. Ok, I\u2019m going in now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood luck!\u201d Lily smiled. He nodded, grimly, and approached the revolving doors.\n\n\nInside the hospital there were signs pointing in all sorts of directions, and three times Remus had to go back on himself because he\u2019d taken a wrong turn, or got in the wrong lift somewhere. It was an awful place; it stank of sickness and piss and disinfectant masking blood and death. Remus\u2019s nerve was weakening by the minute.\n\n\nFinally, he passed through a set of double doors with \u2018Sparrow\u2019 printed neatly above in blue and white. It led to a quieter corridor, with a nurses station at the end and lots of light open rooms with neat rows of people lying in beds.\n\n\nRemus shuffled along to the nurses station, trying to get a look at the names of the patients listed on the wall behind.\n\n\n\u201cWho\u2019re you looking for, lovie?\u201d A plump nurse asked him with a pleasant smile.\n\n\n\u201cUm. Hope Jenkins\u2026\u201d Remus mumbled.\n\n\n\u201cAh! Relative, are you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m her son.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, she\u2019ll be so pleased! She talks about her kids all the time, does Hope. Just follow me, pet.\u201d\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t have time to be stunned by this latest revelation that his mother had \u2018kids\u2019, plural. Speechless, Remus followed the nurse down the squeaky green lino corridor, onto a ward with six or eight beds in it. She led him to the far window, where light poured in. \u201cHope, my love, you\u2019ve got a visitor! Your boy\u2019s come up to see you, isn\u2019t that nice?\u201d\n\n\nThe nurse ushered him in, and he stood at the end of the bed, helplessly. The woman lying in the bed looked as though she had been dozing, though she was propped up in a half-sitting position. She was blinking now, disoriented, and frowned slightly at the nurse.\n\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d She spoke in a quiet, hoarse voice, still confused until her dark eyes landed on Remus. Her pale eyebrows shot up. \u201cOh.\u201d She said.\n\n\n\u201cHello.\u201d He waved, feeling stupid.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you two some privacy,\u201d the nurse was saying now, drawing the pale hospital curtains around the bed, \u201cCan I get anyone a cup of tea?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo thank you.\u201d They both replied, still staring at each other.\n\n\nShe was very small, and very frail. Skeletal, even; her bones and tendons showing through the skin. She looked much older than Remus had imagined; but perhaps that was just the illness. Her face was sunken, and had a morbid, skull-like quality. He remembered how lovely she\u2019d looked in her photograph, and how pretty she might still be, if she was well.\n\n\nMore alert now, her watery black eyes stared up at him, with an almost greedy glint; as if she was absorbing every inch of his gangly frame. He stood still, and let her.\n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she whispered, hoarsely. Her eyes filled with tears. \u201cOh, you look just like him.\u201d\n\n\nSo this was his mother. He looked down at her and felt nothing at all.\n\n\nHe cleared his throat,\n\n\n\u201cI got your letter.\u201d He didn\u2019t know what else to say. He wished he hadn\u2019t come at all.\n\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to come.\u201d She replied, softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t dare ask you to. But I did want to see you. I\u2019ve wanted to see you\u2026 for years.\u201d She closed her eyes and the tears ran tracks down her thin face.\n\n\nHe bit his tongue. All sorts of foul, nasty things boiled in his throat, wanting to be spoken. But what use was it? She was clearly dying, he could smell it on her. Angry words would make no difference. She spoke again. \u201cYou\u2019re at Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he nodded. \u201cFinal year.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d be so pleased. Lyall. Your father.\u201d\n\n\nSilence again. Remus didn\u2019t want to look at her for too long. She looked so sad, so very weak and sick. \u201cIs there anything you want to ask me?\u201d\n\n\nRemus shrugged. This was more horrible than he could have imagined. She laughed, softly,\n\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t hurt my feelings, you know. This might be your only chance.\u201d\n\n\nShe swallowed, when he still did not speak. \u201cAll right then, I\u2019ll just tell you. I\u2019m sorry for what I did. I\u2019m not proud. I loved your father more than\u2026 well, I loved him with all of my heart. He was everything to me, I wish you could have known him. When you were hurt, and he died\u2026 I just didn\u2019t know what to do. I was so young, I was alone. I hadn\u2019t seen my own family in years, and I didn\u2019t even know the neighbours because Lyall said we had to keep things secret.\u201d\n\n\nShe was Welsh, he recognised the accent now. \u00a0The way she spoke his father\u2019s name in two gentle syllables -\n\n\nLy-all.\n\n\nHe felt stupid for not realising, seeing as they were in Cardiff, but still. No one had ever told him she was Welsh. He supposed it wasn\u2019t pertinent information to anyone but him.\n\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, you don\u2019t have to explain.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought about you,\u201d she said, desperately, \u201cEvery day. My boy, my poor little boy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He said, feeling uncomfortable - frightened, even. \u201cIt\u2019s ok, please don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\n\nHe sat down in the stiff backed hospital chair beside her. He didn\u2019t reach for her, or hold her hand, that felt like too much.\n\n\n\u201cI thought it was the best thing,\u201d she wept, the tears tickling down into the pillow she lay on, \u201cI couldn\u2019t have looked after you, you were so strong, even when you were that small. I had to lock you up, you were so frightened and you were crying for me and I couldn\u2019t go in\u2026\u201d\n\n\nHe felt as if a heavy block of ice had settled in the pit of his stomach. He just wanted her to stop talking, he didn\u2019t want to hear this,\n\n\n\u201cYou did the right thing.\u201d He said, \u201cYou did. You did everything you could, I never blamed you.\u201d\n\n\nThat was true. He\u2019d blamed his father over and over again in his head, hated him fiercely for years. But he had somehow felt more sympathy for his mother, a muggle who was left just as much at sea by Lyall\u2019s death as he was.\n\n\n\u201cDoes it still\u2026 happen?\u201d She asked, her eyes big. They were the same greeny brown as his own. He nodded,\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad,\u201d he lied, \u201cI have help. It\u2019s safer.\u201d\n\n\nShe looked relieved, which made him happy.\n\n\n\u201cAnd school? I bet you\u2019re as clever as your dad!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI like school,\u201d he said, \u201cI do pretty well.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure what else to say about it, \u201cI er\u2026 I have his wand. Lyall\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\nShe smiled, paper white thin stretching over her hollow face, like a skull.\n\n\n\u201cAnd do you\u2026 have someone? In your life, looking after you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d He thought Lily and James, and Peter and Grant, and Madam Pomfrey, and Mary and Marlene, and even Professor McGonagall. And Sirius. \u201cYeah, I do. I have friends.\u201d\n\n\nHe glanced at the record player on her bedside table, and the little pile of records on the chair. The Beatles, Cliff Richard, The Kinks. \u201cAre these yours?\u201d He asked, genuinely curious for the first time.\n\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d she nodded, \u201cLove a bit of a dance, I do. Lyall was the reader, but I\u2019m happiest with a nice pop song. He used to tease me.\u201d\n\n\nHer accent was lovely, a sweet, friendly up and down. He was glad she wasn\u2019t posh; he hoped he didn\u2019t sound too common for her.\n\n\n\u201cI like music too.\u201d He said, softly. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to raise his voice, but she didn\u2019t mind. \u201cDavid Bowie, mostly.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou must take after me,\u201d she said, sleepily, still smiling. \u201cMy bouncy little boy. I used to set you down on the rug while I did the housework, and play my records and you\u2019d jump around on your bottom and wriggle like you were dancing.\n\n\nLove Me Do\n\n\nwas playing on the radio when you took your first steps.\u201d\n\n\nShe\u2019d grown tearful, saying all this, her eyes had welled up.\n\n\n\u201cI think I remember,\u201d he said, quickly \u2013 it was a lie, but it would make her happy. He didn\u2019t want her to be this sad, not for his sake. Without thinking, he reached out and took her hand, gently, as if she might shatter. It was a very little hand \u2013 she was a very little woman. \u201cI love the Beatles,\u201d he said, \u201cAlways have.\u201d\n\n\nShe beamed. Even through the hollow cheeks and dark eyes of her illness, she had a lovely smile. Hope squeezed her son\u2019s hand and smiled up at him, and they were comfortable like that for quite some time. Remus felt the stirring of something towards her \u2013 something warm and old and familiar.\n\n\nEventually he offered to put some music on for her.\n\n\n\u201cOh, the player\u2019s broken.\u201d She replied.\n\n\n\u201cReally? Let me see\u2026\u201d Remus fumbled in his pocket for his wand, and gave the black wooden box a tap. He did it without letting go of her hand, and she made a small sound of delight and pride, seeing him use magic.\n\n\nThe record began to turn, and the sound which came out was clear and lovely. It was a Fairport Convention record; Remus had never bothered with them much before; too hippie for him. But she smiled as Sandy Denny\u2019s larksong voice began to fill the room. So he listened.\n\n\n\nAcross the evening sky, all the birds are leaving\n\n\n\n\nBut how can they know it's time for them to go?\n\n\n\n\nBefore the winter fire, I will still be dreaming.\n\n\n\n\nI have no thought of time.\n\n\n\n\nFor who knows where the time goes?\n\n\n\n\nWho knows where the time goes?\n\n\n\n\nThey both sat listening quietly to the music, and Remus saw that he got some of his shyness from her, maybe. She never held eye contact too long, and never pushed him into talking. Remus had a sense that they could sit in contented silence like that for hours, and understand each other just as well as if they\u2019d done nothing but talk.\n\n\nIn a little while, the nurse came back. It was already after visiting hours, she said, and Matron would be on her case. Remus didn\u2019t want to go, and Hope didn\u2019t want him to leave.\n\n\n\u201cWill you come back?\u201d She pleaded, turning weepy again.\n\n\n\u201cI will.\u201d He promised. \u201cAs soon as I can, I will.\u201d\n\n\nShe pulled his hand to her lips. She was very weak, but he let her. She kissed his scarred knuckles.\n\n\n\u201cI love you, my darling.\u201d\n\n\nSomething inside him broke when he realised he couldn\u2019t say it back. He didn\u2019t know how to say it and mean it.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d He promised again, hoping she didn\u2019t mind too much.\n\n\nHe left the room in a daze, and it was a miracle he managed to get out of the hospital at all. It must have taken twice as long as it took him to get in.\n\n\nOutside, it had grown dark. Lily was sitting on a bench, with a big black dog at her side. She stood up, the street light behind her illuminating her hair, seeming to set it alight; a halogen halo.\n\n\n\u201cAlright, Moony?\u201d She asked, eyes serious.\n\n\nHe shrugged, speechless. Instantly, Lily stepped forward and wound her arms around his waist, laying her head against his chest and squeezing. He wrapped his arms around her, gratefully, and hugged her back, bowing his head to inhale the lovely apple skin smell of her. He was crying, and Sirius was right there, but he didn\u2019t care, he just let Lily keep squeezing him, feeling as if she was holding him together. He could hear Padfoot whining and panting. Finally, he broke away, rubbing his eyes.\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, bashfully.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d she squeezed his arm, her own sea green eyes shimmering. \u201cWant to go home?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cActually,\u201d Remus sniffed, \u201cI want to get really, really pissed.\u201d\n\n\nPadfoot barked."

Pub, then?\u201d Lily said, business-like once more. \u201cI think we\u2019d better go back to Hogsmeade, don\u2019t you? I don\u2019t fancy our chances apparating back to Scotland drunk\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, good plan,\u201d Remus nodded, wiping his nose on his sleeve, still sniffing. \u201c...where\u2019s James?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell we realised that it was going to look really suspicious if both the head boy and the head girl were missing,\u201d Lily laughed. \u201cSo he went back to cover for us. He um\u2026 he sent Sirius. We both thought\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d Remus nodded. He finally turned to address the dog, sitting patiently by. \u201cSirius?\u201d\n\n\nHe transformed back at once, and stood there looking awkward, rubbing one arm with the other.\n\n\n\u201cHello, Moony.\u201d He said, softly.\n\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d Remus nodded back, suddenly very shy.\n\n\n\u201cOh, Remus, I forgot!\u201d Lily broke the atmosphere. She handed him a small square cardboard box. A carton of Silk Cut. \u201cJames\u2019s idea,\u201d she shrugged.\n\n\n\u201cLife saver, thanks!\u201d Remus accepted them gratefully.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d better go and get in touch with him, actually,\u201d Lily continued, glancing between the two boys, \u201cBlack, give me the mirror? I\u2019ll go and let him know where to meet us.\u201d\n\n\nSirius handed her the compact, and she smiled at them both, before walking a little ways away - so that she was just out of earshot.\n\n\nRemus sat down on the bench, opening the box of fags with his teeth, then pulling one out. He held it up to Sirius,\n\n\n\u201cLight it for me? I\u2019m so nervy it\u2019ll probably blow up in my face.\u201d\n\n\nSirius clicked his fingers, and the cylinder lit. Remus sucked on it appreciatively. Sirius sat next to him.\n\n\n\u201cMoony I\u2019m--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSirius--\u201d\n\n\nThey both tried to speak at once, then smiled at each other timidly.\n\n\n\u201cSirius.\u201d Remus said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was a twat.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou were.\u201d Sirius nodded, taking a cigarette of his own. \u201cBut you weren\u2019t completely wrong.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNor were you.\u201d Remus sighed. \u201cI dunno what\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s\n\n\nnothing\n\n\nwrong with you, Remus.\u201d Sirius touched his knee, gently, looking him in the eye. He was in muggle clothes, which was a nice change, Remus thought. Black jeans and his black leather jacket. Remus smiled.\n\n\n\u201cYou look really good.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo what else is new.\u201d Sirius stuck out his tongue. He turned solemn again, \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it when Prongs told me about the letter. I felt like shit for shouting at you, I just wanted to make sure you were ok, then he said you\u2019d gone...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Remus replied. \u201cI just had to get here straight away, I didn\u2019t even think.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have, either.\u201d Sirius admitted. \u201cThough, actually, I dunno if I would exactly rush to my mother\u2019s bedside.\u201d\n\n\nRemus snorted, half-heartedly, and they were both quiet for a bit, thinking about their mothers.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s she like?\u201d Sirius asked, finally.\n\n\nRemus considered this carefully before answering. He tried to recall her voice, her eyes, the way her hand felt in his.\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s nice.\u201d He said. \u201cI think I like her.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAll right, you two, ready?\u201d Lily returned, obviously having judged them suitably made up.\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d they both replied, smiling.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThey ended up in the Three Broomsticks, all five of them - James had brought Peter down from the castle with him. Three fire whiskies in and Remus was feeling pleasantly warm and loose, grinning dopily as his friends made a racket for his benefit.\n\n\nNo one asked him any questions, which was perfect; they just drank, and laughed and talked like real teenagers for once.\n\n\n\u201cThis map is some of the best magic I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Lily marvelled, after studying it for some time. \u201cAnd you\n\n\nonly\n\n\nuse it for pranks?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat else would we use it for?\u201d Sirius raised an eyebrow.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve even got the moving staircases!\u201d Lily exclaimed, clearly delighted.\n\n\n\u201cThat was one of mine.\u201d Remus said, eagerly.\n\n\n\u201cIt was\n\n\nall\n\n\nyours,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cThe whole thing was your idea, Mr Moony.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, but you lot did loads of work on it\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with it at the end of the year?\u201d Lily asked.\n\n\nThe four boys looked at each other with a note of sadness. The map would no longer be useful to them, if they weren't at Hogwarts. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs would no longer be Hogwarts\u2019 premiere mischief makers. James shrugged,\n\n\n\u201cPass it on, I s\u2019pose? Maybe to someone in the co-operative.\u201d\n\n\nRemus hated that idea, and finished his fourth drink.\n\n\n\u201cRosmerta!\u201d Sirius called out, raising a hand, \u201cAnother round, darling?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight you are my love\u2026\u201d she called back.\n\n\n\u201cFlirt.\u201d Remus nudged him under the table.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to get\n\n\nyou\n\n\ndrunk.\u201d Sirius replied, piously, \u201cAs requested.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m already drunk,\u201d Lily slurred, blinking hard. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to walk back to school\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll carry you.\u201d James said, valiantly, though he was clearly starting to get a bit wobbly himself.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it to be over.\u201d Peter said, morosely.\n\n\n\u201cCalm down Wormy, we\u2019re not going back yet.\u201d Sirius said, as Rosmerta appeared with a tray of drinks. Remus grabbed another firewhisky and knocked it back. He liked the burn; it felt like it was working.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean tonight.\u201d Peter said, clumsily slamming his chubby fist on the table, \u201cI mean school, I mean\n\n\neverything\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSchool isn\u2019t everything.\u201d Lily patted him gently.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d He sighed, \u201cBut it\u2019s all going to change, isn\u2019t it? We won\u2019t see each other all the time, we\u2019ll all have jobs.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSpeak for yourself,\u201d Sirius laughed, \u201cSome of us are independently wealthy. Anyway, of course we\u2019ll see each other every day, idiot, we\u2019re all moving in together!\u201d\n\n\nLily and James looked at each other, suddenly sober. Sirius's eyes narrowed, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMate,\u201d James said, awkwardly, \u201cEr. Lily and I have been talking about\u2026 maybe getting a flat together, after the summer.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius nodded, \u201cWe\u2019ll all move in, and--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPadfoot,\u201d Remus touched his knee, \u201cHe means just the two of them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\n\n\nWhy\n\n\n?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this now!\u201d Lily said, hurriedly, \u201cNothing\u2019s decided!\u201d\n\n\nBut everyone could see that it was.\n\n\n\u201cWhat about this prank, then?\u201d James said, still eyeing Sirius, \u201cWhat are we going to do if no one comes up with anything good?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe will,\u201d Remus said, \u201cThere\u2019s time. Is it me or is the mass-levitation idea starting to sound good?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh good, you\n\n\nare\n\n\ndrunk.\u201d Sirius smirked, \u201cHow the fuck are we supposed to levitate two hundred students? And\n\n\nwhy\n\n\nwould we?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBe funny.\u201d Remus shrugged, then giggled. Everything seemed like it would be funny, right then.\n\n\n\u201cThere are enough of us,\u201d James said, \u201cIf everyone concentrates, we could easily levitate them all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd do what with them?! Practical jokes need a practical element!\u201d Sirius insisted. Everyone else burst out laughing at him. He shook his head disdainfully and took a swig of his butterbeer.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not drinking?\u201d Remus said, suddenly.\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 no.\u201d Sirius looked down, self consciously. \u201cThought someone better stay responsible enough to get you lot back in one piece.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAhhh,\u201d Lily grinned dopily, \u201cYou\n\n\ndo\n\n\ncare, Black! You\u2019re all soft and sensitive really, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want anyone expelled before we can get this prank off the ground!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOff the ground! So you agree with the levitation idea!\u201d James cackled.\n\n\n\u201cOh for goodness\u2019 sake\u2026\u201d Sirius rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to the loo.\u201d He got up and left them laughing.\n\n\nRemus took the opportunity to pop out for a cigarette. He could have smoked in the pub, and thought that Lily and James might even let him get away with it, but he wanted a minute to himself. Outside was nice and cool, the air felt clean. He lit up and started puffing away, wrapping his arms around himself against the chill. He was really drunk. He had to lean against the wall just to stay up. It was nice; he didn\u2019t have to worry about anything if he was drunk. No one would expect him to.\n\n\nHe leaned his head back against the wall, catching sight of the pale crescent moon glowing through the scudding clouds. He thought about Livia, as he often did when he saw the moon. And Castor. He thought about their warning, and how it had been so meaningless, in the end. Why was that? Remus\u2019s whisky addled mind hit on something - something he hadn\u2019t thought about before. But as soon as it was there, it was gone again. He shook his head, dazedly.\n\n\n\u201cAll right?\u201d Sirius came out and joined him.\n\n\n\u201cMmm.\u201d Remus nodded, smiling widely.\n\n\n\u201cPisshead.\u201d Sirius smirked.\n\n\n\u201cOi!\u201d Remus shot back, playfully, \u201cI can hold my drink, ffffank you very much. Unlike\n\n\nsome\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Sirius humoured him, leaning against the wall too. He took Remus\u2019s hand, and laced their fingers together.\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus nodded emphatically, \u201cRemember my fifteenth? You and Pete got so wankered, you threw up in the tunnel.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGodric, how could I forget,\u201d Sirius laughed. \u201cHorrific.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNahh,\u201d Remus sighed, happily, squeezing Sirius\u2019s fingers. \u201cIt was nice. You fell asleep on my shoulder and told me I was magic.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDid I?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou did.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat does sound nice. I must have been very drunk.\u201d He laughed, \u201cNot that I\n\n\ndon\u2019t\n\n\nthink you\u2019re magic, Moony.\u201d\n\n\nRemus\u2019s mind had drifted, though. His cigarette had gone out, and he dropped it.\n\n\n\u201cWish I could say stuff like that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Sirius frowned.\n\n\n\u201cNice stuff.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou say lots of nice stuff, Moony.\u201d\n\n\nRemus shook his head, frowning. It was no good.\n\n\n\u201cNeed another drink.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk, come on then\u2026\u201d\n\n\nInside, Peter was half asleep, propped up on his elbow, and Lily was sitting in James lap. She seemed to be trying to locate his tonsils with her tongue.\n\n\n\u201cBloody hell.\u201d Sirius groaned, \u201cGive it a rest, you two.\u201d\n\n\nRemus sniggered, finishing the last of his whisky. That was better.\n\n\n\u201cYou can talk!\u201d Lily poked her pink tongue out at him. \u201cMarlene told me she caught you two snogging in the corridor the other night!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo what if she did?\u201d Siris replied, primly, \u201cIt was private enough until she showed up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cChristopher was there,\u201d Remus put in. Lily laughed and pointed at Sirius,\n\n\n\u201cHa! Exhibitionist!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s right.\u201d Remus nodded, drunkenly, \u201cYou are. Remember I caught you with Mary all the time when I was a prefect.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh well, that was\n\n\nMary\n\n\n, you know what\n\n\nMary\u2019s\n\n\nlike\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Lily said, still giggling and quite pink in the face now, \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what Mary told me about you last year!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was before you came out, so you\u2019d think she\u2019d admit it was made up by now, but she told me and Marlene that you and she\u2026\n\n\nyou\n\n\nknow\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMade sweet heterosexual love?\u201d Sirius supplied, barely stifling his own laughter now.\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Remus said, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s true, actually.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Lily stared at him, her mouth open.\n\n\n\u201cAges ago\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLast year, actually.\u201d Sirius corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Lily, he only did it to make me jealous.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cArrogant prick.\u201d Remus snorted.\n\n\nPeter began to snore. James looked at him, then at his pocket watch,\n\n\n\u201cReckon we\u2019d better head back?\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nRemus insisted on finishing not only his drink, but everyone else\u2019s before they left. He wanted to be good and drunk, so that he would fall straight to sleep, without any of the intrusive thoughts that had been plaguing him since Marlene\u2019s return. Plus, though he wasn\u2019t going to tell Sirius, his hip didn\u2019t hurt as much with all that liquor in his blood.\n\n\nJames was true to his word, and gave Lily a piggyback all the way to Honeyduke\u2019s. Remus looked at Sirius with a quirked eyebrow. The other boy laughed,\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll levitate you, if you want, but I am\n\n\nnot\n\n\ncarrying you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho says romance is dead,\u201d Peter yawned, rubbing his eyes and trailing along beside them.\n\n\nBy the time they were descending the steps into the cellar of the sweet shop, Remus was feeling a lot less cheerful about the whole thing. Perhaps the last few whiskies had been a bad idea. His head was starting to throb painfully, and his vision was swimming. His limbs felt heavy, and as they sank into the darkness of the tunnel, he quite fancied just curling up to sleep right there.\n\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019ll miss us,\u201d he mumbled as Sirius gently pulled him along, \u201cS\u2019a weekend tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be happy waking up here, Moony,\u201d Sirius chided gently. \u201cTrust me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI trust you.\u201d Remus replied, his mouth thick with saliva.\n\n\nIt was all right for Peter. He\u2019d transformed into a rat and curled up to sleep in Lily\u2019s pocket.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so good at that,\u201d Sirius marvelled, \u201cI can\u2019t transform drunk.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can!\u201d James said, excitedly, and promptly did, much to Lily\u2019s fright.\n\n\n\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d she breathed, \u201cI\u2019m never going to get used to that.\u201d\n\n\nProngs bowed his antlered head, and lowered one knee, allowing Lily to climb onto his back. She gripped his neck, grinning, and whooped as James set off clattering down the tunnel at a gallop.\n\n\nRemus and Sirius stared after them as they vanished into the darkness.\n\n\n\u201cCharming.\u201d Sirius huffed.\n\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you a more useful animal?\u201d Remus grumbled, leaning heavily against him.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we got to\n\n\nchoose\u2026\n\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUrrgh.\u201d Remus groaned, \u201cI\u2019m going to be sick.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUgh, over there, then\u2026\u201d Sirius grabbed him by the shoulders and turned him around just in time.\n\n\nLuckily Remus hadn\u2019t eaten much that day, but it still felt horrible. His gut contracted painfully and he retched until his eyes bulged and he thought he\u2019d choke. His eyes were stinging with tears when he finally came up for hair. He rubbed them away quickly. Sirius handed him a goblet of cold water.\n\n\n\u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d Remus spluttered, wiping his mouth.\n\n\n\u201cKeep it on me for the full moons,\u201d Sirius shrugged, \u201cWeightlessness charm. Must have left it in my pocket. Oi, just sip it, or you\u2019ll chuck it all up again.\u201d\n\n\nRemus obeyed. He washed his mouth out and spat.\n\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d He said, weakly, \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCall it payback for your fifteenth.\u201d Sirius laughed, \u201cCome on, shall we keep going?\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded, a hand on Sirius\u2019s shoulder to keep himself steady.\n\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019a got so drunk.\u201d He mumbled.\n\n\n\u201cYou deserved it.\u201d Sirius replied, blas\u00e9. \u201cAfter the day you\u2019ve had. Or the week you\u2019ve had\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was a prick.\u201d Remus was getting melancholy now, feeling sorry for himself. Sirius wasn\u2019t having any of it.\n\n\n\u201cEnough of that now, we\u2019ve talked about it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\n\n\nam\n\n\na prick though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo. You\u2019re lovely.\u201d Sirius insisted.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any feelings.\u201d Remus moped.\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you on about, of course you\u2019ve got feelings. Look, we\u2019re nearly there, now. Ugh, those bastards have gone on without us. Hey, do you reckon Prongs figured out how to change back?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe told me she loves me.\u201d Remus said, his forehead on Sirius\u2019s shoulder, now.\n\n\n\u201cWhat? Who? ...oh\u2026 right\u2026\u201d Sirius stopped to check he was ok. He tried to be comforting, \u201cWell that\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it? Nice to hear that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say it back.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, Moony, that\u2019s to be expected. Doesn\u2019t mean you haven\u2019t got\n\n\nfeelings\n\n\n! I know you\u2019ve got your heart set on being a monster, but I\u2019m sorry to tell you that you are\n\n\nnot\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t say it.\u201d Remus insisted, his voice muffled. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can say it to anyone. Even if I want to.\u201d\n\n\nSirius went very quiet and very still for a while. They were at the entrance of the tunnel now, in a few moments they would be back inside the castle. Sirius gave Remus a quick hug, stroking his hair gently. He pulled away and held his hand tightly.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ok, Remus,\u201d he whispered, even though they were alone. \u201cThat\u2019s ok, because it\u2019s not something you say. It\u2019s something you do. Right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Remus nodded, tearful and drunk, but somewhat placated.\n\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d Sirius smiled again. \u201cNow, let\u2019s get you to bed, eh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d Remus agreed. Just as Sirius was pushing the statue of the humpbacked witch aside, Remus touched his arm, \u201cSirius?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re magic.\u201d"

            "content": "Saturday 25th February 1978\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t think he had ever hated fire whisky more. When he woke up the next morning his throat was raw, his limbs ached and his head was throbbing. He\u2019d take a full moon over a hangover any day. At least after a full moon everyone was sympathetic.\n\n\n\u201cUrrrgh.\u201d Someone else groaned from their bed. There were loud footsteps, as whoever it was ran to the bathroom, slammed the door, and began to throw up noisily.\n\n\n\u201cLovely.\u201d Sirius murmured from the pillow next to Remus.\n\n\n\u201cAll right in there, Pete?\u201d James shouted. He was met with an alarming gurgling sound from within the bathroom. \u201cBit of breakfast\u2019ll sort you out,\u201d James advised.\n\n\nRemus heard James\u2019s feet hit the floor. He began to whistle a jaunty tune. Bloody perfect Potter and his immunity to hangovers.\n\n\nRemus\u2019s stomach growled. Breakfast sounded good, despite the stabbing pain behind his eyeballs. Sirius raised his head at the noise and grinned,\n\n\n\u201cAll right, Moony?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d He nodded, weakly, \u201cThirsty. Hungry.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cS\u2019pose I\u2019m not getting my saturday lie in, then\u2026\u201d Sirius sighed over-dramatically. He whipped back the duvet, then the curtains to climb out.\n\n\nRemus sat up slowly.\n\n\n\u201cPyjamas?\u201d He grumbled, feeling around under his pillow.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, you put up a bit of a fight on that front,\u201d Sirius chuckled, stretching and yawning. \u201cSaid you were too hot. You threw them across the room and I gave up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDefeatist.\u201d Remus replied, clambering out of bed in his boxers to look for them. He\u2019d have to go and use the shared bathroom up the hall; it didn\u2019t sound like Peter would be coming out any time soon. His eyes stung in the bright morning sunlight, and he bent over, feeling about on the floor for his pyjama shirt and bottoms like a confused gibbon.\n\n\n\u201cMorning lads,\u201d Lily said, from the end of James\u2019s bed.\n\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d Remus jumped, surprised, and covered his crotch with the nearest quidditch magazine, then dived back behind his bed curtain, \u201cWhat the bloody hell are you doing here?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI slept here.\u201d Lily replied, a grin in her voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you two shared a bed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know\n\n\nyou\n\n\ntwo shared a bed.\u201d Sirius replied, indignantly. He threw Remus his pyjamas, \u201cThere you are, Moony, make yourself decent.\u201d\n\n\nRemus was going to kill James. What did he think he was playing at, inviting girls into their bedroom? Surely there was an unwritten rule on that?! Was nowhere sacred?! He pulled his pyjamas on as quick as he could over his underwear, then hurried out of the room.\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything!\u201d Lily called after him, giggling.\n\n\n\nChrist\n\n\n.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThank goodness it was saturday. They made slow progress to breakfast, but in the end even Peter made it down, though he was still very pale and quiet, and just sat sipping his tea.\n\n\nRemus, meanwhile loaded his plate up until he couldn\u2019t see the china pattern. Weekend breakfasts were the best; fried eggs, thick cumberland sausages, dark fried mushrooms, bacon, golden toast slathered in butter, baked beans, fried tomato, black pudding\u2026 he was seriously going to miss Hogwarts food.\n\n\n\u201cWhy is Remus eating a hangover breakfast?\u201d Mary asked, pouring herself some orange juice. \u201cAnd where were you all yesterday afternoon?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThink you\u2019ve answered your own question, MacDonald,\u201d Sirius winked.\n\n\n\u201cYou lot have all the fun.\u201d She grumbled.\n\n\n\u201cNot fun.\u201d Peter replied, his head in his hands, \u201cBad. Bad time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHave something to eat, Wormtail,\u201d Remus suggested, swallowing his own mouthful. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s frightened he\u2019ll lose an arm\u2026\u201d Sirius smirked, as Remus reached for another portion of bacon.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, that was the last slice of toast, Moony!\u201d James complained.\n\n\n\u201cOh for goodness sake, the plates refill, don\u2019t they.\u201d Remus rolled his eyes.\n\n\n\u201cAlways wondered how that happens,\u201d Mary mused, watching as the toast rack was magically replenished.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that complicated,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cBasic teleportation spell - the house elves have tables directly beneath us in the kitchens; they load that up, then transport the food to the corresponding plates above.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSort of like a magical dumbwaiter.\u201d Remus nodded, now constructing himself a very complex sandwich.\n\n\n\u201cSounds complicated to me.\u201d Mary said. \u201cI\u2019m useless at teleportation, though, I had to re-take my apparition test three times.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier with inanimate objects,\u201d Remus said, helping himself to ketchup, \u201cand they\u2019re only sending it directly up, so the destination part doesn\u2019t take as much effort.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI tried using it to clean my room once,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cI just transported all the messy stuff into the room above mine. Except I couldn\u2019t get it back again after; my mother had an impenetrable lock on the attic. And I accidentally transported my bed, so that caused a bit of a row\u2026\u201d\n\n\nJames and Remus sniggered. Peter raised his head.\n\n\n\u201cHm.\u201d He said.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Lily asked, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be sick again, are you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m just thinking\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMerlin!\u201d Sirius teased, \u201cBetter get him a painkilling draught\u2026\u201d\n\n\nPeter diligently ignored him, eyes focussed on the plates of food.\n\n\n\u201cCould we do it on a bigger scale?\u201d He asked, \u201cThe transportation thing?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou mean like getting food from the kitchens to our dorm?\u201d Remus asked, \u201cI don\u2019t think so, I think only the house elves can do it. Would be great, though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Peter frown, shaking his head, \u201cMore like what Sirius was saying - with beds, and trunks, and furniture\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, probably,\u201d Sirius shrugged, \u201cI\u2019m guessing that\u2019s how everything ends up on the train at the end of term. Powerful bit of magic, though - it took me half a day to do my bedroom. Mind you, I was fourteen\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of people, though,\u201d Peter said, now looking up at James, grinning. \u201cWe could do it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPeter,\u201d James was starting to smile now too. \u201cHave you just had your best bloody idea in seven years of pranking?\u201d\n\n\nPeter grinned back at him, looking happier than Remus had seen him in ages.\n\n\n\u201cEmergency co-operative meeting!\u201d James carried on, standing up, excitedly, \u201cSpread the word!\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThe problem with planning a prank between thirty people rather than four was pure logistics. Between quidditch practices, clubs, NEWT and OWL revision and room availability, calling an emergency meeting was nearly impossible. It ended up being pushed back to Sunday, then Monday - then, much to James\u2019s exasperation - their usual Wednesday slot.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still plenty of time,\u201d Lily soothed, \u201cAnd we can always start researching it now, so we have the right spells ready to show the group.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cS\u2019pose.\u201d James muttered, scuffing his feet on the flagstones as they walked back to the common room.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got some dungbombs lying about, if you fancy blowing off some steam today\u2026\u201d Sirius threw an arm around James.\n\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t hear this\u2026\u201d Lily covered her ears and ran ahead to catch up with Mary.\n\n\nOn the fat lady\u2019s corridor, Remus paused.\n\n\n\u201cYou lot go on, I\u2019ll just be a minute.\u201d He stopped outside Professor McGonagall\u2019s office door.\n\n\nSirius glanced back and gave him a nod of understanding, before carrying on with James and Peter, loudly arguing over the best place to plant the dungbombs.\n\n\nRemus knocked on the office door, timidly.\n\n\n\u201cEnter,\u201d came a voice from within.\n\n\nHe pushed the door open, and poked his head around nervously before going inside.\n\n\n\u201cHello, professor.\u201d He said, approaching her desk.\n\n\nMcGonagall was marking some essays, piled up neatly in front of her, a red quill flicking smoothly across the parchment as she read. She looked up and smiled at him pleasantly,\n\n\n\u201cLupin, lovely to see you. Please have a seat.\u201d\n\n\nHe sat carefully, strangely reminded of the very first time he\u2019d been in her office, and how \u00a0tall and frightening she had seemed. He\u2019d really thought he would hate her, she\u2019d seemed so much like matron. Now he was able to meet her eye, and smile back as though she were a real friend. \u201cHow can I help?\u201d She asked, as the red quill came to rest in the inkwell beside the papers.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I wanted to ask a favour,\u201d he said, carefully. He felt inside his pockets and pulled out the letter from his mother. He put it on the desk, and slid it across. \u201cOver Christmas the Potters helped me track down my mum. I wrote to her, and she wrote back. She\u2019s in a muggle hospital, in Wales. I\u2019d like to have permission to go and see her.\u201d\n\n\nMcGonagall only glanced down at the letter briefly, before looking at him again.\n\n\n\u201cOf course. We can make arrangements as soon as you\u2019d like.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally?!\u201d He was amazed it had been that easy.\n\n\n\u201cReally,\u201d she replied, \u201cMr Lupin, this is a school, not a prison. Students are permitted to visit family members.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh. Well, great. I thought maybe on the next Hogsmeade weekend?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d she opened a notebook and jotted something down, \u201cCome and see me on the morning of, and I\u2019ll write your permission slip.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWould you like somebody to go with you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 no. Thanks, but no.\u201d Now that he\u2019d done it once, he realised that it was something he needed to do alone. He wasn\u2019t looking forward to breaking that to Sirius, but there was no helping it.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very pleased for you, Remus,\u201d McGonagall said, smiling again. \u201cYou know that my door is always open, if you need somebody to talk to. Though I know you aren\u2019t short of friends.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he looked down, bashfully.\n\n\n\u201cHow is your revision going, Mr Lupin?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGood, thanks.\u201d Remus nodded, glad to be onto an easier subject.\n\n\n\u201cBetter than good, from what I\u2019ve heard,\u201d she continued, smiling, \u201cAll of your professors have given excellent reports on your achievements. In most classes you\u2019re performing well above your peers, and I hear you\u2019ve not only been working hard for yourself, but to help others, too?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe study groups are a collaborative thing\u2026\u201d Remus said, awkwardly.\n\n\n\u201cNevertheless,\u201d Professor McGonagall shook her head, \u201cI\u2019m proud to have you in my house, Mr Lupin.\u201d\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t know what to say to that, so he just looked at his hands. \u201cMr Lupin,\u201d his head of house continued, \u201cI have a favour to ask\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA favour?\u201d Remus looked up, surprised. What on earth?\n\n\n\u201cAhem, yes\u2026\u201d McGonagall looked a bit sheepish, and leaned in slightly, \u201cAs I\u2019m sure you know, the final quidditch match of the year will be taking place in April, just before exams,\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, James has the schedule posted up in our room with an enchanted countdown in seconds and everything.\u201d\n\n\nMcGonagall smiled fondly.\n\n\n\u201cJames has been an absolute asset to the team, he's led Gryffindor on a record winning streak during his time here. The team he has assembled is first rate, primed to win their sixth cup in as many years\u2026 which brings me to my problem.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 you want my help with a quidditch problem?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIndeed. Now, I cannot go into too much detail, but I am sorry to say that Alexander Gordon, our beater, will be returning home for the rest of the term. I shall be telling Potter on Monday, of course, a replacement must be found as soon as possible, which is why I wanted to speak with you first..\u201d\n\n\n\u201cProfessor, I\u2019m awful at quidditch!\u2019 Remus said, breaking out in a cold sweat.\n\n\nMcGonagall stared at him with a frown for a moment, before breaking into a (highly out of character) chuckle. She raised her hand to her mouth, apologetically,\n\n\n\u201cGoodness, Lupin! I didn't mean to suggest... \u00a0though I\u2019m sure you are quite capable on a broom, it wasn\u2019t you I had in mind.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Remus exhaled, his shoulders relaxing. \u201cOh, good. Er\u2026 then how can I help?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d McGonagall turned serious once more. \u201cWe do have rather a good beater already in Gryffindor. But as you are aware, he was struck off the team two years ago.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSirius.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNow, I don't wish to condone his behaviour, nor diminish the enormity of the incident which occurred in your fifth year\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Remus swallowed, finding his mouth quite dry. He didn\u2019t like to think about that, not ever. Like his hip, it was a pain which sometimes surfaced, but that he had to ignore in order to keep going.\n\n\n\u201cAnd I stand by the punishment he received,\u201d his teacher continued, \u201cBut\u2026 well he was only struck off the team, he wasn\u2019t placed under permanent ban.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Remus nodded, soberly. \u201cSo he can play again, if he wants to.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus, I\u2019m not going to allow it unless you agree.\u201d McGonagall said, placing a hand on the desk between them. \u201cIt was you that Sirius put in danger, and if you feel--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus said, \u201cI mean yes, I mean\u2026 let him back on the team.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d She peered over her spectacles at him, as if trying to read his expression.\n\n\n\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d Remus forced a smile. \u201cOf course. It was two years ago.\u201d\n\n\nMcGonagall watched him a bit longer, then smiled back, visibly relieved. He\u2019d done the right thing, then. The thing she\u2019d wanted.\n\n\n\u201cThank you, Mr Lupin,\u201d she nodded, leaning back again. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Potter first thing tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGreat.\u201d Remus nodded, getting up from his seat. \u201cThanks, professor, see you Monday.\u201d"

            "content": "He could have told James and Sirius straight away, if he\u2019d wanted to. Could have played the hero, enjoyed the spotlight and being the cause of their joy. But he didn\u2019t. He told himself it was to preserve Alexander Gordon\u2019s privacy, or to respect McGonagall\u2019s authority. But the truth was that he just didn\u2019t want anything to do with it at all.\nObviously he wanted Sirius to be happy. Obviously he didn\u2019t want to be an obstacle to Sirius\u2019s happiness. And\nobviously\nhe wanted Gryffindor to beat Slytherin in the final match; for James to have his moment of glory. He didn\u2019t want to see Sirius punished forever for a mistake he made at sixteen. He didn\u2019t want betrayal to hang over them like that, or to bring it all up again. And yet, there it was.\nRemus had forgiven Sirius, back in the Potters\u2019 bathroom two years ago; had absolved a truly repentant boy with blood on his hands and sorrowful eyes. It had been before they understood each other, before so many other\ngood\nmemories, of\ngood\nthings which had changed their friendship. But Remus hadn\u2019t forgotten how it had felt. Sirius could destroy him completely without even meaning to. If anything, Remus was even more vulnerable to that now than he had been at sixteen.\nNo, Remus told himself. There was a difference between atonement and revenge. Sirius had earned this.\nOn Monday morning, James received a note from McGonagall, asking to see him before quidditch practice. He hurried off without even finishing his breakfast - nothing was more important than the final match. Marlene and Yaz began speculating on what it could be, Peter and Sirius leaning across the table eagerly to join in. Remus just waited, feeling half pleased and half something else. As breakfast was finishing, James\u2019s muffled voice began emanating from the two-way mirror Sirius\u2019s robe pocket.\n\u201cPadfoot! Padfoot! Quidditch pitch! Now!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019dyou reckon he wants?\u201d Sirius scratched his head as they got up from the table.\n\u201cOh, I think you\u2019ll like it.\u201d Remus replied, cryptically. \u201cGo on, he sounds excited.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what it is, don\u2019t you?\u201d Sirius eyed him suspiciously.\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want me to walk you to Care of Magical Creatures?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll manage. Go! Hurry!\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t see James and Sirius again until lunch, and both of them were grinning from ear to ear. James had the quidditch schedule out and was marking out extra practice days so that Sirius could get back up to speed.\n\u201cYou were right,\u201d Sirius beamed, practically bouncing in his seat as Remus arrived, \u201cI did like it.\u201d\nRemus just smiled back. It was enough to see him happy; and if love\nwas\nsomething you did, then Remus hoped this was enough.\n\u201cWhat are you so happy about?\u201d Marlene asked, sitting down opposite ther boys.\n\u201cSay hello to your new beater,\u201d Sirius burst out.\nJames laughed, nodding.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Marlene smiled brightly, \u201cExcellent! Er\u2026 what happened to Gordon?\u201d\n\u201cGone home.\u201d James replied, \u201cNot supposed to ask.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Well, anyway,\u201d Marlene shook her head, \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic, I\u2019ve missed having you watching my back. So how come McGonagall let you? I thought you got kicked off for doing something unspeakable\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Mary added, stirring grated cheese into her leek and potato soup, \u201cI remember something like that too, what did you do?\u201d\nSirius visibly balked at this, his eyes widening.\nRemus frowned slightly. Was this the first time it had occurred to him? Had Remus been agonising over the implications of an event Sirius barely even remembered?! He decided to rescue him, nonetheless,\n\u201cHa, you can\u2019t expect Sirius to remember every stupid stunt he pulls that gets him into trouble.\u201d He said, cheerfully.\nThe girls accepted this, and lunch continued, but Remus could feel Sirius\u2019s eyes on him the whole time. Apparently he had caught up.\nWell\n, Remus thought,\nat least it only takes him a few hours now. This time last year it would have been months.\nThroughout the rest of the afternoon lessons, Remus\u2019s gut instinct was to be evasive; to make a quick get away after his final class and stay in the library as late as he could, then go straight to bed without speaking.\nBut really, he tried to reason with himself, wasn\u2019t that just another way to punish Sirius? It certainly didn\u2019t demonstrate forgiveness. He hadn\u2019t forgotten their recent fight, and how Sirius had called him \u2018bloody exhausting\u2019. It had actually hurt his feelings quite a lot, at the time, and he knew that this was because it was so painfully true.\nSo. He\u2019d try it Sirius\u2019s way.\n\u201cFancy a walk after dinner?\u201d He asked, casually, tapping the box of matches where he kept his cigarettes and - sometimes - something more recreational.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius smiled, surprised, \u201cSounds good.\u201d\nPudding appeared on the table in front of them. James was taking notes on the teleportation mechanism, and kept picking up plates as soon as they emptied, to see if they would refill in mid-air, or land on the table itself.\n\u201cPotter if you drop\neven one\ntreacle tart I\u2019ll have your guts for garters\u2026\u201d Lily threatened.\n* * *\nIt was easy enough for them to get away that evening, and they wandered towards to astronomy tower, because the evenings were nice now that winter was finally on it way out, and no one would have a go at them for smoking.\nThey interrupted a couple of fifth years clumsily groping on the parapets, and used their seventh year privilege to send them on their way.\n\u201cHonestly, when we were their age, we never\u2026\u201d Sirius tutted disapprovingly.\n\u201cSure you want to finish that?\u201d Remus raised a wry eyebrow.\nThey settled down. Remus rolled up his robes to use as a cushion, and they sat with their backs to the wall, companionably rolling spliffs. \u201cI\u2019m really happy for you.\u201d Remus started, after his first inhale. \u201cAbout the quidditch. You deserve it.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Sirius nodded, sounding relieved. \u201cI really\u2026 um. I asked James, and he said McGonagall asked you if it was ok first.\u201d\n\u201cShe did.\u201d Remus agreed, keeping his voice steady. \u201cObviously I said it was fine. Obviously.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m really grateful. You didn\u2019t have to, I would have understood.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Remus looked at him, finally.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Sirius said, earnestly, \u201cI deserved to be struck off; I deserved to be\nexpelled\nfor what I did. Locked up in Azkaban. I got off easy, and I know it.\u201d\n\u201cI never wanted you to suffer.\u201d Remus said. \u201cI hated you for it - I won\u2019t lie. But I forgave you then, and I can\u2019t keep holding a grudge. You\u2019ve made it up to me, like you said you would.\u201d\nHe felt a bit light-headed, saying all of this. It wasn\u2019t much, no, but he knew they both felt the weight of the words. Sirius had always tried to understand him harder than anyone.\n\u201cStill,\u201d Sirius replied, placing a hand over Remus\u2019s, \u201cIf you\u2019re still angry about it, that\u2019s ok. I still feel guilty about it. It\u2019s the worst thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk about it\u2026\u201d Remus shifted uncomfortably.\nHe\nreally didn\u2019t want to talk about it.\n\u201cI just wanted you to know that I\ndo\nstill feel responsible. I don\u2019t blame anyone but myself - not even Snivellus. Not even\u2026 not even her.\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d Remus frowned, lost.\nHe felt Sirius\u2019s leg stiffen beside him, saw his hand tremble just for a moment.\n\u201cMy mother.\u201d He said, quietly. His breathing was shallow, and he spoke so quietly Remus had to strain his ears to catch it all. \u201cDo you remember what happened that Christmas? It was when I got kicked out\u2026\u201d\nRemus nodded. How could he ever forget? It had been one of the worst nights of his life, and he had had more than his fair share.\nSirius continued, looking down at his knees, curling up smaller against the stone rampart.\n\u201cShe\u2019d done stuff before - I mean, you know about that, the cutting, and the silencing and that time she vanished my hair. But - and I know this sounds weird - I never thought she\u2019d do\u2026\nthat\n. She threatened to disown me all the time, threatened to do all sorts. But until they started getting in deep with Voldemort, I never really believed her.\u201d\nHe paused, apparently to take a few deep breaths, then pressed on bravely. \u201cIt was always the most important thing, when I was growing up; family. Family loyalty. I know they froze out Andromeda, but mother knew we were still in touch, she didn\u2019t try to stop it. So I thought - well, they must be planning to forgive her one day. Bring her back into the fold; because she was\nfamily\n. And it was arrogant of me, but I really never thought it would happen to\nme\n.\u201d\nHe looked at Remus, bashfully, as if he had said something idiotic, and expected to be teased. Remus said nothing, only gripped his hand. Sirius sighed.\n\u201cBut then it did happen - and they\u2019d punished me\nso many\ntimes before, I thought I knew what to expect. But not like that. I\u2019d never been so\u2026 so scared.\u201d His eyes were shimmering now, and he was staring angrily ahead, \u201cI hated it, feeling that way, and all I could think, lying in bed at the Potters, was how you or James would have done better. Been braver, or figured out away to fight back. I didn\u2019t fight back, because\u2026 because they were my family.\u201d\n\u201cSirius\u2026\u201d Remus tried to sound gentle, but Sirius shook his head, wiping his eyes quickly,\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s ok, I\u2019m not telling you so you feel sorry for me, I\u2019m not making excuses. There\u2019s no excuse. I\u2019m just\u2026 I dunno, trying to explain. Anyway; that happened at Christmas, and then I was living at the Potters after that, so it was all ok, for me, wasn\u2019t it? Like\u2026 I was safe, and I had nothing to be scared of. But I still felt like she could get me. I had these nightmares, remembering the curse. Sorry, I know it sounds stupid.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound stupid at all!\u201d\n\u201cStill. I felt like I had to do something, and maybe I didn\u2019t always have the best ideas. You know what I was like - all over the place, acting like a twat. Me and James, we both used to egg each other on, didn\u2019t we? And Snape was so easy to pick on, because he\u2019s so foul and nasty already. Godric,\nso\nnasty. He tried to attack Mary, and then him and Reg tried to hurt you too, remember? And he just kept going, no matter what we did. And I just\u2026 not like Snape is like my mother or anything - I think there are at least six degrees of evil between them - but he made me feel the way\nshe\nmade me feel. Like I couldn\u2019t control it. I just wanted to make him scared; make him feel it too, so that maybe he\u2019d stop. It's no excuse, and I\u2019m\nso sorry\n, Moony.\u201d\nRemus had not let go of Sirius\u2019s hand. Something strange was happening inside of him. Something which he had rarely felt outside of a full moon. A fierce and overwhelming desire to\nprotect\nthis boy sitting next to him. To make sure he was never frightened again. He pulled Sirius to him, taking his spliff and pressing their lips together.\n\u201cIt's forgiven.\u201d He said, \u201cI mean it.\u201d\nSirius didn\u2019t speak, just looked up at him, grateful and happy, and Remus thought if he could bottle that look then he\u2019d never struggle with a patronus again. \u201cAnd you can blame your mother for it if you like.\u201d Remus said, pulling away, \u201cShe sounds like a right cunt.\u201d\nSirius snorted with laughter and buried his face in Remus\u2019s shoulder,\n\u201cYou oik,\u201d he chuckled, gleefully. \u201cI really bloody l--\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s up here?!\u201d Mary came tiptoeing around the corner. \u201cOh.\u201d She sighed, upon seeing them. \u201cI was hoping you were Marlene and Yaz, been trying to catch them for ages, finally put an end to this sneaking around malarkey.\u201d\nSirius leaned back against the wall, wiping his eyes quickly.\n\u201cAll right, MacDonald,\u201d he grinned, squinting up at her.\n\u201cOhhh, is that what I think it is?\u201d Mary glimpsed the spliff in Remus\u2019s hand, \u201cSharesies!\u201d\n* * *\nFriday 10th March 1978 - Just before midnight.\n\u201cMoony! Where have you gone? They\u2019re going to do your cake before James really gets drunk\u2026\u201d Sirius called up the stairs.\nRemus smirked to himself, tipsily. James was too far gone already, if you asked him. He\u2019d been leaping all over the common room furniture to \u2018Jean Genie\u2019 for half an hour already.\n\u201cYeah I\u2019ll just be a sec!\u201d Remus called back.\nHe was looking for something to use as a vase, and finally settled on transfiguring an old Wellington boot which must have been one of Peter's from first year. \u201c\nAguamente,\u201d\nhe murmured, his wandwork a bit sloppy from the cider. He had thought cider would be a smarter choice than whisky, but if anything it seemed to have made him stupider than normal.\nHe dunked the bunch of tulips into the very rubbery looking vase, and grinned to himself.\n\u201cWhat are you doing up here?\u201d Sirius came in, now. He was drunk too; he had acquired a wide brimmed mauve hat from somewhere, and was wearing it at a jaunty angle. \u201cFlowers?\u201d He looked confused.\n\u201cEr yeah. From one of the Hufflepuffs in my study group,\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s giving you flowers?!\u201d\n\u201cMiranda O\u2019dell. Fourth year.\u201d\n\u201cBut\nwhy?!\u201d\n\u201cI asked her to,\u201d Remus smirked, enjoying the game.\nSirius threw his hands up,\n\u201cMoony! I am too drunk for your puzzles!\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re for Hope,\u201d Remus poked his tongue out. \u201cSeeing her tomorrow, remember?\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah!\u201d Sirius smiled again, eyes practically violet under the shade of his ridiculously flattering purple hat. \u201cLooking forward to it?\u201d\n\u201cD\u2019you know what, I sort of am? At least I don\u2019t want to throw up, like last time.\u201d\n\u201cProgress!\u201d Sirius flung his arms out. The volume of the music downstairs increased by a good few decibels, as that trilling guitar started all over again, and James\u2019s voice could be heard booming;\n\u201c\nA small Jean Genie snuck off to the city, strung out on lasers and slash-back blazers, ate all your razors while pulling the waiters\u2026\n\u201d\n\u201cJames really likes this song, eh?\u201d Remus grinned, hands in his pockets, enjoying being away from it all for a little bit.\n\u201cAfter years of trying, Bowie finally got through to him.\u201d Sirius returned, taking a few coy steps towards Remus, leaning against the bedpost in that devastatingly casual way. \u201cAre you enjoying your party?\u201d He tilted his head down as his asked, eyes big and flirtatious as a girl\u2019s.\n\u201cVery much,\u201d Remus bobbed his head, returning the smile.\n\u201cSomeone invited Lockhart, the prick.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, how come he\u2019s like that, anyway?!\u201d\nRemus just shrugged, eyes fixed on the way Sirius swung his hips unconsciously back and forth in time with the bass reverberating from the floorboards. When they left school, Remus would buy him a hundred pairs of black jeans, and that would be all he\u2019d allow him to wear.\n\u201cWant your present?\u201d Sirius asked, suddenly, catching Remus\u2019s eye.\n\u201cYou already got me a present!\u201d Remus protested. A full years supply of chocolate frogs - though Remus was pretty sure he could polish it off by the time exams were over.\n\u201cI\u2019m allowed to get you more than one thing.\u201d Sirius said, petulantly.\nHe stood away from the bed, legs apart, and waved his hands flamboyantly through the air like a muggle magician. Then, with a dramatic bow, he swept the hat from his head in one fluid motion, delved his hand inside and withdrew a small metal thing.\nHe handed it to Remus, who could smell that it was solid gold. It was a rectangular case, just bigger than his palm. It had the same leafy vine like design as his gold pocket watch, and felt good and weighty in his hand. He snapped it open to find a row of eighteen neatly rolled cigarettes nestled inside. The inside lid also had a design on it, delicately etched so that the finely hewn lines gleamed when they caught the light. It was a glimmering night sky, with a large, celestial moon in one corner, and Canis Major picked out in mother of pearl inlay.\n\u201cSirius.\u201d Remus said quietly, staring at it.\n\u201cSo you can get rid of that manky old matchbox.\u201d\n\u201cThank you\u2026 it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cOi you two, hurry up or Wormtail\u2019s going to start on the cake!\u201d James screamed up the stairs, ignoring Lily\u2019s attempts to shush him.\nRemus and Sirius grinned at each other, and headed down, holding hands right until the bottom step.\nThe common room was in an incredible state; barely recognisable. Multi coloured fairy lights hung from every rafter, balloons drifted up and down like weird bloated jellyfish, the suits of armour occasionally belched flame-free fireworks, and there were people on every stretch of carpet and bottles on every surface.\n\u201c\nJean Genie! Lives on his back! Jean Genie! Loves chimney stacks! He\u2019s outrageous, he screams and he bawls\u2026\n\u201d\nMost of the revellers were now leaping around the room with all the grace and dignity of kids on pogo sticks, led by James, Peter, Lily and Mary, who were jumping the most vigorously. James stopped when he saw Remus, and raised his arms cheering,\n\u201cMoonyyyyy!\u201d\n\u201cCake!\u201d Peter began to chant, \u201cCake, cake cake!\u201d\nEverybody joined in, and the crowd parted for Christopher and Marlene, who carried between them an enormous rectangular cake, the size of an overstuffed pillowcase. As they brought it to Remus, he saw with a flush of delight that it was decorated with chocolate buttercream icing to look like a gigantic leatherbound book.\n\u201cMy two favourite things,\u201d he laughed, ignoring the elbow in the ribs from Sirius.\nHe blew out the candles, and cut the cake, making the same wish both times. After that, James started leading everyone in a series of toasts; each more convoluted and elaborate than the last, encouraged by Sirius and Peter. That meant at least two more pints of cider, and some of Mary\u2019s witches brew when he ran out.\nRemus\u2019s last memory of his eighteenth birthday party was some lunatic deciding to put on\nGoats Head Soup\n- which had to be his least favourite Rolling Stones album, but he was pissed and he didn\u2019t care. The jumping and flailing continued, and the room was hot and loud and sweaty, and everyone was red faced and grinning - and Remus didn\u2019t even care when Lily and James pointed and laughed at him as the final track began to play and everyone belted out at the top of their lungs;\n\u201c\nIf I ever get back to New York, girl\n\nGonna make you scream all night\n\n\nYeah! You're a star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star!\n\n\nYeah, a star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star!\n\n\nA star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star fucker star!\u201d"

            "content": "She loved tulips. She loved daisies. She loved forget-me-nots, and gerberas and roses and daffodils - she loved every flower he brought her. He always tried to bring something. Flowers were free, as long as he kept Madam Sprout on side, and Hope hadn\u2019t much appetite, so chocolate was no good.\n\n\nThey had five more meetings over the spring of 1978, and Remus would forever mark each of them by the flowers he\u2019d brought to her. The conversations they had too, of course - but the flowers seemed to bookend everything; colouring each session with its own personality.\n\n\nTulips had presided over their second meeting. They were orange, pink and yellow, with sturdy dusky green stems and sumptuous velvet petals. A very generous flower, Remus thought.\n\n\nShe was ready for him, this time; she\u2019d had her hair washed and combed, and it gleamed sunny platinum blonde against the pink hospital blankets. She\u2019d put a spot of makeup on, too, though Remus felt bad for noticing that, because he felt he ought not to care how she looked.\n\n\n\u201cI got my sister to dig out some pictures,\u201d Hope said eagerly, tapping a brown paper envelope on her bedside, as Remus set down the weird vase he\u2019d drunkenly transfigured.\n\n\n\u201cWhat are they pictures of?\u201d He asked, cautiously, pulling up a seat beside her. He didn\u2019t want to be caught unawares by anything too painful.\n\n\n\u201cSome of you, as a baby,\u201d she smiled with shiny coral lips, \u201cSome of me and your father.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLyall.\u201d Remus said, quickly.\n\n\n\u201cMe and Lyall,\u201d she corrected herself, out of politeness.\n\n\nHope would bend over backwards to save Remus even the smallest upset; that much was clear from the beginning. He found it unsettling; very few people had ever cared about his feelings so intensely before.\n\n\nHe picked up the envelope, and held it for a moment.\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to look. We can do it another time.\u201d Hope said, a tremor of fear in her voice. He didn\u2019t want to frighten her. He wanted to tell her not to worry; that he wasn\u2019t going to run away, or disappear forever; that he wanted to be there, and get to know her. But that was all too much, so he just opened the package and smiled,\n\n\n\u201cNo, I want to see.\u201d\n\n\nFortunately there weren\u2019t very many - but he was surprised to find that more than half of the photographs were magical, and the images moved in his hands like film reels.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to keep them hidden,\u201d Hope confided, \u201cLyall never liked the usual sort of photography; he said they were too flat.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow old is he, in this one?\u201d Remus held up a photograph of both of his parents, standing in someone\u2019s back garden. Lyall was wearing a muggle suit, and they were both squinting against the sunshine, but smiling. He had his arm around Hope\u2019s waist.\n\n\n\u201cOh, I think we\u2019d only met a few weeks before that was taken,\u201d Hope said, taking it from him to look closer, \u201cHe\u2019d have been\u2026 thirty, I think?\u201d\n\n\nRemus looked at it again. He knew he looked like Lyall, he\u2019d been told so a few times, and to some extent he agreed. They were both gangly; tall and skinny with bad posture. But Lyall looked more at ease than Remus had ever felt in his over-long body; his movements in the photograph were confident and self-assured.\n\n\nShe let him take the pictures back to school, and he tentatively showed his friends. Over his seven years at Hogwarts, he had been shown a lot of family photos. Peter and James kept pictures in frames on their bedside, or else tacked up on the walls over their dressers. Lily had an album that she flipped through when she was homesick, and Mary had a shoebox full of holiday snaps, Christmases, postcards and pictures of her cousins in Jamaica. So it was a surprisingly nice experience, Remus thought, being able to share his own modest collection.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s them,\u201d he said, shyly, as they sat around the fireplace, \u201cThey\u2019re my parents.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus you look just like your dad!\u201d Lily said, meaning to be kind.\n\n\n\u201cWow, look at your mum\u2019s hair!\u201d Mary grinned, \u201cWhat a glamour puss!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAhhh!\u201d James snatched another picture, waving it at everyone, \u201cLook at little baby Moony!\u201d\n\n\nIt was silly, Remua knew, but he even felt the beginnings of pride, sharing his family like that. Proof that he\u2019d been normal, once; just like his friends.\n\n\nThis is who I am. This is who I came from.\n\n\n\nOne afternoon he even returned to the Ravenclaw corridor to see the duelling trophy with Lyall\u2019s name on it. It was the same as ever, but no longer gave him that mysterious ache of longing as it had in second year.\n\n\nChristopher and Marlene walked past, while he was looking at it.\n\n\n\u201cOh, \u2018Lupin\u2019!\u201d Christopher said, surprised, peering into the case to read the trophy, \u201cIs that your dad? Cool!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Remus put his hands in his pockets, suddenly bashful. Marlene touched his shoulder in a friendly, comforting way. He smiled at her, gratefully. \u201cI met my mum recently,\u201d Remus explained to Christopher, \u201cAnd it just had me thinking.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou met your mum? I thought your parents were dead.\u201d Christopher scratched his head. Honestly, if it wasn\u2019t written down in a book then he could be incredibly dense about some things.\n\n\n\u201cJust Lyall.\u201d Remus said, calmly, nodding at the trophy.\n\n\n\u201cSo if you mum\u2019s ok, why did you live in a home?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up, Chris.\u201d Marlene said, tutting. She slipped her arm through Remus\u2019s, linking them together, \u201cCome on, love, it\u2019s dinner soon.\u201d She began to lead him away.\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be rude!\u201d Christopher said, hurrying along behind them.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d Remus reassured him, doing some quick thinking. \u201cMy mum\u2019s in the hospital; she\u2019s not been well enough to look after me.\u201d It was only half a lie.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\u201cWhat was he like?\u201d Remus asked Hope, next time he saw her. A pot of geraniums, this time, bright red and gaudy, with lovely wide leaves like chinese fans.\n\n\n\u201cLyall?\u201d She asked.\n\n\nHe nodded, braced for impact.\n\n\n\u201cHe was the cleverest man I ever met.\u201d Hope said, decisively. \u201cI never understood half the things he said, but I loved to listen - and he loved to talk.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSounds a bit\u2026 arrogant?\u201d Remus said, uncomfortably. Hope laughed,\n\n\n\u201cOh, he was arrogant, all right! He knew it, too. Always had to be right, had to have the last word. We fought like cat and dog over it, sometimes.\u201d She saw Remus\u2019s look of dismay, and hurried to clarify, \u201cI loved him for it, though. I loved how sure he was; how reliable. He never let me down.\u201d\n\n\n\nYes he did.\n\n\nRemus thought, bitterly. She was forgetful about things like that - perhaps it was her illness, or just a side effect of a shortened life. She was relentlessly optimistic, unable to find fault in the people she loved.\n\n\nShe told him how they\u2019d met, like it was a fairytale.\n\n\n\u201cI was walking home from work one afternoon - I was an operator at the telephone exchange, back then. I took a shortcut - same one I always did, from the main bus stop in town - through a little bit of woodland. Then, from out of nowhere, this man came and attacked me - a vagrant, I thought, or an escaped prisoner. I screamed, and it was Lyall who saved me. Well, I loved him the moment he held me in his arms; he was a hero. Of course, he told me later it had only been a boggart, but it was still very brave, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded absently.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met some people who knew him,\u201d He said, \u201cThey\u2019ve told me he had a bad temper.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat? No.\u201d She frowned, \u201cHe got het up sometimes - don\u2019t we all? But he was always kind, and always gentle with us. He hated violence.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Remus nodded. He never knew what to think about Lyall. Nothing about him ever felt real, because nothing Remus ever learnt could wipe away what he\u2019d done.\n\n\nConversations with Hope weren\u2019t always difficult. Often they were very pleasant; they talked about small, inconsequential things; likes and dislikes, favourite foods, favourite films or songs.\n\n\nShe loved The Beatles, and Fairport Convention - and most of all she liked Simon and Garfunkel. She like sad songs. She hummed along to \u2018The Only Living Boy in New York\u2019, when it came on the record player, but \u2018America\u2019 was her favourite, because it made her cry.\n\n\nI\u2019m empty and aching and I don\u2019t know why.\n\n\n\nSometimes she was very unwell, and she dozed, wavering in and out of consciousness. He just sat by and read his book until it was time to go. She even asked him to read to her, once or twice,\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what it\u2019s about, I just like your voice,\u201d she would smile under heavy eyelids. He liked those times; he really felt like they belonged to each other, then.\n\n\n\u201cHave you asked her why, yet?\u201d Sirius asked him one evening, when he\u2019d returned from a day at the hospital.\n\n\n\u201cAsked her why what?\u201d Remus yawned, stretching out and placing his feet in \u00a0Sirius\u2019s lap. He thought they could get away with that - it wasn\u2019t\n\n\ntoo\n\n\nintimate, and the common room was relatively quiet.\n\n\n\u201cYou know. Why she never got in touch.\u201d\n\n\nRemus frowned. He leaned his head back on the arm of the settee and stared up at the ceiling.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t see the point asking.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d want to know.\u201d Sirius replied, fiddling with Remus\u2019s bootlaces.\n\n\n\u201cWell.\u201d Remus replied, coldly, \u201cThat\u2019s you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk,\u201d Sirius replied, \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\n\nRemus felt a twinge of guilt. Sirius had been extremely sensitive about bringing up Hope, letting Remus take the lead when it came to discussing it, so it wasn\u2019t fair to snap.\n\n\nIn truth, he was terrified. \u00a0He wanted very much to know exactly what Hope had been doing with herself for thirteen years, but he knew that there was no answer that would satisfy him. The other children that had been mentioned by the nurse on his first visit were never brought up, and she didn\u2019t wear a wedding ring. There were no other photographs around her hospital bed, and no sign that anyone else was visiting.\n\n\nAnd Remus was selfish. He liked having Hope all to himself; pretending there was no one else in the world. It was the only way they could communicate for now, he decided; to shut out all the noise of other people, and just be themselves together.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big book,\u201d she smiled, waking up halfway through another visit. Daisies, that time; big, cheerful, friendly flowers. \u201cWhat\u2019s it about?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHistory revision.\u201d He explained, closing it carefully, now she was awake. \u201cI\u2019ve got my final exams coming up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cClever boy,\u201d she murmured, her eyelids fluttering. \u201cWhat\u2019s your best subject?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUm\u2026 History, I s\u2019pose.\u201d He replied, \u201cBut I\u2019m good at Charms, and I like Care of Magical Creatures a lot.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust like your dad,\u201d she smiled, eyes closing. Her face was very pale, that day, and he didn\u2019t try to correct her, she was obviously exhausted. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll save a pretty girl from a boggart, one day.\u201d She chuckled quietly.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d He replied. Then, because he felt bad about lying, \u201cI like Transfiguration, too, but my friend Sirius is the best in the class - he can turn himself into a dog and everything.\u201d\n\n\nShe smiled,\n\n\n\u201cSirius is a nice name.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah. Sirius Black.\u201d Remus said. He was glad her eyes were closed, it made things easier. \u201cHe\u2019s my best friend. ...I mean, I have a lot of friends, but he\u2019s the most\u2026 we\u2019re probably going to live together, after school finishes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be nice\u2026\u201d she fell asleep again. Remus fidgeted for a bit, feeling anxious, then returned to his revision. He woke her up just before he had to leave, though.\n\n\n\u201cSee you next week?\u201d She clasped his hand with surprising strength.\n\n\n\u201cNo, sorry,\u201d he shook his head, \u201cI\u2026 next Friday is a full moon, so I won\u2019t be able to travel on Saturday.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFull moon\u2026\u201d she murmured, taking a few seconds to understand. When the fog cleared she had a sharp look of panic which Remus couldn\u2019t bear,\n\n\n\u201cMaybe I can come on Sunday, though. I\u2019ll see.\u201d He bent down and kissed her cheek, very lightly. She began to cry, and he had to go. He was halfway across the ward when he heard her mutter, very quietly,\n\n\n\u201cDamn you, Lyall Lupin, you bastard.\u201d"

He couldn\u2019t sleep; he was too hot with the duvet on; too cold if he pushed it off. His legs kept getting all tangled up in the bedsheets, his pillow had lumps in it, and somewhere in Gryffindor tower a tap was dripping, which was driving him insane. On top of this, he just didn\u2019t\n\n\nfeel\n\n\ntired.\n\n\nHe sighed heavily and rolled over again. Beside him, Sirius groaned.\n\n\n\u201cMoony, you are my best friend, and I would probably dive in front of a curse for you, but if you wake me up one more time then I cannot be held responsible for my actions.\u201d He said this all without opening his eyes.\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Remus whispered, \u201cI think it\u2019s the moon, I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMmmrgh.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\n\nHe got out of bed. It was no use keeping both of them up.\n\n\nOutside of the bed curtains, in the early morning gloom of their bedroom, Remus stood at the window for a while. It was a clear night, and the moon was almost full. Just one slither missing; he wondered if he had ever seen a full moon with his own human eyes. Perhaps he\u2019d been too young to remember.\n\n\nThe forest beneath the moon was black with shadow, and it seemed unbelievable to Remus that in only a few hours he and his friends would be running through those dark mysterious trees as if it was their own personal playground. Just now, it looked terrifying; a great black pit that could swallow you whole.\n\n\nOnly four more moons at Hogwarts. And then what?\n\n\nHe put that thought away for another time.\n\n\nRemus looked at his own empty bed, unenthusiastically. The curtains hadn\u2019t been drawn over for weeks, because he never slept there; only used it for homework. As a consequence it was covered with books, broken quills, chocolate wrappers, scrunched up balls of paper. Even if it had been tidy, the sheets looked somehow cold and uninviting in the moonlight. He\u2019d have sighed again, but he didn\u2019t want to make any more noise.\n\n\nThere were some biscuits in the common room. A tin of garibaldi\u2019s from Mrs Potter. If he took his book and his fags, he could have quite a pleasant few hours before he finally fell asleep or it was time for breakfast. His stomach growled, and that was the decision made. He pulled on a pair of thick socks (they were Peter\u2019s, actually, but he never minded lending stuff like that too much), picked up his wand and his book, and crept down to the common room, careful to step over the squeaky stair as he did.\n\n\nAs Remus pushed open the door to the common room, he realised too late that he was not alone. The fireplace was roaring, and the lamps around the couches glowing warmly. A figure was curled up on the largest red velvet settee, wrapped in a thick maroon blanket, with just a long black plait poking out of the top. In the armchair, clutching a mug of warm ovaltine, staring fixedly a the fire, was Marlene. She looked up as he entered, and Remus had no choice but to smile affably and approach her.\n\n\nAs he neared, he could see that her eyes were dark and heavy, her cheeks red and tearstained.\n\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d he said, low, so as not to wake Yaz.\n\n\nShe gave a small, faraway smile, unfurling slightly, wiping her cheeks.\n\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou ok?\u201d He stood just close enough. He didn\u2019t want to know the answer. He regretted everything, and wished with every fibre of his being that he was back in bed with Sirius, getting kicked in the shin every time he rolled over.\n\n\nMarlene shook her head mournfully, staring at the fire, her eyes filling up with tears. It was a familiar sight, these days, and not just Marlene. Bad news was so common. Family members in hospital, or dead, or - worse than either - missing.\n\n\n\u201cI said he could get in touch through the fireplace, if he wanted to talk tonight.\u201d She whispered, her voice hoarse as an old woman's. \u201cDanny. It's the full moon tomorrow. Well, tonight, I suppose.\u201d She glanced at the grandfather clock.\n\n\n\u201cOh, is it?\u201d Remus assumed as casual an air as possible.\n\n\nMarlene nodded, still looking at the fire.\n\n\n\u201cIt has to be tonight, you see; he\u2019s going to the ministry tomorrow and they\u2019ll lock him up in the cells there. I wanted to go home for it, but he says there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI suppose there isn\u2019t.\u201d Remus\u2019s stomach was clenching so hard he wanted to double over, he was so nervous and jittery already. \u201cHe\u2019ll be ok\u2026\u201d he tried, hoping he sounded kind.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll survive it.\u201d She said, bitterly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be ok. It takes a bit of you away, every time. I\u2019ve seen them, at St Mungo\u2019s. And\u2026 he told me. How it feels.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI asked.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cMadam Pomfrey says I have a curious mind, that's why I\u2019ll be a good healer. I wanted to know, so I could help. But he was so down after last month, so weak.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure just being there for him helps.\u201d Remus tried.\n\n\nMarlene wiped her eyes again with her sleeves.\n\n\n\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem like enough.\u201d She sighed heavily, and her focus seemed to return a bit. She looked at him properly, for the first one, \u201cSorry love, is everything ok with you? What are you doing up?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, just couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d He raised his book to demonstrate.\n\n\n\u201cMe neither. I knew Danny probably wouldn\u2019t try to get through, but I couldn\u2019t go to bed, just in case. Poor Yaz tried her best,\u201d she gave the girl sleeping on the couch an affectionate look. \u201cShe\u2019s too good for me by half.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPersonally I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s good\n\n\nenough\n\n\nfor you.\u201d Remus said - though it wasn\u2019t him speaking, not really - they were Sirius\u2019s words. He\u2019d noticed himself sounding more and more like Sirius, and found he didn't mind it. Anyway, it made Marlene smile again.\n\n\n\u201cLovely boy.\u201d She said, softly. \u201cSit down, eh? You\u2019re making me nervous hovering like that.\u201d\n\n\nHe sat awkwardly on the the sofa opposite Yaz. Marlene sat up, stretching, as though her back hurt. As she unfolded her legs from underneath her a quill fell onto the floor.\n\n\n\u201cOops,\u201d she leaned over to pick it up, \u201cI was going to try and write him a letter. But I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d She pulled the blank parchment out from the side of the armchair cushion.\n\n\nRemus sat stiffly with his book on his lap.\n\n\n\u201cIs it really a cell they put him in? At the ministry?\u201d He asked, unable to contain his grim curiosity. She stood up to stretch more, and nodded,\n\n\n\u201cYeah. Mum said. He wouldn\u2019t tell me about it - which means it must be bad. Mum said it\u2019s better I don\u2019t know too much\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMmm.\u201d Remus kept with mouth shut, not trusting himself. Marlene tilted her head sympathetically,\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Remus, I didn\u2019t even think. I feel awful whinging to you about this, given your situation.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d He stared up at her, his heart skipping a beat.\n\n\n\u201cWith your mum being in the hospital,\u201d Marlene replied, yawning, setting down the quill and parchment on the coffee table between them. \u201cNo wonder you can\u2019t sleep, either.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, yeah\u2026\u201d He willed himself to calm down. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s ok, though, I understand.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan I sit with you for a bit? You can read your book, I won\u2019t bother you.\u201d She asked, biting her lip. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to be the only one awake.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d\n\n\nTo his surprise, she didn\u2019t sit back down, but came over to join him on the couch. She settled in, making herself comfortable, pulling a blanket up to her chin. He pretended to do the same, opening his book and leaning casually against the arm of the chair.\n\n\n\u201cRevision?\u201d She asked, resting her cheek on his shoulder.\n\n\n\u201cWhat else,\u201d he replied. \u201cAdvanced Arithmancy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh Remus,\u201d she yawned again, her voice thick, \u201cHow\n\n\nfascinating\n\n\n.\u201d She relaxed a bit, and rested a hand on his knee. He gave it a quick squeeze for comfort.\n\n\n\u201cYou know me,\u201d he said softly, joining in her sarcasm, \u201cI live dangerously.\u201d\n\n\nShe gave a quiet chuckle, her eyes closing. He read, and felt her heartbeat steady, her breathing even out, and in only a few minutes she was fast asleep, a dead weight curled up against him. He didn\u2019t mind; it was quite nice.\n\n\nRemus stopped reading after Marlene had fallen asleep. He gently closed his book and just sat pondering for a while. He could smell the salt of her tears drying on her skin, and the anxiety in her blood. And he couldn\u2019t get Danny out of his mind, in an imagined Ministry of Magic cell - probably underground, probably bare and dark and cold\u2026\n\n\nThe pain would be a real shock, if you\u2019d never experienced it before, Remus thought. He could well imagine that the second full moon would feel even worse; because you\u2019d know what was coming. No wonder Danny didn\u2019t want to talk about it.\n\n\nIf what Marlene said was true, then her brother had no one else to ask about it. No one to tell him that if you tried to fight the transformation; if you tried to brace yourself against it, then it only hurt more. That murtlap essence was best for the initial cuts, but if you used muggle disinfectant too then the skin knit back together neater. Then there were the things that Remus wasn\u2019t sure if\n\n\nanyone\n\n\nknew - about the scent of magic, or how you could draw from it. How it made you stronger, as long as you could channel it right. How being a werewolf meant lots of things, and not all of them were awful.\n\n\nNo closer to sleep, Remus reached for the blank bit of parchment and began to write.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nI feel my brain like porridge coming outta my ears\n\n\n\n\nAnd I was anticipating reverie\n\n\n\n\nTaken leave of my senses and I'm in arrears\n\n\n\n\nMy legs buckle over, I'm living on my knees\n\n\n\n\nI gotta breakdown, yeah\n\n\n\n\nYou gimme breakdown, yeah\n\n\n\n\nI'm gonna breakdown, yeah, uh-huh\n\n\n\n\nFriday 24th March 1978\n\n\n5:30 pm\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to walk me,\u201d Remus snapped, irritably, \u201cI know where the hospital wing is.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sirius replied, cheerfully, getting up anyway.\n\n\nJames, Peter and Lily all looked down at their food\n\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t finished your dinner.\u201d Remus frowned.\n\n\n\u201cNor have you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to puke all over myself when the crippling agony hits.\u201d Remus muttered, darkly.\n\n\nSirius glanced down at their friends, staring stalwartly at their empty plates.\n\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Moony, let's go\u2026\u201d he said, a bit more gently.\n\n\nRemus shoved his hands deep in his robe pockets and strode quickly out of the Great Hall, forcing Sirius to jog slightly to keep up. \u201cHey!\u201d The dark haired boy hurried after him.\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t slow down until they were halfway to the hospital wing.\n\n\n\u201cOk, I get it, you\u2019re in one of your dark moods,\u201d Sirius puffed.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always in a dark mood.\u201d Remus tutted. \u201cYou ought to stop smoking, how are we going to beat Slytherin if you\u2019re so out of breath you can\u2019t keep up with\n\n\nme\n\n\n?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou can talk,\u201d Sirius straightened up. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen you without a fag in your mouth for weeks. Anyway. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally? You have to ask.\u201d Remus sped up again.\n\n\n\u201cOk, ok,\u201d Sirius grabbed his arm to slow him down, \u201cYou\u2019re not sleeping and you couldn\u2019t have dinner even though pudding was millionaire shortbread, which is your favourite\u2026 Fair enough, I\u2019d be grumpy too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not \u2018grumpy\u2019.\u201d Remus objected.\n\n\n\u201cTouchy, then.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFuck\n\n\noff\n\n\n.\u201d Remus practically growled. \u201cLeave me alone if you\u2019re going to be an arse.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to keep things in perspective!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMake me understand!\u201d\n\n\nThey were near-ish the hospital wing now, and everyone was at dinner, so the corridor was empty - which was lucky, because Remus didn\u2019t check before he completely lost his rag.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nMake\n\n\nyou understand?!\u201d He raved, \u201cFucking hell, ok, go on then. Understand that I\u2019m climbing the bloody walls with worrying and stressing and\u2026 it\u2019s NEWTs and the bloody moon and my fucking mother crying because I can\u2019t see her tomorrow because my fucking dad couldn\u2019t control his fucking temper and now I\u2019m\u2026 and\n\n\nMarlene\n\n\ncrying over her brother, which wasn\u2019t even my fucking fault, but it bloody well feels like it, and school\u2019s nearly finished, and there\u2019s a war on, and a quidditch match and this big prank, and my hip hurts, and I\u2019m just\n\n\ntired\n\n\n, and I really, really wanted pudding!\u201d\n\n\nHe felt foolish, once it was over, but a bit better too. Like there had been a balloon inflating in his chest all this time, and it had finally popped, giving him space to breathe again. He stood there, glaring at Sirius, waiting for a reaction.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nMy goodness\n\n\n.\u201d The portrait across from them said. She was a very stern looking witch, seated in a high backed wooden chair. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard such disgusting language.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh piss off you daft old trollop.\u201d Sirius shot at her, in a very good imitation of Remus. He looked at Remus again, and his face cracked into a smile, \u201cYou want to sit down for a bit? I think that\u2019s the most you\u2019ve ever said in one go.\u201d\n\n\nRemus exhaled, and smiled weakly back.\n\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFor what? Come on, Madam Pomfrey\u2019ll be having kittens\u2026\u201d They carried on their way, and the air was cleared, and nothing seemed quite so grim. Still, Remus hated Sirius having to go; knowing that the next time they\u2019d see each other neither of them would be quite themselves.\n\n\n\u201cSo the way I see it,\u201d Sirius said, still cheerful, after all that, \u201cIf I run back to the hall as fast as I can, I can get the last of the millionaire shortbread and wrap it up for you to have for breakfast. Anything else I can do to help?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a wanker sometimes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cActually, there is something\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 could you post this, for me?\u201d Remus handed him a sealed envelope. \u00a0Sirius took it, looking down with a frown.\n\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo. But it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk. I\u2019ll do it right now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnything for our Moon---\u201d\n\n\nRemus shut him up with a kiss.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nWhatever makes me tick\n\n\n\n\nIt takes away my concentration\n\n\n\n\nSets my hands trembling, gives me frustration\n\n\n\n\nBreakdown, yeah. I\u2019m gonna breakdown yeah.\n\n\n\n\nI hear that two is company,\n\n\n\n\nFor me it's plenty trouble\n\n\n\n\nThough my double thoughts are clearer\n\n\n\n\nNow that I am seeing double\n\n\n\n\nBreakdown, yeah\n\n\n\nSaturday 25th March 1978\n\n\nThe transformation hadn\u2019t been as bad as he\u2019d expected - maybe because nothing can ever be that bad, when you truly expect the worst. And the night itself was wonderful; he had run and run and run, until Prongs and Wormtail were lost, miles behind them, and it was just the wolf and the dog, snapping at each other playfully, goading each other on.\n\n\nIn the morning, once Remus had writhed and twisted back into his human body, he felt as though his bones were made of cooked spaghetti, he was so exhausted. He stumbled back to the hospital wing with Madam Pomfrey, half asleep, and was grateful to collapse into his favourite bed by the far window and sleep the whole morning away. It was blissful, to not be worrying; not fidgeting or clenching his jaw or looking for a distraction.\n\n\nIt was late afternoon, before Marlene finally heard about the letter.\n\n\nThe noise of her arguing with Madam Pomfrey woke Remus. He jolted awake, heart beating faster at the sound of raised voices. The first thing he saw was Sirius, fast asleep in the chair next to him, arms folded across his chest, head lolling, feet propped up on the edge of the hospital bedframe. There was a plate of at least twenty millionaire shortcakes on the bedside table.\n\n\nSirius\u2019s eyes snapped open a few seconds after Remus, and he blinked, surprised, and frowned.\n\n\n\u201cIs that McKinnon?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLET ME SEE HIM POPPY!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMISS MCKINNON, I ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT HAVE THIS--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI KNOW HE\u2019S HERE!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI SHALL CALL PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cREMUS?! REMUS LUPIN!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here, Marlene,\u201d Remus began to get out of bed, ready to face the music. If it was all over, he\u2019d still made it seven years. He was still legally allowed to perform magic, even if he did get exposed. \u201cIt\u2019s ok, Madam Pomfrey,\u201d he called, as Marlene came clattering across the ward, yanking back the screen which hid him.\n\n\n\u201cIs it true?!\u201d Her hair flew about her face as she stormed in, her eyes wide and wild.\n\n\nShe stared at him, and Remus knew she was really seeing him, for the first time; analysing. A natural Healer, Marlene looked at the bed, and Sirius, and Remus\u2019s scars and battered frame, and he knew she was remembering every time he had been tired, or missed a lesson, or had a new scratch. The light of truth flashed her her eyes, and she burst into tears. \u201cYou fucking bastard.\u201d"

You said you\u2019d never worked with one before!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t blame her, Marlene please\u2026\u201d Remus said, sitting down on the bed again, feeling a bit woozy, \u201cShe was only trying to protect me!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow long?!\u201d Marlene spun around and glared at him again.\n\n\n\u201c... since I was five.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBastard!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMarlene, please\u2026\u201d\n\n\nShe flung a piece of parchment down on the bed. It was a letter, folded up and a bit dog-eared from all the fuss. Remus reached for it with shaking hands. Marlene stood there, stone-faced, waiting for him to read it.\n\n\nHe unfolded it and looked down, and tried his hardest. Most of the time now, he had no trouble at all reading. But he was still very tired, and so nervous that all of a sudden he felt eleven years old again, the letters seeming to shift and change as he tried to make sense of them.\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he shook his head, \u201cSorry, I\u2019ve got a headache, what does it\u2026 er\u2026?\u201d\n\n\nSirius took it from him, and in doing so, placed himself conspicuously between Remus and Marlene. He cleared his throat, frowning a bit.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s from Danny McKinnon\u2026 bloody hell, Moony, what have you done?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPlease just tell me what it says,\u201d Remus shook his head, leaning forward and cradling his forehead in his hands. He really was getting a headache. Marlene was tapping her foot impatiently, and Madam Pomfrey was still hovering, obviously unsure whether or not to pull rank on this whole situation.\n\n\nSirius scanned the page, much more comfortable with all the attention.\n\n\n\u201cHe says \u2018thank you\u2019.\u201d He said.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Remus looked up, squinting,\n\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s the\n\n\ngist\n\n\n\u2026\u201d Sirius replied, still reading, \u201c...He received a letter when he arrived home this morning from one of Marlene\u2019s friends, who \u2018claims to be a werewolf\u2019. It had a lot of useful advice, and he\u2019d like to meet you. He says he won\u2019t tell anybody, and he has no idea who you are anyway.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut I do.\u201d Marlene said. She had stopped crying now, and her voice was a bit calmer, but Remus could feel the heat of emotion radiating from her.\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Remus nodded, his neck stiff, \u201cI knew you\u2019d work it out.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd you sent the letter anyway?\u201d She faltered for a moment.\n\n\n\u201cI wanted to help.\u201d He shrugged.\n\n\nThere was a long pause. Remus would have liked to lie down, but felt that it wouldn\u2019t be well received.\n\n\n\u201cDumbledore knows? And McGonagall?\u201d Marlene was speaking much more quietly now, as if she could hardly believe it.\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so dangerous.\u201d She whispered, \u201cYou could have killed someone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sirius said, hands on his hips, \u201cIt\u2019s all been perfectly safe, ever since first year, hasn\u2019t it, Poppy? Remus would never hurt anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Marlene met his eyes, \u201cBut the wolf might.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t, not ever.\u201d Remus felt the need to confirm. \u201cWe\u2019ve done everything possible.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you registered?\u201d She snapped.\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 well\n\n\nalmost\n\n\neverything possible.\u201d He conceded.\n\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2026 you just wanted to help Danny? You weren\u2019t trying to\u2026 I don\u2019t know, get him on side?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat side are you talking about, McKinnon?!\u201d Sirius stepped forward, threateningly, \u201cMoony\u2019s on\n\n\nour\n\n\nside. He\u2019s your\n\n\nfriend\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI thought he was.\u201d Marlene replied. She wasn\u2019t afraid of Sirius; she could best him on the quidditch pitch any day, and Madam Pomfrey was standing right there.\n\n\n\u201cI had to keep it secret, Marlene,\u201d Remus pleaded, the tension too unbearable, \u201cI had to, otherwise I could never have come to Hogwarts at all. You know what it\u2019s like when there\u2019s something\u2026 different about you. You know what\n\n\npeople\n\n\nare like.\u201d\n\n\nHe met her eye as he said this, and saw her turn cold with fear as it dawned on her exactly what he was alluding to.\n\n\n\u201cHow dare you.\u201d She said. \u201cHow\n\n\ndare\n\n\nyou.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean--\u201d He held his hands up, but it was too late.\n\n\n\u201cStay away from my family!\u201d She snapped, before turning on her heel and storming away, in much the same way as she had arrived.\n\n\nRemus exhaled. He didn\u2019t really feel afraid, though he had no idea what Marlene planned to do next. He wondered vaguely if he could do his NEWT exams by correspondence - or if the Potters would let him stay at theirs without James or Sirius being there. But his head was too much of a muddle to make a proper plan, and he thought he\u2019d rather just get some sleep while he could.\n\n\nHe lay back down on the bed, Madam Pomfrey and Sirius watching him.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ok.\u201d He said, \u201cHonestly. Just going to have a little rest.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to speak to Professor McGonagall at once.\u201d Madam Pomfrey said, finally.\n\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d Remus said, sleepily, closing his eyes, \u201cYou might be better off talking to Marlene, once she\u2019s calmed down. She respects your opinion. Don\u2019t get her in trouble, she hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d\n\n\nMadam Pomfrey gave him a very soft look, then, and came over to smooth his bedsheets a bit, touching his hand gently before leaving.\n\n\n\u201cHasn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d Sirius muttered, scuffing his feet against the flagstone floor. \u201cShe\u2019s being a bigoted little cow.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an uncommon point of view,\u201d Remus sighed, \u201cI might as well get used to it some time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI ought to go and--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus said, sharply, \u201cLeave her alone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut she\u2019s going to--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to talk to her friends, first.\u201d Remus said, firmly. \u201cLily and Mary. I\u2019d rather she talked to them. They\u2019re the best people in this situation.\u201d He yawned.\n\n\n\u201cBloody hell, Moony.\u201d Sirius shook his head. \u201cHow can you be so calm?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m knackered.\u201d Remus replied. And it was the last thing he said for hours.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThe thing was, whichever way it went, Remus couldn\u2019t see much of a future for himself at Hogwarts anyway. He was grateful, obviously, for everything Dumbledore, McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey had done for him. He\u2019d loved every one of his subjects (except Potions, maybe) and above all he had a group of friends who were dearer to him than any family would ever be. But the good things would stay good, if he had to go.\n\n\nHe might have more time to spend with Hope. More time to dedicate to winning this terrible war. Remus was no longer really learning anything at school that he hadn\u2019t already got from books. He yearned for practical experience; he wanted to be\n\n\ntruly\n\n\ntested. You didn\u2019t need NEWTs for that, just a well stocked library and enough nerve. Remus had everything he needed now, to do the thing he had wanted to do almost all his life.\n\n\nIf Marlene got him dismissed from school, then Remus was finally free to seek out Greyback.\n\n\nThe idea had been ticking away ever since he learnt the werewolf's name. And that night he\u2019d written to Danny, everything seemed very clear.\n\n\nIt was the thing he was born to do. Almost as if he had inherited the task from Lyall.\n\n\nGawky, insignificant, second-class Remus Lupin was never going to bring down anyone so insidiously terrible and all powerful as Lord Voldemort. But the wolf in him knew he might have a chance at Fenrir Greyback. Remus knew it might kill him, but he was bloody well going to do some damage first.\n\n\nHe\u2019d said nothing to Sirius about this. As far as they\u2019d come together, Remus was deeply ashamed of his own desire for revenge; his inability to tame that reckless rage. Sirius looked to him for self control; for a reasonable, measured response, and Remus wasn\u2019t about to shatter that illusion and risk ruining everything that worked about their dynamic.\n\n\nAnyway, Remus was eighteen now, and muggle or wizard, he could make choices for himself, no matter how dangerous. And if it took upsetting Marlene to kick everything off, then at least he\u2019d been able to help her brother in some small way. One of Matron\u2019s fatalistic catchphrases popped into his head, then: \u201c\n\n\nno good deed goes unpunished\u201d.\n\n\nThough what good deeds Matron had ever done, he didn\u2019t know.\n\n\nIt was dinner time, when he woke for the second time that day. Sirius wasn\u2019t there any more, but the marauder\u2019s map was tucked under Remus\u2019s pillow. He withdrew it and saw that the marauders were all in the common room, Mary and Lily close by. There was a chicken pie on a plate by his bedside, magically kept warm somehow - Remus hadn\u2019t worked it out yet, maybe a charm on the plate?\n\n\nHe decided he would eat before anything else, and did so in silence, thinking at a mile a minute, as if his brain was making up for all the time he\u2019d wasted sleeping. He scanned the map for Marlene. She was in the girls\u2019 dorm, with Yaz.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t know if that was good or bad. No angry mobs had come by brandishing pitchforks yet, which was probably a good sign. Madam Pomfrey came over just as he was finishing his second slice of millionaire shortbread. The thick oozy caramel was very comforting.\n\n\n\u201cHow are you feeling, dear?\u201d She asked, deep frown lines in her face.\n\n\n\u201cFine!\u201d He said, brightly. He held out the plate to her, \u201cWant one? I\u2019ll never eat them all.\u201d This was a lie and they both knew it, but Madam Pomfrey was polite enough to go along with him.\n\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 as there\u2019s no one else on the ward today,\u201d she smiled, sitting in the chair beside him and accepting a sweet. She conjured up two saucers, then poured steaming hot tea from her wand, and it was all very pleasant, but Remus could feel a Big Talk coming on.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go, after this,\u201d he said, \u201cGet out of your hair.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re never any trouble, Remus,\u201d she replied kindly, blowing on her tea to cool it. \u201cEven when you were a little boy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was a right little git, in first year.\u201d Remus countered. She smiled and shook her head,\n\n\n\u201cNot at all. A diamond in the rough.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d He said, feeling himself heat up. Anyone else he\u2019d have told to \u2018shuddup\u2019 or \u2018piss off\u2019, but he would never, ever have a rude word to say to Madam Pomfrey.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s flown by, the last few years,\u201d she sighed, \u201cI remember that little scrap of a thing you were; all eyes and elbows. You\u2019ve grown into a fine young man.\u201d\n\n\nHe wished she\u2019d stop, as nice as all of this was; he didn\u2019t know what to do with it. \u201cAnd you deserve every success, Remus, do you hear me?\u201d She continued, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy for you, after school - and I know you know that.\u201d\n\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be ok.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou will.\u201d She smiled, her eyes brightening with tears, \u201cAnd if you ever need anything, you know where to reach me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI knew Danny McKinnon, you know,\u201d She said, clearing her throat,\n\n\nhere it comes,\n\n\nRemus thought. But she\u2019d cunningly overpowered him with all that nice stuff, and he just had to grit his teeth and listen now.\n\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d He said, casually, taking another slice of cake.\n\n\n\u201cYes, when he was a student here. Had him in here a hundred times for patching up - he was Gryffindor Beater, like Marlene. He was a bit more outgoing than she is.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Remus returned, dryly, \u201cShe\u2019s hardly a shrinking violet.\u201d\n\n\nMadam Pomfrey smirked, despite herself,\n\n\n\u201cNo, quite. She has that McKinnon tenacity, and a keen sense of right and wrong.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe does.\u201d He sighed. He\u2019d always liked that about Marlene; her straightforwardness, \u201cAnd I know what you\u2019re going to say - that everything isn\u2019t that simple, that there are shades of grey, and that it doesn\u2019t matter what people\n\n\nthink\n\n\nabout you, it matters what you do\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 yes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know all that, and it\u2019s fine. I knew all that when I wrote to Danny, I even know how Marlene would react. But in the end, it didn't matter. The only thing that mattered was helping him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Remus.\u201d\n\n\nThat threw him for a loop. His throat constricted, and he almost choked trying to swallow the last of his slice, the sugar turning to acid on its way down. He spluttered and coughed, reaching for the tea to wash it down. Madam Pomfrey got up, smiling. She patted him on the shoulder as he recovered.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you get on.\u201d\n\n\nHe took a few moment to compose himself before getting up. He brushed the crumbs from the sheets and made the bed, though he knew he didn't really need to. The rest of the sweets he wrapped up into some parchment and carefully slid the package into his bag. He might need them, later.\n\n\nRemus was almost surprised by how calm he felt. There was a sense of closing; of coming to an inevitable end. Someone was always going to find out, he told himself. He\u2019d have been an idiot to think they could all hide such a big thing forever. They\u2019d done a bloody good job, but it had all been luck, and they\u2019d taken so many risks. At least this way, it had been Remus\u2019s choice; he\u2019d controlled it as much as he could. This way, the marauders were safe too. No one would know what they\u2019d all been up to every full moon.\n\n\nHe made his way slowly back to Gryffindor Tower. He was all stiff from sleeping all day, and was grateful for the opportunity to stretch his legs in privacy. Sirius hadn\u2019t mentioned the hip problem for a while, but Remus saw him purse his lips, or frown whenever he noticed Remus limping or rubbing his side.\n\n\n\u201cBlatherskite,\u201d he said to the fat lady, who barely looked up from filing her fingernails to let him through.\n\n\nHe entered the room and felt six pairs of eyes on him at once. Steeling himself and pasting on a careless smile, he approached his friends, sitting in their usual place, taking up two sofas and an armchair.\n\n\n\u201cMoony!\u201d Sirius got up from where he\u2019d been sprawling to make room, \u201cI was just going to come up and see if you were awake.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m awake,\u201d he said redundantly, taking his seat.\n\n\n\u201cSirius told us what you did.\u201d Peter said, as if he couldn\u2019t contain himself. He was fiddling with a chess piece - there was a game going on, but Remus couldn\u2019t tell who Peter was playing.\n\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Remus nodded. \u201cEr\u2026 anyone spoken to Marlene?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe got yelled at,\u201d Mary sighed, indicating herself and Lily. \u201cI think she's mostly hurt that she was the last to find out.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe's not said much else, though. Been locked away with Yaz.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cListen, Moony,\u201d James leaned over, eyes very serious, \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking, and remember fifth year? Dumbledore stopped Snape from telling everyone. He can stop Marlene too, if it comes to that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe might.\u201d Remus nodded, though he wasn\u2019t so sure. He might serve Dumbledore better out of school now than he could have at sixteen. Especially considering the contacts Remus had already made. \u201cBut leave him out if it for now, ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy did you\n\n\ndo\n\n\nit?!\u201d Peter asked, still clutching the chess piece.\n\n\n\u201cTo help Danny.\u201d Remus replied, surprised. He looked at all if them, \u201cHe was alone, no one was helping him, Marlene told me that herself.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut Remus\u2026\u201d Lily said, \u201cYou knew how she would feel about it. You knew she wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI knew that. But it was for Danny.\u201d Remus repeated, firmly.\n\n\nThey all promised to give it time, and see what Marlene decided to do next. Lily and Mary vowed that they would do everything they could, that night in their dorm, they would explain, try to convince her. Remus thanked them, because he knew how much they cared about him.\n\n\nThey had a quiet evening. Remus played chess with Peter and lost, then Sirius took over and they tied. James and Lily quizzed each other on potion ingredients and Mary half heartedly worked on job applications.\n\n\n\u201cHalf boring muggle secretarial stuff to please mum and half boring ministry of magic stuff to please McGonagall,\u201d She sighed.\n\n\nEventually they went to bed, one by one, and though Remus had barely been awake for three hours that day, he climbed the stairs yawning. Sirius had been very patient. He hadn\u2019t said so much as a word yet, and Remus knew how difficult that must be for him. So when they were finally in bed, and as alone as they could ever be at Hogwarts, he lay quietly on his back and stares up at the velvet hangings, and let Sirius speak.\n\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t let her do this.\u201d Sirius whispered into his ear, reaching for his hand, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her, Mary and Lily\u2019ll talk to her, and we\u2019ll make her understand. McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey - they\u2019ll want to help you, she'll listen to them if she won\u2019t listen to her friends. Or Dumbledore. James could kick her off the team -\n\n\nanything\n\n\n. We won\u2019t lose you, Moony, you\u2019ve worked too hard, you\u2019re not getting kicked out just for trying to be nice to that ungrateful, stuck up, intolerant\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt's going to be ok, Padfoot.\u201d Remus said.\n\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d Sirius nodded, his hair rustling against the pillow, \u201cExactly, because we\u2019re going to stop her.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I mean - it doesn\u2019t matter what happens; it's going to be ok. If I leave in three months or I have to go tomorrow, everything will still be ok.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut your NEWTs!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell I\n\n\nwas\n\n\nlooking forward to completely destroying you in History and Charms\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd Arithmancy, I\u2019ve been copying off you all year.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd Arithmancy.\u201d Remus laughed. \u201cBut\u2026 well the NEWTs don\u2019t mean much. I still won\u2019t be able to enter any of the ministry training programmes without registering as a werewolf - and I\u2019m not going to do that, not ever. I dunno if I even really want to do that sort of job. What I\n\n\nwant\n\n\nis to start changing things. That's why I wrote to Danny in the first place.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...you mean you\n\n\nwant\n\n\nto get kicked out?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will come to that. I don\u2019t think Marlene would, even if she\u2019s angry. But she might ask me to leave, and if it's what she wants, then I will.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd join the war.\u201d Sirius finished. His voice sounded strange. Not bad, but Remus knew he understood.\n\n\n\u201cYes, I suppose you could put it that way.\u201d Remus nodded.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come with you, then. I don\u2019t need NEWTs either, I\u2019m a Black.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI wouldn't ask you to do that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know. But I will. We\u2019ll go together.\u201d\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t want to admit it, but he was quietly thrilled. Perhaps it was the Gryffindor part of him, but leaving childhood behind and rushing head first into the unknown with his best friend sounded so gloriously tempting. It would be the making of them; away from Hogwarts and schedules and all of the silly little feuds and rivalries there. They had so much to offer, he knew it. Hadn\u2019t they triumphed in everything they\u2019d ever attempted? Weren\u2019t they the heroes of every story so far? It would be nothing at all to them. They could end this war and really begin their lives.\n\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d He rolled over to kiss Sirius. He kissed his lips and his hands slid under his nightshirt and he kept kissing him, his lips, his neck, his jaw, \u201cThank you, thank you\u2026\u201d"

            "content": "They were wonderful promises, but it wasn\u2019t to be. Remus would not have the chance to make a mysterious and dignified early exit from Hogwarts, and Sirius would not get the opportunity to prove he would follow his Moony anywhere.\n\n\n\n\nLater - after the war was over and everything else was over too - Remus would wonder whether things might have gone differently if he and Sirius had left school then. Perhaps they could have kept each other closer, or by removing themselves they could have kept other people safer.\n\n\n\n\nAnyway. It didn\u2019t happen, and it did no good to dwell on.\n\n\n\n\nFor years and years afterwards, once the agony of all those funerals and obituaries and memorials and speeches had faded, Remus would be left with memories of his last months at Hogwarts, when they had been stupid and naive and indescribably happy without even knowing it.\n\n\n\n\nWednesday 29th March 1978\n\n\nThe weekend passed quietly; there was homework to complete and quidditch to train for and an enormously complicated prank to plan, and Marlene did not make a move in any direction.\n\n\nSirius and James reported that she attended quidditch practice, and played as well as she ever had, but hadn't spoken to them. Mary said she was still upset, but that she hadn\u2019t made her mind up whether or not to tell.\n\n\nThey were well into the next week by the time Marlene finally decided to approach Remus again. She caught him alone - which was rare, these days.\n\n\nHe was tidying up the Charms classroom following a revision session, just before the Wednesday \u2018inter-house-prank-planning-co-operative\u2019 meeting. Usually Chris helped, but he was down with a head cold, and had taken the afternoon off. Remus had half wanted to call off the group altogether. It all seemed so futile; learning and learning and learning - for what? To pass an exam, get a good mark, and then? If Greyback didn\u2019t kill him before he was twenty then he would still be unemployable. But everyone seemed to like the study groups, and he hated letting them down.\n\n\nShe entered the room smelling of herbs from the greenhouse - rosemary and sage and rich earthy soil. He turned, and unconsciously backed himself against a wall.\n\n\n\u201cHello.\u201d He said.\n\n\nShe stood still for a while, staring at him in total silence, before replying.\n\n\n\u201cHello. I\u2019m furious with you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d He nodded, trying to be understanding, \u201cI think that\u2019s fair enough. Are\u2026 um. Are you ready to talk about it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d She shot, folding her arms. She glared at him, and he averted his eyes, like a supplicant begging forgiveness. He heard her fidget a bit, and sigh impatiently. \u201cBut Danny says I have to.\u201d\n\n\nRemus consciously avoided smiling, but couldn\u2019t ignore the flood of relief he felt at those words. He looked up again, carefully.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve spoken to him properly, then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes. He said he tried the murtlap essence combined with muggle TCP, and he\u2019s healing faster. And you were right about taking a sleeping draught.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best thing, I\u2019ve found. For healing.\u201d Remus replied, warily, averting his eyes again. She made him feel so ashamed of himself.\n\n\n\u201cEveryone knew except me.\u201d Marlene said. She was leaning against the opposite wall now; the whole room between them, the jumble of chairs and desks. \u201cEven Mary.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe worked it out, I didn\u2019t tell her.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI always thought you were weird because you were queer.\u201d\n\n\nHe frowned a bit. Was he weird? He didn\u2019t say anything, he couldn\u2019t think of anything that would make it better.\n\n\n\u201cYou really hurt my feelings, Remus.\u201d Marlene continued, \u201cYou lied to me for years. I thought we were friends, I shared things with you I haven\u2019t told anyone else.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe are friends!\u201d Remus protested, \u201cI\u2019m\n\n\nyour\n\n\nfriend, anyway.\u201d\n\n\nHe sighed heavily. Would it always be like this, when people found out? \u201cLook, I couldn\u2019t tell you; there were too many people involved\u2026 Madam Pomfrey, and even Dumbledore. I had to keep it quiet for their sakes, too. And\u2026 you\u2019ve made it quite clear, in the past, how you feel about people like me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou should have\n\n\ntold\n\n\nme.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat would you have done?\u201d Remus was getting annoyed now. \u201cComplained? Told everyone? Got me expelled?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI might not have.\u201d She bit her lip and looked away. The less certain she was, the more angry Remus grew.\n\n\n\u201cWell I didn\u2019t much fancy taking the risk!\u201d He said, \u201cI haven\u2019t got a family, or a real home to go to, in case you\u2019d forgotten. I haven\u2019t got\n\n\nanything\n\n\ngoing for me outside of this school, so forgive me for doing everything I could to stay.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI understand that,\u201d She looked up, quickly, reaching her hands out, \u201c--and I\u2019d never want to cause you any trouble, but\n\n\nRemus\n\n\n, can\u2019t you see how dangerous--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was eleven! I was only a kid, and this old man shows up and tells me I\u2019m going to magic school - what would\n\n\nyou\n\n\nhave done?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t shout at me!\u201d She frowned, shrinking a bit. \u201cI didn\u2019t come to shout.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d He muttered. \u201cI didn\u2019t get my chance the other day.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\n\nThey were quiet after that, both looking at the ground, both fidgeting with their hands. Remus could hear Marlene\u2019s heart thudding in a steady, anxious rhythm.\n\n\n\u201cLook.\u201d He said, keeping his voice low and steady, unclenching his fists. \u201cIf you want me to leave Hogwarts, then I will. As long as you\n\n\npromise\n\n\nnot to get anyone else in trouble, I\u2019m not going to put up a fight.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut your NEWTs\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t matter if you\u2019re going to tell everyone how dangerous I am.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou sound like Danny.\u201d\n\n\nQuiet again. Remus shook his head, tired and exasperated. He tried a different tack.\n\n\n\u201cHow is he, now? The letter said he wanted to meet me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe's ok.\u201d She nodded, her eyes a bit bright. \u201cI think it cheered him up, knowing that someone else was going through the same thing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus nodded, \u201cIt's something I would have liked. James and Sirius and Pete\u2026 they\u2019ve always made sure I never felt alone. So I know how much of a difference it makes.\u201d\n\n\nMarlene nodded and wiped her eyes.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m angry.\u201d She said, tiredly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m angry with you. You just\u2026 it was such a shock, and I\u2019m not sure how many more shocks I can take, these days.\u201d\n\n\nHe laughed, and didn\u2019t really know why.\n\n\nShe smiled, weakly. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything. I don\u2019t want you to go anywhere. Danny says\u2026 he says we need to focus on our similarities, not our differences. Now more than ever. Lily and Mary said the same. I know they\u2019re right, it\u2019s just harder than I expected.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t have you hating me.\u201d He said, warily.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate\n\n\nyou\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHating what I am is the same thing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying, Remus.\u201d She blinked away tears. \u201cI swear, I\u2019ll try.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d He nodded.\n\n\nFor a split second he was disappointed; he\u2019d been so ready for a change. Knowing he\u2019d have to wait a bit longer stung for a moment, but dissipated quickly, like a door closing. That was that. He would finish school and beat everyone in History - Arithmancy too, probably - and watch the final quidditch game, and get too drunk celebrating with his friends. Greyback would wait.\n\n\n\u201cCan I help you with this?\u201d Marlene gestured at the messy classroom. \u201cPotter and Black and their gang of miscreants will be here in a minute to plan their raid on Slytherin\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, ok,\u201d Remus nodded, and they both began moving the desks. The confrontation seemed to be over, and for now they were both satisfied. He was glad; it had been awful not having Marlene as a friend.\n\n\nRemus and Chris usually used magic to move the classroom furniture back, but Marlene had never been good at locomotion spells, so she just started lifting and pushing things. Remus didn\u2019t want to show off now that they were back on tentative talking terms, so he did his best to match her.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to talk to Mary.\u201d Marlene said, suddenly, lifting a chair and pushing it under a desk. \u201cYaz wants me to. I told Danny already.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat's good.\u201d Remus smiled, encouragingly. \u201cI\u2019m sure Mary will be fine. She\u2019s the least judgmental person I know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah you\u2019re probably right.\u201d Marlene watched him, thoughtfully as he moved the final table back into place. \u201cRemus?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs your limp because of the transformations?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAm I limping?\u201d Remus stood a bit straighter, self conscious.\n\n\n\u201cSometimes more than others,\u201d she replied, matter of factly. \u201cI always thought\u2026 with your upbringing. Someone did it to you.\u201d\n\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\n\u201cWhen I was thirteen or so, I think something clicked back into place a bit wonky.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cGets a bit stiff now and then. I hardly think about it now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMmm.\u201d She replied, looking thoughtful.\n\n\n\u201c--\n\n\nHow many times\n\n\n?!\u201d\n\n\nThe door flew open and Lily entered, looking furious, James trailing behind her, Peter and Sirius close behind, both smirking. \u201cWe said\n\n\nno pranks\n\n\nuntil the end of term! We\u2019re supposed to be keeping a low profile, you\u2019re\n\n\nHead Boy\n\n\n!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Evans,\u201d James said, hands out, \u201cThat was nothing, barely even a prank, it was\u2026 er\u2026\u201d he cast a pleading glance at Sirius,\n\n\n\u201cHigh spirits!\u201d Sirius supplied.\n\n\n\u201cHigh spirits!\u201d James nodded, grinning.\n\n\n\u201cAll of the bathroom mirrors suddenly reflecting back\n\n\ntroll faces\n\n\nis high spirits?!\u201d Lily rounded on them both.\n\n\nIt was no good, all three boys collapsed into peals of laughter.\n\n\nRemus sniggered too; he\u2019d done half the research for that one. The week before he\u2019d spent hours searching through books of troll dynasty histories for portraits to get all the features right. He hoped he\u2019d get a chance to catch some of the reactions before Flitwick managed to break the glamour spell they\u2019d used.\n\n\n\u201cYou nutters.\u201d Marlene smiled shyly.\n\n\n\u201cMarlene!\u201d Lily gasped.\n\n\nThey all turned to look at her, and then to Remus, agape. He made a point of smiling back at them all, relaxing his shoulders and clapping his hands together.\n\n\n\u201cCome on then! This co-operative isn\u2019t going to run itself\u2026\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nSirius still had some opinions about Marlene, of course. Remus refused to hear them. He wanted the matter closed, he wanted to move on. And he wanted to meet Danny, as soon as he possibly could. For the first time, for better or for worse, Remus felt he had an ally out there. Someone who was like him, on their side. He wrote another letter, then scrapped it and tried again. Then again, and again. There was so much to say Remus wasn\u2019t sure where to start.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you want to talk to him for, though?\u201d Sirius yawned one night in bed, as Remus gave up on another attempt to properly introduce himself. \u201cYou know more about being a werewolf than he does, it's not as if he\u2019ll have any special insight.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt's not really about that.\u201d Remus yawned back, putting out his wand light and lying down. He rubbed the knuckles and fingers on his right hand. Some days he felt as if he never put his quill down; he was always writing, if not feverishly revising his notes for NEWTs, then making complex calculations in aid of the big prank, or writing to Grant or Ferox or Danny.\n\n\n\u201cWait until school\u2019s finished, then.\u201d Sirius advised. \u201cSafer for both of you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere are three moons between now and then.\u201d Remus replied, trying to get comfortable. The sheets always ended up wrinkled in Sirius\u2019s bed, he had no idea how the other boy managed it.\n\n\n\u201cI know that,\u201d Sirius replied, indignantly. \u201cBut there\u2019s not much you can do, is there?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cS\u2019pose not.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t owe him anything.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus chose his words carefully. \u201cBut I owe it to myself to do the right thing, don\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs that what got into your head?\u201d Sirius was frowning, Remus could tell.\n\n\nA flutter in his belly told him they were heading for a fight, and he could avert it right now by just changing the subject.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018what got into my head\u2019?!\u201d Remus snapped.\n\n\n\u201cWhen you wrote to Danny in the first place. You\u2019ve got to admit it was a bit reckless.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell for someone who\u2019s spent seven years trying to keep every aspect of himself completely private, it was a bit bonkers to just go and send a letter to a stranger--\u201d\n\n\n\u201c--my friend\u2019s\n\n\nbrother--\n\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201c--spilling your guts about\n\n\neverything--\n\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot everything!\u201d\n\n\n\u201c--but if it was all in the service of doing the right thing, then I suppose that\u2019s\n\n\nfine\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLook, if you\u2019re pissed off with me then just say so, this sarcastic crap doesn\u2019t suit you, Black.\u201d Remus rolled over onto his side.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not pissed off.\u201d Sirius said.\n\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\n\nRemus knew that wasn\u2019t the end of it. He waited, practically champing at the bit.\n\n\n\u201c...I\u2019ve just been thinking, that\u2019s all.\u201d Sirius said, finally. Remus smirked to himself, before rolling back over, frowning,\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you wanted to leave, or something.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cObviously I wanted to leave,\u201d Remus hissed, going in, \u201cI told you. It\u2019s pointless, me doing NEWTs, pissing about with silly exams and clubs and pranks, when things are happening out there,\n\n\nright now\n\n\n. I had a chance to help, and I took it. So what if I didn\u2019t care about the consequences?! Calling me reckless?! I thought\n\n\nyou\u2019d\n\n\nunderstand! What happened to wanting to get back at your family? What happened to wanting to put a stop to it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI do want to\u2026\u201d Sirius said, sounding smaller.\n\n\n\u201cWell you\u2019re not acting like it. You seem more fussed about that stupid quidditch match than the war. Maybe they\u2019re the same thing to you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMerlin!\u2019 Sirius replied, weakly, \u201cYou don\u2019t stop until you\u2019ve tasted blood, do you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMust be the wolf in me.\u201d Remus said, shortly.\n\n\nHe rolled over again and shut his eyes."

I\u2019m really, really happy to hear from you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cChrist, you get posher by the day.\u201d\n\n\nRemus laughed, despite himself. The sound echoed back through the receiver, and made him think about Grant\u2019s voice travelling all the way through the telephone wire, from the very bottom of England, up through to him in the Scottish Highlands. Muggles were pretty magic too, really.\n\n\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d He asked, \u201cStill enjoying the seaside?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWinter was fucking dire.\u201d Grant replied, settling into the conversation. Remus could hear the cigarette between his teeth, the\n\n\ngrind-click\n\n\nof a zippo lighter. He longed to see the other boy, to see his face and watch his expressions. \u201cRain. Freezing cold wind - it comes in off the sea, rattles the windows worse than at St Eddy\u2019s. Mind you, the students made up for it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStudents?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAt the Art College, and Brighton Poly. You get loads of our sort, at art schools. I was seeing an engineer, a poet and a painter.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs that three separate people, or one very clever person?\u201d Remus asked, wryly.\n\n\n\u201cCheeky beggar. Wouldn\u2019t you like to know.\u201d Grant snickered. \u201cWhat about you, anyway? How\u2019s lover boy?\u201d\n\n\nRemus snorted derisively.\n\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\n\nGrant exhaled loudly.\n\n\n\u201cLord, not another fight, is it? Tell you what, sweetheart, you want to get on top of these moods of yours.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat moods?!\u201d Remus frowned. Grant laughed,\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the moodiest bloke I know, worse than a girl on the blob when something\u2019s pissed you off. And you \u2018aven\u2019t half got a mouth on ya. I\u2019ve \u2018ad broken ribs hurt less than some things you\u2019ve said.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou never said\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, well, I let you get away with it because it's easier than picking a fight. \u2018sides, it\u2019s not your fault. I'm the same, in\u2019t I? We all are, institutionalised kids.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cInstitutionalised?!\u201d\n\n\nIt was an enormous word coming from Grant, but it felt rude to say so.\n\n\nGod,\n\n\nRemus thought to himself,\n\n\nwhen did I become such a snob?\n\n\n\n\u201cYep, \u2018pparently that\u2019s what we are. The poet told me - \u2018e was doing a course in psychology. Said I\u2019m afraid to stay with one person too long \u2018cos I was abandoned too much when I was small. Dumped him after that, obviously.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been with Sirius for ages.\u201d Remus replied, defensively. \u201cIt\u2019s only ever been him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGot the same problem, though.\u201d Grant mused, as though they were just passing the time of day, \u201cWhen was the last time you let anyone be nice to you without saying something 'orrible back?\u201d\n\n\nRemus pressed his lips together.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do that.\u201d He said, though he already knew Grant was right. Bastard.\n\n\n\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Grant returned, casually. \u201cHow\u2019s everything else, anyway?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI met my mother.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCrikey.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah. She\u2019s ok.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat what\u2019s got you all moody?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo. Maybe.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t blame you if it was. I lose it for weeks after I see mine. Loves telling me how much she hates me.\u201d He always sounded as if he was smiling, even as he said this. It made it more unpleasant somehow.\n\n\n\u201cWell. Mine didn\u2019t say that.\u201d Remus said. \u201cActually, she said she loves me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice, then.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it back, y\u2019know. She dumped you, the callous cow, she\u2019s got no right to expect it.\u201d\n\n\nRemus reeled back a little at that, shocked.\n\n\n\u201cShe had her reasons. Anyway, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t feel anything for her. It\u2019s just hard to say. S\u2019pose your psychologist friend would think that\u2019s down to me being \u2018institutionalised\u2019.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cS\u2019pose so.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut you never had a problem. With, er\u2026 affection.\u201d\n\n\nGrant laughed again, a joyful cackle.\n\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t reckon shagging every lad who looks at me sideways is a problem.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI just meant you\u2019re more\n\n\nopen\n\n\n\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus couldn\u2019t go on, Grant\u2019s laughter was drowning everything out.\n\n\n\u201cSorry!\u201d He wheezed, \u201cGawd, I forgot how funny you were.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI thought I was moody.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a complicated man, Remus bloody Lupin. S\u2019why I love you.\u201d\n\n\nRemus groaned. Grant laughed again. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, not in a queer way.\u201d\n\n\nThat made Remus laugh, and for a good few minutes after that laughter was all that passed between them, through miles and miles of telephone wire.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nRemus walked back to Hogsmeade with a lighter step than he\u2019d had an hour before. Just talking to someone outside of Hogwarts, someone outside of the war, was a wonderful relief.\n\n\n(\u201cI wish there was a phone at school I could use,\u201d he\u2019d said, apologetically, \u201cI\u2019d call you all the time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re eccentric millionaires,\u201d Grant mused, \u201cWe can pay someone to carry a phone around for us, everywhere we go. The engineer said they\u2019ll be able to do that, maybe by the eighties.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how that would work,\u201d Remus frowned, \u201cWhere would you plug it in?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one at the posh school, you tell me.\u201d)\n\n\nHe\u2019d promised to meet the others in The Three Broomsticks after the phone call, which had taken weeks to plan. Sirius hadn\u2019t said anything when Remus headed towards the phone box outside of town - maybe a few weeks ago he\u2019d have offered to walk with him, but they still weren't being nice to each other. They weren\u2019t being nasty, but they weren\u2019t happy. It was tiring, but giving ground seemed like even harder work.\n\n\nRemus took a moment for himself before entering the pub. He smoked, leaning against the wall under the signpost. It was a bright spring day, and the first weekend he\u2019d had in ages which wasn\u2019t organised within an inch of its life. He watched the busy high street, happy students walking this way and that with their friends, shopping bags bulging and faces beaming. How different was he, from them? Was he any less?\n\n\nNot to his friends, he thought, confidently. Not to Sirius.\n\n\nSuddenly, he caught a familiar scent on the wind, and he searched the crowd quickly to find Chris, hurrying past.\n\n\n\u201cOi! Oi, Christopher!\u201d Remus called to him.\n\n\nThe mousy boy stopped, saw who was shouting, then came over - a bit reluctantly.\n\n\n\u201cHello, Remus,\u201d he nodded, looking agitated. He didn\u2019t have his usual bag of books, and his clothes were smarter than usual. He smelled slightly different too - a new soap, or\u2026 it couldn\u2019t be cologne?!\n\n\n\u201cHiya, not seen you in ages,\u201d Remus smiled down at him.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, been so busy\u2026 then I had that cold, remember?\u201d \u00a0Christopher didn\u2019t quite meet his eyes. He was blushing; but Christopher was always blushing, so Remus didn\u2019t put much stock in it.\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah, feeling better?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, thanks.\n\n\n\u201cCome in, the others are all inside\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 no, sorry, Remus, um. I\u2019m meeting someone\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Remus looked him up and down again. Well now it made a bit more sense. \u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cErm. Not anyone you know\u2026 sorry, but\u2026 do you mind? I\u2019m going to be late.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Course! Sorry\u2026\u201d Remus said, a little bit annoyed. Christopher had never brushed him off like that before. He watched him hurry off down the street and turn a corner.\n\n\nFine.\n\n\nRemus stubbed out his cigarette in the pot of red geraniums on the doorstep of the pub, then pushed the door open and entered. James, Lily, Mary, Peter, Marlene and Yaz were sitting in a booth in the far corner, the table laden with empty glasses.\n\n\nHe smiled walking over to them, ducking his head under the low black ceiling beams and raising a hand in greeting.\n\n\n\u201cMoony!\u201d James grinned, waving back. Peter and Mary moved along on the plush green velvet seat to make room for him.\n\n\n\u201cHow was your phone call?\u201d Lily asked, brightly.\n\n\n\u201cGood, thanks.\u201d Remus nodded. \u201cWhat have you lot been up to?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPlanning the end of year party.\u201d Mary smiled eagerly.\n\n\n\u201cMy folks said they\u2019ll host.\u201d James said. \u201cWe\u2019ll invite the whole year. Most of them, anyway\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSounds great.\u201d Remus grinned back.\n\n\nThings had been awkward between all of them, because it was painfully obvious that he and Sirius were fighting. Lily tried to be practical and act as if she was above it all, but James was perpetually caught between them, and never knew where to look.\n\n\n\u201cRight, come and get them\u2026!\u201d Sirius suddenly appeared over James\u2019s shoulder from the bar, a tray of pints in his arms. He looked up and saw Remus, and the smile died on his lips.\n\n\nEveryone looked away, embarrassed, and Remus felt something harden in his chest. A stream of scathing one-liners flashed up in his mind; spiteful, sharp things. It took an enormous effort to push them down. He didn\u2019t want it to be easier to be cruel than kind. He refused to be that kind of person. St Edmund\u2019s couldn't be all he ever was.\n\n\n\u201cHiya,\u201d he smiled, lowering his head so that his hair fell into his eyes and he had to push the curls back. He was such a mess, he ought to get it cut.\n\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d Sirius set the tray down with a clank. \u201cI\u2019ll go back and get you--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus can have mine,\u201d Mary said, getting out of the booth, \u201cSamuel from my Charms group has been throwing me looks all afternoon\u2026 have my seat, Black.\u201d She nudged him into the seat, and Sirius gingerly took his place beside Remus.\n\n\n\u201cSee you later!\u201d Mary trilled, sashaying across the pub floor to a group of Ravenclaw boys.\n\n\nMarlene grinned and shook her head at Yaz, who laughed and squeezed her hand on top of the table. Remus\u2019s heart skipped and he glanced around furtively.\n\n\nNo one else was looking - their little booth was in an awkward corner of the room, away from the windows and poorly lit by gaslights. No doubt the privacy was why they\u2019d chosen it, Remus saw now that all of his friends were rosy cheeked and glassy eyed from beer. Lily was practically sitting in James\u2019s lap, and his right hand had vanished up the back of her jumper.\n\n\n\u201cHow was the call?\u201d Sirius asked, neutrally, looking down at his beer.\n\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d Remus replied quietly, \u201cHe sounded really well. Happy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat's nice.\u201d\n\n\nRemus took a deep swig of beer for courage. Peter was talking quidditch with Marlene and Yaz, James and Lily only had eyes for each other. He turned to Sirius, twisting sideways in the seat,\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m such a prick.\u201d He said.\n\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d Sirius drank too, still not really looking at Remus, though the corner of his lips turned up as he tilted his head back.\n\n\nThe flash of white skin on his neck as he swallowed caught Remus\u2019s attention. He budged up on the seat, closer to Sirius.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He whispered, so that only Sirius could hear him.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t talk to you about anything sometimes without you biting my head off.\u201d Sirius grumbled. \u201cYou get into these moods and I can\u2019t reach you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know\u2026\u201d Remus said, trying not to get too sidetracked by the way Sirius\u2019s adam\u2019s apple bobbed, or the way his pulse fluttered in that hollow above his collar bone, or his lovely slender wrists, and how he\u2019d love to hold them fast and\u2026\n\n\nRemus looked around once more, just in case, before leaning in even closer, pushing Sirius\u2019s hair back with his fingers and kissing that beautiful neck, flicking his tongue up, just behind his earlobe. He heard Sirius\u2019s sharp intake of breath, and the blood rushing so fast in his veins it sounded like fizzing, and Remus\u2019s own temperature began to rise.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d he said again, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault, and I\u2019ll do better.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBetter?\u201d Sirius muttered, his head bowed so that his hair fell over his face.\n\n\n\u201cBetter. I\u2019m sorry. I lose my temper when people tell me what to do, but I\u2019m going to try.\u201d\n\n\nSirius\u2019s head inclined towards him, and Remus pulled away so that they could look each other in the eye. He wasn\u2019t angry, or guarded anymore, which was a relief.\n\n\n\u201cS\u2019pose it\u2019s not really my job to tell you what to do in the first place\u2026\u201d Sirius said, giving way so easily. He couldn\u2019t hold grudges, except maybe for his family. He was too good, inside and out. Remus felt another pang of guilt at that, and it fortified his resolve. He would do everything to change; to deserve Sirius\u2019s blind loyalty.\n\n\n\u201cNo, but I don\u2019t have to be such a dick about it,\u201d Remus countered, moving back a bit more and reaching for his drink. \u201cI\u2019ll make it up yo you, I promise.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Sirius cocked an eyebrow. All things forgiven, his mind had clearly returned to its usual preoccupation.\n\n\n\u201cLater.\u201d Remus returned, imperiously, giving him a light slap on the thigh.\n\n\n\u201cSo what did Grant say?\u201d Sirius settled back comfortably into the corner of the booth. The uncomfortable part over, his posture relaxed, he rested a boot against the nearest free stool, leaning forward on his knee.\n\n\n\u201cOh, we just caught up,\u201d Remus said, swilling his beer lightly, \u201cHe\u2019s still working in Brighton, has his own flat; wants to get a car for weekends.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe could go there, after school\u2019s finished.\u201d Sirius suggested, \u201cIf you wanted? If there\u2019s time for a holiday.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Remus nodded, drinking again. None of them knew what would happen when school ended; not really. Even James and Lily were hazy on the details.\n\n\n\u201c--so I told him I\u2019d hex his bollocks off if he asked me one more time.\u201d Yaz was just saying, Marlene giggling and hiding her face in her hands,\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re awful!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell he needs to learn his lesson!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d James and Sirius both asked, neither one of them wanting to be left out of any gossip.\n\n\n\u201cUgh, Lockhart,\u201d Yaz tossed her head haughtily, her ponytail swinging.\n\n\n\u201cIs he bothering you lot again?\u201d James frowned, \u201cI told him to stay away from my team! I\u2019ll tell Flitwick--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he got the message this time,\u201d Marlene laughed, \u201cYaz is convincing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat does he want?\u201d Sirius asked.\n\n\n\u201cHe just keeps sniffing around, trying to find out what we\u2019re up to.\u201d James sighed, shaking his head, \u201cReckons he\u2019s being left out. He\u2019s like a more hygiene conscious version of Snape in fifth year.\u201d\n\n\nLily elbowed him in the ribs, which only made James laugh.\n\n\n\u201cLeft out of what?\u201d Remus frowned, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even play, and he\u2019s a Ravenclaw - they lost the last game.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMoony!\u201d Sirius exclaimed, \u201cDid you just demonstrate quidditch knowledge?!\u201d\n\n\nEverybody laughed at him, and Remus mock-sulked, drinking more beer.\n\n\n\u201cHard to avoid it in our bloody dorm.\u201d He retorted.\n\n\n\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s not the quidditch team he\u2019s interested in.\u201d James shook his head, grinning, \u201cIt\u2019s\n\n\nthe other thing\n\n\n.\u201d He said this very ominously, eyebrows knit together and casting suspicious looks around the pub. Ah, Remus thought; the prank.\n\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t asked me,\u201d Remus said, with a shrug.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019ve got everyone fooled,\u201d Marlene replied. \u201cThe whole school somehow thinks you\u2019re the mild one out of this lot.\u201d\n\n\nRemus smiled at her very sweetly.\n\n\n\u201cAre you suggesting I\u2019m not?\u201d He raised an eyebrow, grinning at her.\n\n\nBeside him, Sirius made a small strained noise in the back of his throat. His pulse still hadn\u2019t quite settled down yet.\n\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Lily stood up, draining her drink and wiping her lips on the back of her sleeve, \u201cWe\u2019ve got two hours before I\u2019ve got to start herding the prefects back, and I need to go to Scrivenshaft's before it closes. Potter?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYep, coming,\u201d James necked the dregs of his own pint.\n\n\n\u201cWe both need broom polish, if you want to come, Pete?\u201d Marlene said, kindly. Wormtail had been left out of a lot, lately; even Dorcas was ignoring him.\n\n\n\u201cGreat!\u201d He stood up eagerly, following James out of the booth.\n\n\n\u201cBlack?\u201d Marlene looked at Sirius. \u201cDidn\u2019t you want new gloves?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll order them from Quidditch Monthly.\u201d He replied, barely looking up at her.\n\n\n\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d she shrugged. There was a bit of commotion as they all got their things together and settled the bill, but finally Remus and Sirius were left alone. Remus turned to him slowly, trying to look innocent.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you fancy doing, then? Walk? Honeyduke\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhen the dorm room is guaranteed to be empty for at least two hours?!\u201d Sirius licked his lips.\n\n\n\u201cMore like an hour and a half, by the time we get up there\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBetter get a move on then.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOi,\u201d Remus smirked, standing up, hands in his pockets. \u201cI thought I told you I don\u2019t like being told what to do.\u201d\n\n\nThey walked out of the pub single file, and Remus held the door open. As Sirius edged past him, shuffling sideways, he leaned forward subtly and whispered,\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll just have to tell\n\n\nme\n\n\nwhat to do, then.\u201d\n\n\nRemus grinned."

Fuck\u2019s sake, wake up\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPiss off.\u201d Remus grumbled, shaken awake. \u201cS\u2019the middle of the night.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re grinding your teeth again.\u201d Sirius complained.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it. Go to sleep.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBetween your gnashing and Prongs\u2019 snoring and Wormtail getting up every five minutes, how can I?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOi!\u201d A voice came from across the room, \u201cI have a nervous bladder!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t drink so much before bed!\u201d Sirius hissed back.\n\n\n\u201cSor-\n\n\nry\n\n\n,\n\n\nmother\n\n\n.\u201d Peter retorted, grumpily, \u201cI didn\u2019t realise you were monitoring my biology.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou trip over your dirty laundry every time you get up!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cActually, it was Moony\u2019s books!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot mine!\u201d Remus called, \u201cFor the prank!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAll of you, shut up!\u201d James yelled.\n\n\nThey were quiet, for a minute.\n\n\n\u201cBloody Wormtail.\u201d Sirius muttered into his pillow, rolling over.\n\n\n\u201cGreat, now I need the loo\u2026\u201d Remus grumbled, getting out of bed, his bare feet hitting the cold floorboards.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t turn the light on in the bathroom, in an attempt to stay semi-asleep, but it was no good. By the time he\u2019d got up, crossed the room, peed and washed his hands, Remus was fully awake. And his jaw hurt, so Sirius must have been right about the grinding. It was for the same reason Peter had been up and down all night, and probably the same reason Sirius couldn\u2019t sleep. NEWTs started next week.\n\n\nAs he exited the little bathroom, Peter rushed forward to go in again, reaching for the panel of light switches on the wall as he did, and hitting the wrong one. Remus winced, feeling as if his retinas had blown out as startling artificial brightness filled the room.\n\n\n\u201cWormtail you prick!\u201d Sirius growled from the bed. Remus had left the curtains part way open, and the light struck across his face like a laser beam.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, sorry!\u201d Peter said, hopping from foot to foot as he fumbled with the switches on the wall, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to get that one\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait until I don\u2019t have to share a room with you any more, you little rodent,\u201d Sirius spat, sitting up, \u201cDon\u2019t you ever think about anyone else?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up, dickhead,\u201d Peter replied, sounding sleepy and upset, \u201cThink I like sharing with you and Moony?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat\n\n\nabout\n\n\nme and Moony?!\u201d Sirius sat up, sharply.\n\n\n\u201cJust go to the loo, Peter,\u201d Remus sighed, flicking on the bathroom light and then flicking off the big overhead bedroom light, so that they were cast into darkness once more. Peter slammed the door and locked it.\n\n\n\u201cSilly little sod\u2026\u201d Sirius grumbled to himself.\n\n\n\u201cSirius!\u201d Remus snapped, in that authoritative voice that always worked, \u201cStop whining.\u201d\n\n\nSirius pressed his lips together, falling instantly quiet, eyes trained on Remus.\n\n\n\u201cGood boy,\u201d Remus smirked. He rubbed the back of his head, glancing at the clock on Peter\u2019s bedside table. Half past three. \u201cI\u2019m going downstairs, I won\u2019t be able to sleep now.\u201d He said. \u201cAnd you can have some peace.\u201d\n\n\nThey\u2019d been sharing Remus\u2019s bed for the past few nights now, and though it was large, it wasn\u2019t really meant for two fully grown boys. Unfortunately they no longer had a choice, since Sirius\u2019s own bed had disappeared earlier that week. They\u2019d been practicing for the prank, and hit a bit of a snag with the main incantation. Sirius remained cheerfully optimistic that it would show up again eventually, but Remus was less sure.\n\n\nHe went quietly down the stairs, book under his arm.\n\n\nRemus loved the common room when it was empty; it was filled with some of his very happiest memories of Hogwarts.\n\n\nHe went over and opened the big bay window. He was always too warm, and forever getting yelled at for opening windows to let cold air in - but no one was around to complain. Remus inhaled the scent of the forest, and the castle; the night sky and the snow from the mountains; the velvety smooth water of the lake and every blade of grass on the quidditch pitch. Hogwarts. He wondered if he would ever feel so at home anywhere ever again.\n\n\nRemus shook his head, realising how silly and sentimental he was being. He left the windows wide and turned back into the room, settling down on the big velvet couch and opening his book. He flicked his wand at the kettle hanging over the fire, and it began to heat up. He flicked through his book at his tea brewed, trying to find his place.\n\n\nWhere would he get his books, after Hogwarts? It was easy enough to join a muggle library - but did wizards have them too? Another question for Sirius - or maybe Chris, when Remus saw him next. Christopher had been very elusive since they\u2019d bumped into each other in Hogsmeade.\n\n\nJust as the kettle boiled, Remus\u2019s ears pricked at the sound of familiar footsteps descending the dormitory staircase. He smiled a secret smile to himself, and without turning around, simply summoned a second teacup from the cabinet, getting ready to pour.\n\n\n\u201cThought you wanted to sleep?\u201d He said, mildly, as Sirius padded across the carpet wrapped in his bed blanket, and sat in the warm spot Remus had left on the couch.\n\n\n\u201cProngs\u2019 snoring still.\u201d Sirius yawned, pulling the blanket tighter as Remus brought over the tea. \u201cBloody hell, it\u2019s freezing down here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll shut the window--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s ok. I\u2019ll warm up.\u201d\n\n\nRemus sat down with his tea, muttering; \u201c\n\n\nLevio liber\n\n\n\u201d, at his book, so that he could read it with his tea in one hand and an arm around Sirius, who leaned sleepily against his shoulder.\n\n\nWill it be like this?\n\n\nRemus wondered,\n\n\nafter Hogwarts? Nights on the couch with no one bothering us.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat you reading?\u201d Sirius asked, watching the heavy book levitating just above Remus\u2019s lap.\n\n\n\u201cOh, something I found on legilimency.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEh?\u201d Sirius raised his head, a small frown forming. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust interested.\u201d Remus replied. \u201cWanted to read something outside of my NEWT core texts, and I thought - mind reading; cool. Who wouldn't want to?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think it ought to be illegal.\u201d Sirius said, suddenly prickly, though Remus didn\u2019t know why. \u201cIt\u2019s an invasion of privacy - practically a dark art.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m only reading about it.\u201d Remus said, carefully.\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean\n\n\nyou\n\n\nwould\u2026\u201d Sirius sighed, settling back down. Seeing it had upset Sirius, Remus allowed the book to set itself down, and stroked his hair, gently, because he always liked it, even if he pretended he didn\u2019t. He felt Sirius relax against him again, before saying in an odd voice; \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to snap. It\u2019s just that my mother can do it. She\u2019s a legilimens.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo she could find out what we were up to - where our \u2018loyalties lay\u2019.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Padfoot.\u201d Remus squeezed his arm. That protective feeling came back, cold and sweet like adrenaline.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be. I\u2019m well shot of her, mad old bat. And I\u2019d sort of learnt to deflect it, by the end. Made her so angry.\u201d He let out a hollow chuckle.\n\n\n\u201cYou learnt occlumency?\u201d Remus raised his eyebrows, \u201cThat's incredible!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot exactly\u2026\u201d Sirius frowned again, but this time Remus knew it was because he was thinking very hard. He sat up, pulling away from Remus, and leaned over to set his tea down on the coffee table,\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more like... you just learn not to think the things she wants you to think. It got worse when we were teenagers, you know, she was worried about \u2018impure thoughts\u2019.\n\n\nTojours pur.\n\n\nSo I\u2019d just\u2026 distract her by thinking something else.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo she wouldn\u2019t find out about Mary?\u201d Remus asked, \u201cOr the other muggle born girls?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUm.\u201d Sirius fidgeted with his hands, looking away, \u201cYeah, that. And\u2026 well, whatever, anything I didn\u2019t want her to know. Trouble is, you end up confusing yourself. It's like tying your own thoughts up in knots. Hard to unpick... \u2018fraid you used to get the raw end of that, a bit.\u201d\n\n\nHe met Remus\u2019s eyes then, and he looked so ashamed and sorry, that Remus realised exactly what he meant. Was that why it had all been so difficult, in the beginning? Why Sirius had been so insistent on pretending nothing was going on between them?\n\n\nRemus put down his own tea and hugged Sirius tightly. He hated her. He hated the war, and he hated himself for not being able to say the right words. This was one of those times it might have really mattered, too.\n\n\n\u201cSirius...\u201d he said, heart pounding as they released each other finally, \u201cI\u2019m so\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt's fine, Moony. It\u2019s over now.\u201d Sirius smiled at him bravely.\n\n\n\u201cI know, but I want you to know, I want to\n\n\ntell\n\n\nyou\u2026 I really really\u2026 I...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Sirius kissed him gently, wrapping his arms around him once more and squeezing him back. \u201cMe too.\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nWell we got no choice\n\n\n\n\nAll the girls and boys\n\n\n\n\nMakin' all that noise\n\n\n\n\n'Cause they found new toys\n\n\n\n\nWell we can't salute ya can't find a flag\n\n\n\n\nIf that don't suit ya that's a drag.\n\n\n\n\nFriday 5th May 1978\n\n\n\n\u201cI failed.\u201d Marlene whispered as they left the exam hall, wringing her hands together.\n\n\n\u201cYou did not.\u201d Mary slung her arm around her friend\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\n\u201cAt least it\u2019s over.\u201d Marlene sighed.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, you\u2019re making me all emotional.\u201d Mary laughed. \u201cHow about you, Lupin?\u201d She reached out to link her arm with his as the three of them walked down the corridor towards the grounds.\n\n\n\u201cAm I emotional?\u201d He asked, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\n\u201cHow do you think you\n\n\ndid\n\n\n?\u201d Mary clarified, \u201cI know you\u2019re stoic.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk, I think. The question on basilisks threw me a bit, but I think I managed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStoic and modest, my dream man.\u201d Mary sighed.\n\n\n\u201cI have to go,\u201d Marlene said, as they turned a corner, \u201cSorry, I said I\u2019d meet--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYasmin.\u201d Mary finished for her, a bit cattily. She let Marlene out from under her arm. \u201cOff you, pop, then.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMoody cow,\u201d Marlene poked her tongue out, \u201cYou know I love you forever.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBack at you,\u201d Mary scrunched up her nose. \u201cSee you at dinner.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBye, Marlene,\u201d Remus said, politely. They were friends again, but it still felt weird.\n\n\n\u201cSee you!\u201d\n\n\nMary kept her grip on Remus\u2019s arm, and looked up at him,\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not about to abandon me for a raven-haired quidditch player too, are you?\u201d She asked, \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s like a club you\u2019re all in.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh shut up,\u201d he laughed, \u201cAnd no. He\u2019s got his Muggle Studies exam.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re mine?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAll yours.\u201d He nodded. She grinned and kissed his cheek. They kept walking, heading for the sunshine.\n\n\n\u201cI think I mucked up the bit on cockatrices,\u201d Mary mused, \u201cI couldn\u2019t ever take them seriously enough to study - I mean for god\u2019s sake, half-dragon, half-chicken?! Fucking nonsense. Still, I reckon I passed ok.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you did,\u201d Remus said, \u201cYou worked hard - we all did.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWorked harder when Ferox was teaching,\u201d Mary grinned.\n\n\n\u201cGod, me too,\u201d Remus replied casually, causing Mary to burst into giggles. He liked shocking her; it was hard to do, most of the time. Mind you, she took everything in her stride. No sooner had they turned the last corner than she stopped in her tracks, a look of distaste crossing her face.\n\n\n\u201cUgh, it\u2019s Rotherhide.\u201d\n\n\nRemus followed her line of vision. They were just at the final archway which led out into the grounds. It was a sunny day, if a little bit cool, and after a rainy start to the year every student not in lessons or exams was out enjoying the weather. Roman Rotherhide, the seventh year Ravenclaw heartthrob, was loitering with a few of his friends just ahead. He and Mary and been on and off for years, and judging by the look on her face, they were most definitely \u2018off\u2019 now.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he done?\u201d Remus asked.\n\n\n\u201cNothing, he just annoys me.\u201d She said. \u201cSome days all of them do.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBoys?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWizards.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFair enough. Come on, let\u2019s just keep walking.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSnog me!\u201d Mary turned to him, \u201cGo on, it\u2019ll drive him mad. Quick, he\u2019s looking!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMary!\u201d Remus laughed, veering away from her, \u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPlease!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUgh, some friend you are,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cCome on, then\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mental.\u201d Remus shook his head, following her. He sighed and slipped his hand in hers. \u201cThere, will that do?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy hero,\u201d she grinned up at him, squeezing his hand back, swinging it back and forth so that Roman was sure to notice.\n\n\nThey settled underneath a large beech tree near the lake. Remus lay on his back with his arms behind his head, watching the boughs creak slowly above, while Mary began to file and paint her fingernails.\n\n\nSirius had made Remus promise not to start revising for anything else once his Care of Magical Creatures exam was finished, and for once Remus didn\u2019t argue. He was right in the sweet spot between full moons where he felt the most healthy and human - plus, lessons were finished forever, which meant he had no homework, and everyone was in a good mood lately - why lock himself away in the library?\n\n\n\u201cGod, I can\u2019t wait for it all to be over.\u201d Mary said, \u201cI\u2019ll miss all of you, obviously, but I\u2019m\n\n\ndone\n\n\nwith school.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re doing after?\u201d Remus asked, closing his eyes and staring at the bright red veins of his eyelids.\n\n\n\u201cMum wants me to do a typing course, get a \u2018proper job\u2019.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou could if you wanted,\u201d Remus mused, \u201cYou could charm a typewriter, easy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHa, I ought to. That\u2019d show mum. Anyway, I\u2019ll probably get myself up the duff and have to get married by the time I\u2019m nineteen, like she did. Then it\u2019s cooking, laundry and church for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat a cheerful thought.\u201d Remus snorted.\n\n\n\u201cLily said you lot were going to help Dumbledore.\u201d Mary said, suddenly.\n\n\nRemus opened his eyes and turned his head, squinting up at her. She was wearing a pair of white framed cat-eye sunglasses, so he couldn\u2019t see her eyes, but her mouth was serious, no longer chirpy.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He said.\n\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 what? You\u2019re all going finish school and go and save the world?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell.\u201d Remus said, steadily, \u201cWe\u2019ll start by winning the war, anyway.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus, please don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\nHe sat up, then, annoyed.\n\n\n\u201cWhy are you bringing this up?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause Lily\u2019s lost all sense of reason since she\u2019s been with Potter. Potter and Black think they\u2019re untouchable anyway and Peter can\u2019t think for himself. You\u2019re the sensible one.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI just\u2026 I think about the attacks at Christmas. Marlene\u2019s brother. The way people are looking at each other these days. I\u2019m frightened. It\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, it is.\u201d He said, his voice hard. \u201cUnless someone stops it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut why does it have to be you? Any of you?! Let Dumbledore fight, if he\u2019s so powerful as everyone says. Why does he need kids to help him?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not\n\n\nkids\n\n\n. Mary, this isn\u2019t about Dumbledore, or even Voldemort, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s about the whole wizarding world. The community; making it a place where we can all--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus, you\u2019re never going to\n\n\nbe\n\n\none of them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLook. Do you know why my family ended up in the UK? My grandad fought in the war. He got medals and all that crap, \u2018the gratitude of the empire\u2019. They said they couldn\u2019t have beat Hitler without the soldiers of the commonwealth. You want to know what happened to that gratitude when the war was over? When he moved here for a better life? \u00a0Do you know what they\n\n\ncalled\n\n\nhim?\u201d She shook her head angrily. \u201cThings don\u2019t change because of stupid heroics.\n\n\nPeople\n\n\ndon\u2019t change. Even if we win the war, even if that creepy Dark Lord bloke is imprisoned, or defeated, or whatever. Potter and Black might get the victory parades, but no one\u2019s going to\u2026 you\u2019re going to be an outsider forever. Look at the way Danny\u2019s been treated.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMary.\u201d Remus said, his tone very cold now. How had they even got into this? They never fought, \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss this any further.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be angry with me.\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019m only trying to--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know. But I\u2019m not interested.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...Remus, I--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we practice some charms? Exam\u2019s in two days.\u201d He stood up, pulling out his wand. Mary remained seated on the grass. She looked up at him, lowering her sunglasses, her brown eyes reproachful. She pursed her lips, then gave a little shrug.\n\n\n\u201cOk. Just let me finish my nails.\u201d"

Oh buggering hell.\n\n\nHow on earth had this happened?! How had he let it get this far?! Remus\u2019s mouth was dry, his palms damp, and the less said about his insides the better. He wished he had Sirius nearby, or even James, to help him calm down. But no one could help him now. He was on his own.\n\n\nMcGonagall turned to him,\n\n\n\u201cReady, Mr Lupin?\u201d\n\n\nHe swallowed, hard, and nodded. Time to bite the bullet.\n\n\n\nFuck\u2019s sake\n\n\n. This was all Christopher\u2019s fault.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThe whole mess had started four days earlier. The marauders were in the library studying for their very last exam; Arithmancy. Well, Peter didn\u2019t take Arithmancy, but he was there anyway; ostensibly for moral support, but mostly to provide sustenance. He\u2019d been a godsend to Remus in particular, making hourly trips down to the kitchens and back with cauldron cakes, pasties, bacon butties and jam tarts.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s half eleven,\u201d Sirius yawned, \u201cC\u2019mon, I don\u2019t think my brain can absorb any more knowledge tonight.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think your brain ever absorbed any---ow!\u201d James winced as Sirius kicked him under the table.\n\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he repeated, \u201cIt\u2019ll be curfew soon, anyway.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re with the head boy, I don\u2019t think curfew matters.\u201d Remus replied, scribbling as fast as his quill would let him.\n\n\nBut James had caught Sirius\u2019s yawn. He removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes, leaning away from the desk.\n\n\n\u201cNah, Padfoot\u2019s right - we\u2019ve been here hours. Let\u2019s call it quits and have a refresher session tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\nPeter was looking at Remus hopefully, clearly bored out of his mind. Remus frowned at all of them.\n\n\n\u201cYou lot go, if you want, but I\u2018ll kick myself if I waste any time on this - it\u2019s our last exam!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re hardly wasting time,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been in the library so much this term they\u2019re considering putting up a plaque in your honour.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s necessary.\u201d Remus said, \u201cI want to beat Snape.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd you will.\u201d Sirius soothed, \u201cCome on, you\u2019re getting black rings under your eyes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Remus sighed, sarcastically, packing away his papers, \u201cMy roguish good looks, ruined\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up, you handsome prick.\u201d Sirius elbowed him lightly.\n\n\nThey gathered the rest of their books, cleaned up the crumbs as best they could, and headed for the library exit. There were still plenty of students studying, all in varying states of distress.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait for it all to be over,\u201d Peter whispered, \u201cImagine! No more homework, forever!\u201d\n\n\nRemus must have looked stricken at this, because Sirius barked with laughter and threw an arm around his shoulders (that was a brotherly gesture, Remus decided, so he permitted it in public).\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll still have deadlines,\u201d James mused, yawning again as they entered the dimly lit castle corridors. \u201cIf you want to do ministry work. Dad complains about them all the time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoubt I\u2019ll ever be as important as your dad,\u201d Peter replied, shoving his hands in his pockets.\n\n\n\u201cHow are the applications going, anyway?\u201d James asked him.\n\n\n\u201cOh. All right. Mum says my step-dad might be able to put in a good word\u2026 you know, in case I don\u2019t hear back from anywhere.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be because of you, Wormy,\u201d James said, \u201cThey\u2019re making cuts everywhere - because of the war. Things are hard all over.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot for quidditch players.\u201d Peter muttered.\n\n\nSirius shook his head disapprovingly, but said nothing.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be a quidditch player,\u201d James said, lightly, \u201cNot until the war\u2019s won.\u201d\n\n\nThe unspoken thing here, Remus thought, was the fact that James didn\u2019t actually need a job, war or no war, talent or no talent. It was the same for Sirius, who was so wealthy he never talked about money at all. Though he didn\u2019t agree with the bitterness, Remus sympathised with Peter on this; the Pettigrews were firmly middle class, and while he would always have a comfortable enough life, he\u2019d be expected to start making money as soon as possible. Whereas Remus, who was barely working class even on a good day--\n\n\nHe was interrupted from his thoughts by an odd noise up ahead, and stopped in his tracks. The others stopped too.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Sirius asked, \u201cForget something?\u201d\n\n\nRemus shook his head, listening. He whispered to his friends,\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s someone around the corner.\u201d He could hear them breathing, but they weren\u2019t moving - neither coming nor going, which was extremely suspicious, given the time of night.\n\n\n\u201cFilch?\u201d James whispered.\n\n\nRemus shook his head,\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s\u2026\u201d he strode ahead, turning the corner, \u201cChris!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, hello\u2026 um\u2026 Remus?\u201d Christopher smiled at him dazedly.\n\n\nHe wasn\u2019t doing anything. he was just standing there, leaning against the wall, staring into space.\n\n\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d the younger boy nodded again, emphatically, \u201cVery well thanks. Very good. Very fine indeed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs he\u2026 stoned?\u201d Sirius \u00a0was already at Remus\u2019s side, and was surveying Chris with thinly disguised amusement.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so\u2026\u201d Remus frowned. He reached out and touched Chris\u2019s arm, gently, speaking slowly, \u201cChristopher? What are you doing? It\u2019s almost curfew, are you on patrol?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPatrol?\u201d Christopher stared at him blankly, before blinking, then nodding again, grinning, \u201cYes! Yes, that must be it!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s confounded.\u201d James said. \u201cChristopher? Has anyone cast a spell on you tonight? Or near you, and it backfired?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe he did it to himself,\u201d Wormtail suggested. \u201cI did that once, remember?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, Chris wouldn\u2019t try to confound someone.\u201d Remus shook his head. \u201cChris, who was the last person you saw?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHm? Oh er\u2026 was it\u2026 you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Remus put his hands on Christopher's shoulders, meeting his eyes and trying to hold his attention, \u201cNo, not me. Concentrate. Before I got here, what were you doing?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWas I patrolling?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I mean\u2026 oh, come on, let\u2019s go back to the tower, eh?\u201d Remus kept his hand on Christopher's shoulder and began gently but firmly steering him up the corridor, throwing anxious looks at the others.\n\n\n\u201cShould we tell someone?\u201d Sirius asked James, \u201cOr\u2026 I dunno, take him to Madam Pomfrey?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not ill!\u201d Christopher piped up, chirpily.\n\n\nJames ran his hands through his hair, shrugging.\n\n\n\u201cI dunno. We\u2019ll ask Lily, she\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d\n\n\nLily did not know what to do. She stood with a hand on her hip and a skeptical look on her face, and asked him a few questions, but was as stumped as the rest of them. He sat before her, quite happily, in an armchair, smiling back up at her. He didn\u2019t seem to mind the interrogation, and while he couldn\u2019t give them any real information, he answered everything with cheerful, blank politeness. Giving up, Lily clicked her tongue.\n\n\n\u201cI mean, he\n\n\nlooks\n\n\nok\u2026 and he doesn\u2019t seem upset\u2026 Christopher? Did you get into a fight with someone? An argument?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Christopher said, thoughtfully, his voice thick and dreamy. He yawned. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go to bed, if that\u2019s alright with you lot.\u201d\n\n\nRemus, James and Lily all looked at each other helplessly. Then Lily turned to James,\n\n\n\u201cTake him up, will you? Just make sure he doesn\u2019t get lost on the way.\u201d\n\n\nJames nodded, happy to be able to take action, and slapped Christopher on the back,\n\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon then, mate, let\u2019s get you to your dorm\u2026\u201d\n\n\nLily, Remus, Sirius and Peter watched them vanish up the staircase.\n\n\n\u201cWeird.\u201d Lily said. \u201cAnd no one else was around?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot that I saw,\u201d Remus said. \u201cBut god knows how long he was standing there.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, he was on the rota for patrol this evening,\u201d she said, pulling out her little leather bound organiser to check. \u201cI always tell the prefects to go round in pairs, though, so he shouldn\u2019t have been alone. He\u2019s usually so reliable. I\u2019ll talk to him in the morning, maybe he\u2019ll be a bit sharper then.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like he came to any harm,\u201d Peter said, offhandedly, flicking through an old copy of Quidditch Weekly, \u201cMaybe he was drunk, or stoned or whatever, and he\u2019s just trying to cover his tracks.\u201d\n\n\nRemus disagreed - it was too wildly out of character. But then, he hadn\u2019t seen much of Chris, lately, they\u2019d both been so busy. He remembered bumping into the younger boy in Hogsmeade a while ago - he\u2019d been acting strangely then, too, but Remus had just assumed he was meeting someone and didn\u2019t want Remus to know who. And if anyone respected other people's privacy, it was Remus.\n\n\nJames returned, saying Chris had seemed fine once he was in his bedroom, and they didn\u2019t talk about it much for the rest of the evening. Just one of those things. In a school full of adolescents learning to use magic, it wasn\u2019t entirely out of the ordinary for accidents to happen.\n\n\nTalk soon turned to the upcoming Gryffindor vs. Slytherin quidditch match; the final match of the year, and the final game of James and Sirius\u2019s school careers. Remus zoned out a bit, letting his three friends work themselves up about it. Secretly he couldn\u2019t wait for it to be done with - as much as it made them all happy, and as much as he wanted Gryffindor to win, it wasn\u2019t half boring to listen to all the time. He picked up his Arithmancy book and returned to his revision, settling into the comfiest armchair.\n\n\n\u201cMoony, c\u2019mon, bedtime.\u201d Sirius woke him, half an hour later. Damn.\n\n\nRemus blinked, blearily, looking down at his textbook. He\u2019d barely got past the first paragraph before falling asleep, his quill still poised between his fingers.\n\n\n\u201cBollocks.\u201d He muttered, closing the book and stretching.\n\n\nSirius chuckled,\n\n\n\u201cTold you that was enough for one day.\u201d\n\n\nRemus just yawned at him, getting up. The common room had cleared out almost completely, now, except for James and Lily, who were \u2018saying goodnight\u2019 on the couch. That usually took a while, so the other three marauders left them to it, climbing the stairs to bed.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThe next morning, Remus was awoken by Sirius - or rather, the absence of Sirius. He was just crawling out of bed, and trying to be sneaky about it.\n\n\n\u201cMmm, stay\u2026\u201d Remus reached for him sleepily, trying to pull him back. His hands ran over the skin of Sirius\u2019s upper arms. Sirius had fantastic skin, it was so smooth, and unblemished everywhere except for the backs of his legs. He kept talking about wanting tattoos, a thought which horrified Remus.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, Moony,\u201d Sirius grinned, gently untangling himself, \u201cBig game in two days, got to practice.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust gone five.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUgh.\u201d Remus flopped back down on the bed, throwing the blankets over his head, \u201cYou\u2019re all mental.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYup.\u201d Sirius laughed, \u201cGo back to sleep, I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\n\n\nHe left carefully, closing the curtains behind him. Remus rolled into the warm hollow Sirius\u2019s body had left behind, inhaled the scent on his pillow, and drifted back to sleep.\n\n\nHe woke up just in time to catch the last of breakfast, and then returned to the library where he met Lily for more Arithmancy study.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so tired of numbers!\u201d Lily groaned rubbing her eyes. They were a few hours in and it would be lunch soon.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss it,\u201d Remus replied, \u201cI like the charts, they\u2019re relaxing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019m just glad there\u2019s nothing like this in potions.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJames said you were looking into a job in an apothecary?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Lily shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d like to do something like that. Maybe research for St Mungo\u2019s. Slughorn offered to write recommendations for me. But things will be complicated for a while I think. James is optimistic, but\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShall we go down for lunch?\u201d She closed her book, brushing her hair over one shoulder, \u201cThe boys\u2019ll be finished soon, we can meet them.\u201d\n\n\nRemus\u2019s stomach growled, and he gave in.\n\n\n\u201cGo on then.\u201d\n\n\nJust as they were getting up to go, the library doors swung open, and Madam Pince screeched, \u201cNo running!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLily! Remus! I need your help!\u201d Christopher came charging up to them so fast his legs hit their desk, banging all the books forward.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?!\u201d Lily asked, her emerald eyes wide.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain, you just need to see\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSee what?\u201d Remus asked, re-ordering his book pile.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 I\u2019ve done something stupid.\n\n\nPlease\n\n\njust come now?\u201d Chris pleaded. His face was red and shiny from running, and while he was definitely looking more alert than he had the evening before, he was clearly genuinely upset by something. So they went.\n\n\nHe led them to the Charms corridor, and the whole way there kept babbling about how it had been an accident, and how he hadn\u2019t meant it to happen. Lily kept trying to get some sense out of him, but he wouldn\u2019t give them so much as a hint.\n\n\nFinally, he stood before the closed Charms classroom door. Professor Flitwick really ought to start locking it, Remus thought to himself, as Christopher faced them, pale and trembling. He fidgeted with the sleeves of his robes, looking down,\n\n\n\u201cOk\u2026 please don\u2019t panic\u2026 it was an accident\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cChristopher, just show us, will you?!\u201d Snapped Lily, tapping her foot on the flagstone floor.\n\n\nChristopher jumped at her authoritative tone, usually reserved for students who were misbehaving, but he took a deep breath and pushed the door open, ushering them in and slamming it shut behind them.\n\n\n\u201cWhat on earth\u2026\u201d Lily breathed, when they saw it.\n\n\nWhat stood before them was an enormous, quivering, glistening blue jelly. It was easily the size of Flitwick\u2019s desk, and just stood there in the middle if the classroom, translucent and wobbling. Remus stifled a laugh. In seven years at Hogwarts this was definitely one of the most ridiculous things he\u2019s ever seen.\n\n\nChristopher hung his head,\n\n\n\u201cHe attacked me, it was self defence!\u201d\n\n\nRemus stopped laughing and looked again,\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a\n\n\nperson\n\n\n?! Chris! What the fuck?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus, language,\u201d Lily elbowed him. \u201cChristopher, who\n\n\nis\n\n\nthat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Roy. Guilderoy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLockhart??\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAm I going to get in trouble?\u201d Chris blinked at them both, his brown eyes huge and frightened.\n\n\n\u201cWhat did you\u2026\n\n\nhow\n\n\ndid you?!\u201d Lily gaped.\n\n\n\u201cIt was a jelly legs jinx. I just expanded on it a bit - Remus taught me!\u201d\n\n\nLily glared at Remus, who held his hands up,\n\n\n\u201cJames taught\n\n\nme\n\n\n! And it never had\n\n\nthat\n\n\nresult.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut why did you do it, Chris?\u201d Lily asked, still staring.\n\n\n\u201cHe was going to confound me again!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWait, what? It was\n\n\nLockhart\n\n\n?\u2019\n\n\nChristopher nodded, shrinking from Lily\u2019s temper. He was embarrassed, Remus could tell. He looked at his feet.\n\n\n\u201cHe did it the other day, but it backfired, I think I tried to dodge it. Maybe he's done it before, I dunno.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe was\u2026 he was worried I was going to tell\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTell what?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe was\u2026 we\u2026 he\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cChristopher, for goodness sake!\u201d Lily folded her arms angrily. Remus felt a stab of sympathy as Chris\u2019s cheeks turned a deeper shade of red.\n\n\n\u201cLook, Lily, it doesn\u2019t matter now, does It?\u201d He said, turning to her to try and shift focus away from Christopher. \u201cWe ought to get Lockhart looked at, first\u2026\u201d\n\n\nHe wasn\u2019t sure how he managed it, but in the end he convinced Lily to go and get Madam Pomfrey, while he and Christopher waited with the jellified Lockhart.\n\n\nOnce she\u2019d gone, Christopher seemed to become even more anxious,\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get expelled!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Remus leaned against the wall casually, pulling out his cigarette case. He offered one to Chris, who shook his head, fidgeting and worrying the cuffs of his sleeves. \u201cJames and Sirius have done worse than this.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never even had a detention before!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSeriously?!\u201d Remus raised his eyebrows as he lit his fag, \u201cWell it's not that bad. You\u2019ll survive. So\u2026 do you want to tell me what's been going on?\u201d\n\n\nChristopher looked at him, his cheeks darkening again.\n\n\n\u201cIt was just\u2026 we just\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing this is who you were meeting in Hogsmeade that time?\u201d Remus prompted, trying to make it easier.\n\n\nChris looked at his feet again and nodded.\n\n\n\u201cOk,\u201d Remus exhaled smoke. He was surprised, obviously, and more than intrigued, but he had to try not to show it if he was going to get any more out if Chris. \u201cSo, you met up a few times?\u201d Another nod, \u201cAnd then\u2026\u201d Remus tried to piece it together, \u201cSomething went wrong? You had a fight?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSort of, I\u2026 um\u2026\u201d\n\n\nGod, this was excruciating.\n\n\n\u201cLook, Chris, I don\u2019t care, ok? He\u2019s a prat who had it coming to him either way, and if you and he\u2026 well it doesn't matter, does it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m stupid, or\u2026 or naive or something. I didn\u2019t even\n\n\nfancy\n\n\nhim that much, I swear, it was just\u2026 just kissing, and I just... you know, he showed an interest, and I thought - well, this might be my only chance.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Remus\u2019s heart went out to him. He touched his shoulder, gripping it in what he hoped was a comforting gesture. \u201cOf course it's not your only chance. People don\u2019t get just\n\n\none\n\n\nchance\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, whatever.\u201d Chris said, looking at the space just over Remus\u2019s shoulder, but deliberately not\n\n\nat\n\n\nRemus. \u201cI suppose it has a lot to do with luck. Anyway, he was a prick. Turned out all he really wanted was to find out about the prank thing. He thought\n\n\nyou\n\n\nand\n\n\nI\n\n\nwere\u2026 he thought I could give him inside information.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell you could,\u201d Remus replied, \u201cYou did half the working out with me, you know more than Sirius knows.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Chris said, \u201cI didn\u2019t tell him anything.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood. Knew you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\nChris smiled at that, and met Remus\u2019s eye properly for the first time.\n\n\n\u201cI told him to keep his nose out. He got annoyed and called me something horrible. Then\n\n\nI\n\n\ngot angry, and I told him I was going to tell everyone what we\u2019d been up to, and he must have panicked.\u201d\n\n\nChris sighed heavily. \u201cI\n\n\nwouldn't\n\n\nhave said anything, I swear. I wouldn\u2019t be that nasty. I was angry, that's all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know mate,\u201d Remus reassured him. \u201cSo he tried to confound you so you wouldn\u2019t tell anyone?\u201d\n\n\nChris nodded.\n\n\n\u201cAll I can think is that I must have tried to deflect it somehow, which weakened it. Probably why I was acting so strangely yesterday.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd this\u2026\u201d Remus gestured at the Lockhart-jelly.\n\n\n\u201cWhen I woke up this morning a bit more if my memory had come back. I realised what he\u2019d done and came to confront him. I\u2026 er\u2026 I lost my temper a bit.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell.\u201d Remus snubbed out his cigarette, \u201cI\u2019m not going to have a go at you for that.\u201d\n\n\nLily was another matter. She returned with Madam Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall. By then, Remus had already decided what he was going to do.\n\n\n\u201cWill one of you boys please explain what happened here?\u201d Their head of year said, her eyes silvery and sharp. Remus was slightly taller than her now, but somehow McGonagall always seemed larger than life, especially when she was about to tell you off.\n\n\n\u201cNo idea.\u201d Remus said, promptly, ignoring Lily\u2019s look of horror behind McGonagall\u2019s shoulder. \u201cChris just found him like this, didn\u2019t you, Chris?\u201d\n\n\nChristopher looked desperately at Remus, then McGonagall, his mouth opening and closing like a fish. Finally he just nodded.\n\n\n\u201cReally, Mr Lupin?\u201d McGonagall raised one dark eyebrow.\n\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d He nodded, hands in his pockets, trying to look casual.\n\n\n\u201cMr Barley simply happened upon Mr Lockhart already in this,\u201d she gestured at the enormous jelly, which Madam Pomfrey was now circling, slowly, muttering under her breath, \u201c...altered state?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d Remus nodded, firmly. He\u2019d have liked another fag, but wasn\u2019t\n\n\nthat\n\n\nbrazen.\n\n\n\u201cThen please explain,\u201d McGonagall\u2019s lips curled at the corners, \u201cHow Mr Barley knew that this was Mr Lockhart at all?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUm.\u201d Remus glanced back at the big blue blob. \u201cWell. Looks like him, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis won\u2019t take long, Minerva,\u201d Madam Pomfrey said, cheerfully, \u201cNo long-term harm done, but he\u2019ll be out of action for a few days.\u201d She began waving her wand and murmuring incantations.\n\n\n\u201cI take attacks on students very seriously, nonetheless,\u201d McGonagall replied. \u201cOne weeks detention, Mr Barley. And as for you, Mr Lupin, as this is your last month at school, I don\u2019t see that detention will be very effective.\u201d\n\n\nThis was not a relief, to Remus. She was still smiling, which meant she knew exactly how best to punish him, and he wasn\u2019t going to like it.\n\n\n\u201cGive me detention if you want!\u201d He said, quickly.\n\n\nMcGonagall chuckled, shaking her head.\n\n\n\u201cNo, I think I have just the thing. With Mr Lockhart out of commission, I believe we have a vacancy for quidditch commentator.\u201d\n\n\nRemus practically felt the colour drain out of his face. The woman was clearly an evil mastermind. Anything but that. Over McGonagall\u2019s shoulder, Lily grinned.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nJames and Sirius thought the whole thing was hilarious, of course, after they\u2019d finished cursing Lockhart\u2019s name. They loved the idea of Remus - who knew about as much about quidditch as he knew about football, or quantum physics - having to commentate their final match.\n\n\n\u201cI just won\u2019t do it.\u201d Remus kept saying. \u201cI\u2019ll just sit there with my mouth shut, there\u2019s nothing they can do.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous!\u201d Sirius nudged him, \u201cYou need to sing our praises!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really just about following the quaffle,\u201d James said, \u201cIf you can keep your eye on that, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOi, spare a thought for the beaters!\u201d Marlene called.\n\n\n\u201cAnd the keeper!\u201d Yasmine added.\n\n\nPeter was less encouraging, and spent the rest of the evening sulking in the corner, brooding over his chess set.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Pete,\u201d Remus tried him, after hours of silent treatment, \u201cI know you\u2019d have liked to do it, but remember this is a punishment for me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have been really good at it, too.\u201d Peter muttered, arms folded tight over his chest. \u201cI know everything about the team, you haven\u2019t even watched any of the practices.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know, you\u2019d have been amazing,\u201d Remus assured him. \u201cWill you help me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHelp?\u201d Peter looked up, cautiously, \u201cHelp how?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGet me up to speed,\u201d Remus encouraged, \u201cGive me\n\n\nyour\n\n\nnotes, for once.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026 yeah, I suppose I could do that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll even ask McGonagall if you can sit with me in the commentator's box,\u201d Remus said, \u201cSo if I balls it up then you can set me right again.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk!\u201d Peter nodded, enthusiastic, now. \u201cYeah, you\u2019ll need to know loads\u2026 I\u2019ll start right now, Moony, I won\u2019t let you down!\u201d\n\n\nIn the end, Peter produced more notes on the 1978 Gryffindor vs. Slytherin Final than he had ever written for any of his lessons. There were reams and reams of parchment with labelled diagrams, lists of players and their numbers, flying formations and a detailed explanation of what seemed to be the quidditch equivalent of the offside rule. He\u2019d even written a little script of phrases Remus could use if he got stuck.\n\n\nSo, even after Remus\u2019s arithmancy exam was over (he was pretty confident he\u2019d done a perfect job on that, it had been a piece of cake), he now had another test to study for.\n\n\nStill, nothing could prepare him for how it felt, now, sitting in a tower high above the pitch, a seat of red and green robed students beneath him, waiting for him to speak.\n\n\nHe felt queasy, and wished he hadn\u2019t eaten such a large breakfast. He\u2019d also had a shot of firewhisky (courtesy of James) and half a joint with Mary before the game started, hoping that might calm his nerves. Unfortunately it seemed to have had the opposite effect, and Sirius\u2019s extremely unhelpful advice to \u2018picture everyone in their underwear\u2019 had got stuck in his head, so now Remus didn\u2019t know where to look.\n\n\n\u201cMr Lupin,\u201d McGonagall said again, \u201cAre you ready?\u201d\n\n\nRemus looked down at Peter\u2019s notes, shuffling them. He swallowed and nodded.\n\n\nPeter had very neat handwriting, nice and round, but Remus\u2019s head was a bit foggy now - the whisky had sharpened him up at first, but that combined with the spliff was making him feel a bit dopey and warm. He pinched the inside of his wrist for some clarity.\n\n\n\u201cMr Lupin,\u201d McGonagall whispered, pushing the microphone towards him. \u201cThe players are on the pitch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh! Sorry!\u201d He blinked, startled, peering down at the grass below and clearing his throat. He read carefully from the parchment in front of him, \u201cHello\u2026 er, I mean\u2026 welcome, everyone, to the Hogwarts Quidditch cup final, 1978\u2026\u201d\n\n\nHis voice sounded weird, echoing out across the oval stadium, but he could hear cheers go up as he spoke, which gave him a bit of courage. He glanced at McGonagall, who smiled and nodded encouragingly. Remus returned his focus to the ground below, and tried to give a bit of commentary.\n\n\n\u201cRight, um. So, here we go\u2026 the teams are on the pitch. That\u2019s Gryffindor in red - Captain James Potter, and Slytherin in green - Captain Kerensa Smythe. Um\u2026 I mean not a lot to say, really, until they\u2019re all up\u2026\u201d He looked down at Peter\u2019s notes again: \u2018\n\n\nintroduce players and their strengths\u2019\n\n\n, \u201cOh ok, so the players\u2026 well obviously James. He\u2019s the chaser\u2026 he\u2019s pretty good, I\u2019m told. I mean, he\u2019s the one who\n\n\ntold\n\n\nme\u2026\u201d\n\n\nA smatter of laughter from the crowd. Remus grinned, then swallowed again and continued.\n\n\n\u201cUm. Gryffindor keeper, Yasmin Patel, also very good, I suppose, I mean as far as I know, I\u2019m no expert\u2026 Sirius Black and Marlene McKinnon, beaters - good beaters\u2026 I mean, the whole team\u2019s really good, let\u2019s just say that.\u201d\n\n\nHe heard Peter groan, sitting behind him, and a titter of laughter from the crowd. McGonagall was giving him a cynical look, but all he could do was shrug helplessly at her and list off the Slytherin players with equal ineptitude.\n\n\n(He did, however, take great pleasure in announcing \u2018Slytherin seeker, Reggie Black,\u2019 - he was sure he saw Regulus\u2019s shoulders cringe at that.)\n\n\n\u201cOh great, looks like they\u2019re about to start,\u201d Remus continued, settling into it now, \u201cYep, there goes the whistle, and - no surprises here - Potter is in possession of the quaffle. Blimey, he\u2019s fast, look at him go! Aaaand it\u2019s a goal! Ten - nil to Gryffindor! Nice one, Prongs!\u201d\n\n\nThe crowd cheered and James zoomed across the pitch, arms raised high in victory. He threw a thumbs up at Remus as he flew past the commentator\u2019s tower, then high-fived Sirius mid-air, before returning his focus to the game.\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t so bad, Remus thought; all he really had to do was watch what happened and then just say it out loud. An idiot could do it.\n\n\n\u201cSlytherin now in possession of the quaffle\u2026 er\u2026 I\n\n\nthink\n\n\nit\u2019s Timothy Bulstrode\u2026 yep, ok\u2026 hm, not as fast as James, is he? Never mind, he\u2019s nearly there - argh! No, blocked by a bludger there from McKinnon, well done Marlene, that looked like it hurt!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMr Lupin, a little less bias, if you please.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry, professor\u2026 ok, so, Potter back in possession, he passes ito to Eriksson\u2026 Eriksson\u2019s really flying, she\u2019s almost --- oh bugger. Slytherin back in possession.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nLanguage\n\n\n, Mr Lupin!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry! Bulstrode heading for the goal posts now\u2026 oh come on, even\n\n\nI\u2019m\n\n\nfaster than that\u2026 he shoots, and --- BLOCKED by Gryffindor keeper Patel! See, told you she was good!\u201d\n\n\nCheers went up from one side of the crowd, boos from another. Yaz did a victory loop, beaming, and Sirius flew past the commentators box, grinning at Remus as he did so. Remus had to admit, quidditch was more exciting that he remembered.\n\n\n\u201cEriksson back in possession of the quaffle now, passes it to Potter, Potter\u2019s charging up the pitch - see, Bulstrode?!\n\n\nThat\u2019s\n\n\nhow you bloody fly---sorry professor--GOAL! Twenty - nil to Gryffindor!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRegulus!\u201d Peter squeaked behind Remus, his finger pointing over Remus\u2019s shoulder at the green-robed younger Black brother, who was now flying very fast indeed, a look of concentration on his face as he zoomed towards an empty square of sky.\n\n\n\u201cLooks like Slytherin seeker Black might have seen the snitch,\u201d Remus said, hurriedly into the microphone, hoping that the Gryffindor seeker was listening. \u201cYep, he\u2019s definitely seen something, he\u2019s speeding up, he\u2019s--- ah, bad luck, blocked by a bludger there from Gryffindor beater, Black.\u201d\n\n\nRemus grinned, and could have sworn Sirius threw him a wink from across the pitch. Regulus, who\u2019d had to brake and dive very suddenly, looked furious, as did the rest of the Slytherin team. Things turned quite nasty after that - both in the game and Remus\u2019s commentary.\n\n\n\u201cEriksson has the quaffle again, is she going to pass to Potter\u2026? No, looks like she\u2019s going to try for a goal herself - COME ON, ERIKSSON! OH FU--I mean,\n\n\nFLIPPING\n\n\nHELL! That was uncalled for! Eriksson hit by a bludger from Avery - Slytherin, and Knott now has possession. Eriksson looks dazed\u2026 is she\u2026 no, that\u2019s a thumbs up, good girl!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMr Lupin, the match, if you please\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight, so Knott has the quaffle\u2026 he shoots\u2026 ten points to Slytherin - but it\u2019s still Gryffindor\u2019s game! Potter has the quaffle, he\u2019s flying\u2026 he\u2019s nearly there, he\u2019s -- SHIT, WATCH OUT, JAMES!\u201d\n\n\nKerensa Smythe, the Slytherin beater was flying at full speed directly into James\u2019s side, and was knocked out of the way in the last few seconds by Marlene, who full-body slammed right into the Slytherin Captain.\n\n\n\u201cBloody hell!\u201d Remus yelled, \u201cNicely done, McKinnon! That girl is brutal - oh, come\n\n\non\n\n\n, Hooch, that\u2019s got to be a penalty to Gryffindor, get off your arse and referee the sodding match! Uh oh, looks like little Reggie Black has his eye on the snitch again...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMr Lupin!\u201d McGonagall snapped again, \u201cI shall take the microphone away.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBe my guest,\u201d he offered, grinning at her. She shook her head, tutting. Remus returned to the game, \u201cSo we\u2019re now - what is it? Oh right, sixty - twenty to Gryffindor - just goes to show that cheating isn\u2019t going to pay off - I hope you\u2019re listening, Black - I mean the\n\n\nyounger\n\n\nBlack, obviously--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Peter hissed behind him. \u201cCalm down! You\u2019re supposed to be giving a balanced-- Oh Merlin!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBuggering\n\n\nChrist\n\n\n, that was close!\u201d Remus yelled, as Regulus and the Gryffindor seeker both reach for the snitch as the same time, only for it to dart tantalisingly out of reach, sending both players careering into the stands, Regulus pulling up just a bit quicker than the Gryffindor seeker, but both of them miraculously staying on their brooms.\n\n\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Peter whispered again, \u201cSlytherin just scored--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey what? they - shit, sorry, folks! Slytherin scored again, must have missed that one\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus apologised to the baying crowd, half of them laughing, the other half now booing\n\n\nhim\n\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t happen again!\u201d He assured them cheerily, \u201cRight, Potter back in pursuit of the quaffle, dodges a bludger from Avery there - jesus, this game is violent - Black - the good one - catches up with the bludger and aims it at\u2026 yes, Regulus Black once again has to dodge. Lucky he\u2019s so used to weaseling his way out of trouble, eh--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDetention, Lupin,\u201d McGonagall was muttering, \u201cYou\u2019ll be in detention for the rest of your school career.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFUCK ME!\u201d Remus yelled into the microphone, as Sirius and Marlene both fired bludgers at the Slytherin beater tailing Regulus, forcing her to swoop so low she almost hit the ground.\n\n\n\u201cCompletely mental!\u201d Remus gaped, \u201cI seriously have no idea why anyone plays this -- ah, but fairplay, it\u2019s distracted Regulus enough to\u2026 wait\u2026 Yes! YES! BLOODY YES! THAT\u2019S GRYFFINDOR WITH THE SNITCH! WE BLOODY WON! OH MY GOD, THANK FUCK FOR THAT, I REALLY--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\n\n\nenough\n\n\n!\u201d McGonagall snatched the microphone from him, finally.\n\n\nHe grinned at her again, too elated with the victory to care much about getting in trouble. Peter was jumping up and down behind him, too, which didn\u2019t help.\n\n\n\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d he started.\n\n\n\u201cI am absolutely shocked,\u201d McGonagall said, sternly. \u201cI expect this kind of behaviour from Black, but I don\u2019t expect it from a former prefect! I expect a letter of apology to the Slytherin team,\n\n\nand\n\n\nto Madam Hooch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, professor.\u201d Remus hung his head and tried to look sorry, but he couldn\u2019t help his lips twitching a bit. he couldn\u2019t wait to see Sirius. He\u2019d run all the way to the changing rooms if his hip (and inhibitions) would let him.\n\n\nFortunately, if there was anything McGonagall loved better than enforcing school rules, it was Gryffindor winning at quidditch.\n\n\n\u201cAfter the celebrations have finished, of course.\u201d She said.\n\n\n\u201cThanks, professor!\u201d Remus looked up, beaming again.\n\n\n\u201cHonestly,\u201d she laughed, shaking her head, \u201cYou\u2019ve never reminded me more of Lyall.\u201d\n\n\nCompliment or insult, Remus didn\u2019t care. For once, even a mention of his father couldn\u2019t touch Remus\u2019s good mood."

            "content": "And as we wind on down the road,\n\n\nOur shadows taller than our souls...\n\n\n\u201cYou could nick it, bet it wouldn\u2019t be hard.\u201d Sirius said, standing beside Remus in front of the trophy case. \u201cJust vanish the glass for a second.\u201d\n\u201cProfessor Flitwick would notice.\u201d Remus raised an eyebrow, distracted now by Sirius\u2019s ghostly reflection in the glass. \u201cOr one of the Ravenclaws.\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d the other boy caught his eye and grinned at him, teeth pearly white, \u201cNo one\u2019ll miss it.\u201d\n\u201cI think,\u201d Remus replied, licking his lips and returning his gaze to the little gold figure on top of the trophy, \u201cLyall would have preferred it to stay put. This way there\u2019s always a piece of him at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\u201cAhh, have you gone all soppy because it\u2019s the last week?\u201d Sirius teased him. Remus smiled, unperturbed,\n\u201cYeah, a bit.\u201d\nSirius chuckled, and leaned towards him confidentially,\n\u201cMe too.\u201d\nRemus pulled a face at him. \u201cCome on then, I\u2019m hungry. Lunch.\u201d\nThey both set off down the corridor towards the Great Hall. Aside from Remus\u2019s streak of detentions following the quidditch final, they\u2019d all had a very relaxing week, with nothing to do but plan for the future. Which of course meant that they had done absolutely no planning for the future.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not leaving anything behind.\u201d Remus said, thoughtfully, as they walked.\n\u201cEh?\u201d Sirius asked, distracted by a group of girls who\u2019d walked past, giggling. Remus flicked his ear. \u201cOw!\u201d Sirius ducked, \u201cThey were looking at\nyou\n, Remus\n\u2018fuck-me-we-won\u2019\nLupin. What were you saying?\u201d\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be leaving anything behind, like Lyall\u2019s trophy.\u201d\n\u201cJames and I are on the quidditch cup. And Prongs is Head Boy, doesn\u2019t that get recorded somewhere? And Peter won that chess tournament.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah. Must just be me, then.\u201d Remus sighed, forlorn.\n\u201cEr\u2026 there\u2019s the whomping willow?\u201d Sirius tried.\nRemus just scowled at him.\nWell\n, he supposed.\nThat\u2019s what you get for trying not to be noticed.\nHe remained contemplative throughout lunch - which was fish and chips, with a choice of mushy or whole peas (Remus experimented with a combination of both).\n\u201cAll right there, Moony?\u201d James asked, between mouthfuls. \u201cYou\u2019re very quiet.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s worrying about his legacy,\u201d Sirius announced. \u201cHe wants a trophy.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, no I don\u2019t.\u201d Remus blushed.\n\u201cIf you ask me, that match commentary deserved a medal. Special services to the school,\u201d Mary laughed. \u201cYou can\u2019t go anywhere in the castle without hearing someone shout \u2018\nbuggering christ, that was close!\n\u2019 It\u2019s brilliant.\u201d\nRemus grinned, feeling a bit better. He\u2019d been quietly enjoying his fifteen minutes of fame, and had received enough gifts of cigarettes and chocolate to see him through the summer. Which was just as well, he supposed, because in a few short months he\u2019d have to start supporting himself.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Remu, if\nyou know what\ngoes off without a hitch on Friday,\u201d James whispered, leaning in, \u201cThen no one\u2019ll forget us in a hurry.\u201d\n\u201cI thought the point was that no one knew who did it?\u201d Remus quirked an eyebrow.\n\u201cOh, come\non\n.\u201d Lily scoffed. And she had a point.\nStill, Remus couldn\u2019t help but be a bit troubled. He didn\u2019t want his only monument to be the whomping willow, or that godforsaken shack.\n\u201cHow do ghosts happen?\u201d He asked, thoughtfully, watching Nearly Headless Nick drift by, chatting with the Fat Friar.\n\u201cMerlin, Moony, cheer the fuck up,\u201d Sirius groaned, mouth full of chips, \u201cYou\u2019d have to be dead to become a ghost. And I s\u2019pose you\u2019d have to die\nhere\n, too, on school grounds.\u201d\nRemus shrugged. Dying at Hogwarts didn\u2019t seem very likely, unless something dire was going to happen in the next few days.\n\u201cA portrait, then.\u201d He said. \u201c...Actually, no. I don\u2019t want to be able to talk to myself, that\u2019s creepy.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re really expensive, too,\u201d James said, \u201cOur family never bothered.\u201d\n\u201cTypical Potters,\u201d Sirius said, haughtily. His plate now clean, he set the knife and fork neatly at its centre, and it soon vanished. \u201cOf course the Blacks are all preserved for posterity in the family gallery.\u201d\n\u201cEven you?\u201d Remus glanced at him,\n\u201cNot me.\u201d Sirius shook his head with a small smile, \u201cI wasn\u2019t there when I came of age. I expect Reggie\u2019s been done now, though. More fool him.\u201d\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Marlene came running up to the dining table. She looked flushed and excited.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Remus sat up straight, looking up at her expectantly.\n\u201cCan I see you for a minute? I\u2019ve got something for you!\u201d She was hopping from foot to foot, clearly very eager to tell him something.\n\u201cEr\u2026 ok\u2026\u201d Remus glanced around nervously. He didn\u2019t like surprises, but he trusted Marlene for now, and she seemed so happy.\n\u201cCome with me,\u201d she grabbed his hand and pulled him up.\n\u201cShould I\u2026?\u201d Sirius started, but Marlene shook her head,\n\u201cIt\u2019s private! Come on, Remus!\u201d She practically dragged him from the hall, apparently not caring that he would miss pudding now.\n\u201cUgh, slow down, will you,\u201d he panted, feeling his hip click as they began to traverse the first flight of stairs.\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019m just so excited to show you!\u201d\n\u201cShow me what?!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s private!\u201d\nHe sighed, and just focussed on trying to keep up with her. Sometimes Remus felt he spent his whole life being dragged around this castle by people who were more athletic than him. When they reached Gryffindor common room Remus looked at her expectantly, and she suddenly turned shy, chewing her thumbnail.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He said, \u201cNot private enough?!\u201d He gestured about the empty room - everyone else was at dinner, probably enjoying their pudding. Hadn\u2019t had apple\u00a0crumble in ages, it would be just Remus\u2019s luck if they were serving it today and he missed out.\n\u201cI think we\u2019d better go up to your dorm.\u201d Marlene said, setting off again. \u201cJust in case.\u201d\n\u201cJesus Christ, Marls, what\u2019s this all about?\u201d Remus followed her up the stairs,\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ve suddenly decided I fancy blokes, so I\u2019ve lured you up here to seduce you,\u201d she casually threw over her shoulder.\n\u201cYou spend too much time with Mary.\u201d He returned dryly.\nOnce they were in the bedroom, she closed the door, and Remus went to sit on his bed, his legs sore. She looked around furtively,\n\u201cWhy are there only three beds in here?\u201d\n\u201cAcceptance testing for the prank went a bit wrong.\u201d Remus shrugged.\nMarlene just shook her head like an overindulgent mother. She reached into the pocket of her robes and pulled out a small shallow jar, and held it out to Remus.\n\u201cTrousers off,\u201d she said.\n\u201cExcuse me?!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s for your hip!\u201d She unscrewed the jar excitedly, her eyes bright and eager, \u201cI made it for you, and Danny tested it and everything!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what does it do?\u201d He peered into the pot warily. Whatever was inside looked like vaseline, semi-transparent with a thick, goopy consistency.\n\u201cI thought about what you said about how a mixture of muggle and magical medicine works best,\u201d she explained, \u201cSo I did some experimenting. I tried valerian and comfrey and turmeric\u2026 turned out that ginger worked the best, who would have thought? Then just combined it with the right amount of anti-inflammatory poultice, and some dittany for extra strength. Go on! Rub it on!\u201d\n\u201cEr. Ok\u2026\u201d Remus said, taking the jar and walking into the bathroom, locking the door behind him. He held it in his hands for a while, sniffing the contents. It smelt like ginger, which was fairly pleasant, and not too strong.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t need too much,\u201d Marlene called through the door, making him jump and retreat as far into the bathroom as he could. \u201cJust smooth it onto the skin over the sore area.\u201d\n\u201cOk,\u201d he replied, croakily. This was weird. But he owed to it Marlene to try, if this was a peace offering.\nHe unbuckled his trousers and pulled them down to his thigh, underwear and all. Then, balancing the jar carefully on the side of the bath, he scooped out a small dollop of the concoction - about the size of a grape - with his fingers, and carefully rubbed it onto his bare skin.\nIt was tingly at first, and then began to grow warm - but not unpleasantly so. He could feel it seeping into his skin, down into the joins and gristle and bone, warming and soothing as it went. It was a feeling he\u2019d long forgotten. It was relief.\n\u201cMarlene!\u201d He shouted.\n\u201cWhat?! Are you ok?!\u201d She called anxiously.\n\u201cIf you still want to seduce me,\u201d he replied, \u201cI\u2019d probably do anything you asked me to right now.\u201d\nHe heard her sniggering on the other side of the door,\n\u201cIt works, then?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bloody miracle!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s bloody magic, you silly git,\u201d she replied. \u201cCome out, then!\u201d\nHe hurriedly pulled his trousers back up and fastened them, striding over to the door and opening it. Not so much as a twinge.\nHis hip had bothered him for so long now he could barely remember what it felt like to walk without being conscious of his limitations. He beamed at Marlene, grabbed her around the waist and spun her around.\n\u201cThank you!\u201d He said, over and over.\nShe squealed,\n\u201cLupin you lunatic, let me go!\u201d\nHe kissed her on the cheek and put her down.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lot stronger than you look,\u201d she laughed, blushing, tucking her hair back behind her ear, \u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad it worked! I wanted to ask Madam Pomfrey to help so many times, but I thought you\u2019d rather I kept it to myself.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said again. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re amazing! I wish I had some way to pay you back!\u201d\n\u201cYou have,\u201d she shook her head, \u201cYou helped Danny, even though you\u2019ve never met him, and you knew how dangerous it was. And\u2026 you helped me, in the end, too. I know what I want to do now. We\u2019re going to win this war, and when it\u2019s over I\u2019m going to start doing some proper research into lycanthropy, you know, set up\nreal\nclinics so people get the help they need. If everyone else can see what I see in you and my brother, then maybe\u2026 I dunno, maybe things can be better.\u201d\nShe was looking at her feet bashfully as she said this, but Remus couldn\u2019t stop grinning, shifting from foot to foot just to prove to himself it didn\u2019t hurt.\nNothing hurt\n. He had to tell Sirius.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be an incredible healer, Marls,\u201d he hugged her again. \u201cCan I keep this?\u201d He went back to the bathroom for the jar, holding it up.\n\u201cOf course you can!\u201d She nodded vigorously, \u201cI don\u2019t know how long the effects last\u2026 if you wouldn\u2019t mind making a note of it, each time you reapply? It\u2019ll be useful to know\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, anything,\u201d he replied, carefully screwing the cap back on.\n\u201cI\u2019d better go and find Yaz - she\u2019s got no idea where I\u2019ve been all day, I told her it was to do with the prank, but I don\u2019t think she believes me...\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re down in the common room, the lot of them, they just got back from dinner,\u201d Remus replied offhandedly, still staring at the jar in awe.\n\u201cHow on earth could you know that?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026\u201d he glanced up, awkwardly\u2026 \u201cGood sense of smell\u2026 like\nreally\ngood.\u201d\nHer eyes widened, and she shook her head solemnly,\n\u201cI\u2019ve got so much to learn\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he laughed, patting her shoulder, \u201cOne thing at a time\u2026\u201d\n* * *\nSirius was a true gentleman when Remus told him the good news about Marlene\u2019s poultice, and did not say \u2018I told you so\u2019 even once. He was too happy listening to Remus babble about how much better he felt.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I ever did.\u201d Remus sighed after they\u2019d gone to bed later that night.\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d Sirius yawned.\n\u201cYou know. You learnt\nlenticular magna\nfor me, all the way back in first year. And Lily made me that reading aid, and you, Peter and Prongs all became animagi, just so you could spend time with me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I did,\u201d Remus replied, shrugging, \u201cTo earn any of it.\u201d\n\u201cMoony,\u201d Sirius gave him a funny look. \u201cYou\u2019re doing that thing again.\u201d\n\u201cEh?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re your friends! Friends help each other! As if you haven\u2019t done things for Lily, and Marlene, and Wormtail, and James, and me\u2026 merlin,\nme\nmore than anyone.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Remus replied, still smiling, \u201cI know. I suppose I just feel so lucky.\u201d\n\u201cYou\nare\nsoppy these days,\u201d Sirius smirked, folding his arms behind his head. \u201cIs this what it\u2019s going to be like living with you? And I always thought you were such a tough nut.\u201d\n\u201cStill tougher than you.\u201d Remus glanced at him sideways.\nSirius\u2019s eyes were closed, but he was smiling. Now seemed as good a time as any.\n\u201cDo you really want to live with me?\u201d Remus asked.\n\u201c\u2018Course I do,\u201d Sirius replied, eyes still closed.\n\u201cI mean\u2026 not just with James\u2019s parents. In our own place.\u201d\nSirius opened his eyes,\n\u201cObviously. That\u2019s the plan, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Remus fumbled for the right words. He was very comfortable around Sirius now, feeling he could say almost anything. But sometimes it was the same old struggle. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure. You know I haven\u2019t got much money\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd you know I\u2019m rolling in it,\u201d Sirius shrugged, making the bedsheets crinkle. \u201cWhat\u2019s mine is yours, I don\u2019t want you worrying about boring crap like that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s only boring to you because you\u2019ve never had to think about it.\u201d\n\u201cWell now you don\u2019t have to think about it either. Got it?\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d Remus nodded. Something to revisit later, maybe, when there wasn\u2019t a war looming, and they could have conversations about normal, everyday things. For now, if they weren\u2019t talking about the war, Sirius preferred daydreams. Remus settled back, \u201cWhere shall we live, then?\u201d\n\u201cLondon.\u201d Sirius said, firmly. \u201cMuggle London.\u201d\n\u201cIn a big house?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sirius shook his head, frowning a bit, \u201cI don\u2019t like big houses; too many empty rooms. If it\u2019s just two of us, we don\u2019t need all that space.\u201d\nThis was a remarkably sensible consideration, but Remus didn\u2019t say anything. He understood. But if they were being sensible\u2026\n\u201cI want you to meet Hope.\u201d He said. Sirius opened his eyes again,\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s dying,\u201d Remus said, matter of factly, \u201cLung cancer - a thing muggles get. Anyway, it can\u2019t be cured, and I don\u2019t think she has more than a year.\u201d\n\u201cMoony, I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I had no idea.\u201d\n\u201cS\u2019ok,\u201d Remus replied, \u201cI\u2019ve known since the first time I met her. I\u2019ve known I wouldn\u2019t have long. She\u2019s not perfect, but she cares about me. I want her to see that I have someone. That I\u2019m not alone.\u201d\n\u201cMoony\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Remus laughed, \u201cI\u2019m being soppy\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sirius reached over and laid his hand softly on Remus\u2019s chest. \u201cThat\u2019s just one of the nicest things I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\nRemus turned his head too, and they looked at each other for a bit, both smiling in the shadowy darkness of the quiet night. When his eyes began to prick, Remus laughed again, looking away,\n\u201cChrist,\u201d he said, \u201cListen to us, we\u2019re worse than Potter and Evans.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone!\u201d Sirius laughed, wiping his eyes quickly. \u201cOnly three days of school left, we\u2019ve got reputations to maintain.\u201d"

It would begin any moment.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of me, ok?\u201d Christopher whispered, looking down at the grounds from the high open windows, \u201cBut this is the most exciting thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\nRemus smiled at him fondly, and gave his hand a quick squeeze.\n\u201cI bet you this is just the beginning. You\u2019re going to do so many exciting things, I know it.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, it\u2019s going to be quiet with you lot gone,\u201d Chris replied, peering down at the lawn below them, \u201cI bet they make Regulus head boy\u2026 ooh! That\u2019s the signal!\u201d\nA fountain of golden sparks shot up from behind the greenhouses, and Remus could hear Christopher\u2019s heart begin to beat faster with the excitement.\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it, then!\u201d Remus elbowed him.\nThey both turned to look at the owls, hundreds of them perched in rows lining the tower walls, all the way up into the rafters. Beside them was a pile of letters - all blank except for the address. And they all had the same address.\nChris looked like he was ready to burst with the thrill of it all, and Remus stepped back, giving him the floor,\n\u201cYou know the spell, you do it.\u201d\n\u201cReally?!\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus grinned, \u201cPlenty of mischief to go around after this\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOk!\u201d He rolled up his sleeves, licking his lips. He uttered the incantation and swept his wand broadly around the tower. A low hoot, a ruffling of feathers, and then\u2026 utter chaos as all five hundred owls suddenly leapt from their perches and swooped down towards the two boys, who both ducked for cover.\nRemus had never seen anything so magnificent; every single owl in Hogwarts spread its wings and soared out of the window, each one snatching a blank addressed letter as it passed. It must have taken two full minutes for them all to manage it, and when it was over, Remus and Christopher jumped at the window to watch them disappear down towards the courtyard, through the arches and on to their destination.\n\u201cWow!\u201d Chris kept saying, like a yappy little dog, \u201cWow wow wow!\u201d\nRemus just grinned, and thought about James and Sirius elsewhere in the castle, watching for that signal. And Mary, Marlene and Yaz, poised and ready for their own part, and everyone else in the castle waiting, waiting for the thing they had been planning since Christmas.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Remus said, grabbing Chris\u2019s arm, \u201cWe can watch them all running out.\u201d\nIf five hundred owls suddenly flocking to the dungeons didn\u2019t get everyone out, then Remus was confident that James and Sirius\u2019s patented exploding toilet seats would do the job.\nThey ran down the spiral staircase together (Remus taking the steps two at a time, still relishing his newfound mobility) and onto the main corridor, where pandemonium reigned supreme.\nEvery portrait was singing at the top of its lungs - from muggle pop songs to wizard nursery rhymes, whatever the third years had fancied when they cast the spell, Remus assumed. The suits of armour had left their posts and taken to following students around. Remus hoped that wasn\u2019t too menacing - they weren\u2019t actually\ndoing\nanything, after all, just mimicking movements. It had been James\u2019s idea - king of locomotion spells.\n\u201cI did it, Remus, I did it!\u201d A fourth year Ravenclaw came running out of the nearest bathroom, followed by a mass of pink bubbles, \u201cBlew it right up!\u201d\n\u201cWell done!\u201d Remus clapped him on the back, congratulating him.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait for the big finish!\u201d\n\u201cBetter hurry,\u201d Remus advised, \u201cWon\u2019t be long.\u201d\nThe fourth year nodded and set off towards the grounds, pink foam flooding out into the hall.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve taught so many people things they never would have learnt,\u201d Christopher marvelled as they walked. The big clock outside the Great hall was whirling madly, hands spinning - so was every other clock, if the sixth years\u2019 spell had worked correctly.\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Remus snorted, \u201cBlowing up toilets and levitating desks. Very useful.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget all the defensive stuff,\u201d Christopher frowned, \u201cI\u2019d have been confounded again if not for you.\u201d\nThey followed the steady stream of students exiting the building. Remus just hoped they\u2019d caused enough mayhem in enough areas of the castle to get everyone outside onto the lawn. It wouldn\u2019t be any fun if half the school missed the main event.\n\u201cHow is Lockhart?\u201d He asked, casually.\n\u201cFine, I think. Leaving me alone, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cGood. S\u2019pose you can handle him if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d They\u2019d reached the courtyard now, and were within sight of the grounds. Christopher squinted in the bright summer sunshine and looked up at Remus, stopping a moment. \u201cI\u2019ll really miss you, though.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re only here one more year,\u201d Remus replied, \u201cYou\u2019ll be too busy with NEWTs to think about anything else; trust me.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m still going to miss you.\u201d Chris said, firmly. \u201cI\u2019ll keep the study group going - but it won\u2019t be the same. Everyone likes you so much, you\u2019re patient with them.\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t know how to respond to that, so he didn\u2019t. There was a funny lump in his throat, all the same.\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he pulled Christopher\u2019s arm, moving towards the grounds. \u201cDon\u2019t want to miss it!\u201d\nMore than half the school had gathered on Hogwarts\u2019 expansive lawn, all chattering a mile a minute about the various interruptions and intrusions to their mornings.\n\u201cDid you see all those owls?\u201d\n\u201cThe Great Hall is flooded!\nFlooded\n!\u201d\n\u201cThe Ravenclaw door-knocker is speaking gobbledygook, apparently, won\u2019t let anyone in.\u201d\n\u201cThe statue of the knight on the fifth floor threw water balloons at me!\u201d\n\u201cMarauders, do you reckon?\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely.\u201d\n\u201cNo! I saw Emmeline Vance casting a spell on the portraits - and a group of sixth years planting dung bombs. It can\u2019t be the marauders.\u201d\n\u201cWell it can\u2019t be\neveryone--\n\u201d\nThe conjecture was interrupted as the last of the Slytherins - Regulus, Barty Crouch, Mulciber and Snape, much to Remus\u2019s satisfaction - emerged from the castle. They were all plastered in green slime. Lily\u2019s surprise bogey-bombs had worked a treat. Remus made a mental note to congratulate her later. She\u2019d be a marauder, yet.\n\u201cYou!\u201d Snape came charging over, globs of pea green ooze dripping from his hair, from the tip of his nose. He pointed a long finger at Remus, face contorted with rage. \u201cYou did this! You and your filthy little friends!\u201d\n\u201cWhatever\u2019s the matter, Snivellus?\u201d Remus asked, coolly, holding his ground, \u201cYou don\u2019t look any different to me.\u201d\n\u201cYou! You!\u201d Snape spluttered, laughter erupting around him as younger students gathered to see.\n\u201cScourgify,\u201d Regulus cast a cleaning charm on himself, restoring his clothes and hair to their usual impeccable neatness. He gave Snape a bored look, \u201cHave some decorum, Severus. Don\u2019t rise to their pathetic bait.\u201d\n\u201cHey Prongs, look, they got Snivellus!\u201d Sirius appeared through the crowd, grinning, followed by James, and Peter, \u201cExcellent!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good look, if you want my opinion,\u201d James smirked, patting Remus on the shoulder by way of greeting.\nAt the sight of Sirius, Regulus rolled his eyes and walked away, joining a group of Slytherins near the edge of the lake, huddled together muttering between themselves like a murder of crows.\n\u201cWhen Dumbledore finds out you\u2019re all behind this, he\u2019ll--\u201d Snape raged.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sirius cocked an eyebrow, leaning on James\u2019s shoulder casually, as though they were just chatting, \u201cExpel us? On the last day of school?!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll pay!\u201d Snape snarled. He turned and began to stalk back to the school, his robes still dripping.\n\u201cSlow down, Snivelly!\u201d Peter called out, hardly able to contain his excitement, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to miss the grand finale!\u201d\n\u201cWormtail!\u201d Sirius hissed, kicking his shin. \u201cShh!\u201d\n\u201cCome on, it\u2019s nearly time,\u201d Remus said, trying to draw them all away from Snape. He was obviously about to lose it, and Remus didn\u2019t trust the others not to push him over the edge.\nWorryingly, they ended up quite close to Regulus and his clique, by the lake - but it was getting crowded and there weren\u2019t many places to stand. Remus had never been one for public displays of affection, but he really wished he could hold Sirius\u2019s hand right then, if only to stop him doing anything stupid.\nNo such luck.\n\u201cReggie-boy,\u201d Sirius nodded at his brother pleasantly, eyes glittering with mischief.\n\u201cSirius.\u201d Regulus replied, facing forward, head held high. He was like an alabaster statue; a cold marble version of his hot-blooded sibling. \u201cI had hoped you\u2019d learnt to put these childish games behind you.\u201d Regulus drawled, sounding bored as ever. \u201cSilly pranks and schemes won\u2019t be any use to you once the war is won. The Dark Lord demands order.\u201d\n\u201cSod your stupid old dark lord,\u201d Sirius tutted, folding his arms. Remus realised the two brothers were mirroring each other\u2019s body language.\nAll around the lake, students were gathering; they were seconds away. Remus took the opportunity to glance about at the most familiar faces - there was Christopher, talking animatedly to a few of his sixth year friends, no double re-telling what he had done in the owlery. Marlene, Mary and Yaz were giggling between themselves, and a bit further along was Emmeline Vance, still a perfect ice maiden, flirting with poor old Roman Rotherhide. A gaggle of younger students from the study group were practicing the incantation they were about to perform, and beside Remus, Lily and James were holding hands, wands at the ready.\nWith a great clang, the Hogwarts clock tower struck midday, and James gave off a loud whistle, commanding everyone\u2019s attention. It was now!\nIt seemed to Remus that they were all holding their breath for a few beats, and he gripped his own wand tighter, throwing a quick grin at Sirius, before turning his attention back to the lake - and what lay beneath.\nAll working as one, the members of The Marauders\u2019 Inter-House Pranking Collective raised their wands and gathered their strength, shouting; \u201c\nAttollo Magna\n!\u201d\nRemus\u2019s knees weakened. They\u2019d tested the a few times, just the four of them in their bedroom (hence Sirius\u2019s vanishing bed), but never with so many others - never so much magic at once. He felt as though he\u2019d stuck his wand arm into a beehive; the magic began to thrum and vibrate through him, filling his mouth and nostrils like battery acid and pooling deep inside. Power. He was giddy with it; practically drunk. He shook his head doggishly, trying to maintain his focus and hold on - he had no idea what would happen if he let go.\nMeanwhile, something was happening on the lake. The surface began to ripple and shimmer; an odd groaning creaking sound came from a mile below, and then\u2026 then\u2026 *POP*. With almost comical immediacy, the spell had worked. Remus felt a great twist inside himself - which was not unpleasant, but not ignorable either, causing him to gasp.\nThey\u2019d done it. Students began to laugh and point, the Slytherins were crying out, one by one, stupid with shock. Even Regulus\u2019s mouth had dropped open.\nThere, hovering just meters above the still waters, directly over the dungeons, hovered every bed and trunk from the Slytherin dormitories. It was beautiful. Absolutely perfect in every way. The layout of each dorm had been preserved; all they\u2019d had to do was transport everything a mile or so upwards. The barrier charm (soft-hearted Lily\u2019s idea) was working well too - meaning that no one's possessions were really in any danger of getting wet. They\u2019d just have to work out the counter-spell, and everything would return to normal - provided all of the Slytherins worked together, of course.\nThat had been a Hufflepuff idea.\nRemus\u2019s muscles were still twitching from channelling all that magic. He was a live wire; static buzzed at his fingertips. Luckily, very few people noticed; they were too busy cheering or screaming with dismay at the sight before them. Fireworks were flying over the tops of the beds now, spelling out;\n\nHave a Great Summer, Slytherin! From; Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff!\n\n\u201cAre you ok, Moony?\u201d Sirius looked at him, reaching an arm out.\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d Remus snapped, stepping back and shrugging Sirius off, hurriedly. He didn\u2019t know what would happen; but he didn\u2019t feel at all safe to be around.\nSirius rubbed his own arm, looking hurt.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Remus breathed, shaking his head again, \u201cJust give me a minute--\u201d\n\u201cYOU!\u201d Oh no. Severus had re-appeared, and was charging towards the marauders, wand raised, red faced. It looked like he\u2019d got off most of the slime.\n\u201cThieves!\u201d He hissed, glaring at James and Sirius, \u201cGive me my things back! Get them down at ONCE!\u201d\nSirius and James were beside themselves with laughter, which didn\u2019t help matters, but Snape really had brought this on himself. No one\nelse\nwas ranting and raving like a lunatic.\nLily tried to intervene, breaking away from James.\n\u201cSeverus, it\u2019s not what you think, it\u2019s easy enough to--\u201d\nBut it was too late. Snape had already turned to the lake and aimed his wand at whichever bed was his. He was trying a basic levitation spell; but it wasn\u2019t going to work - the marauders had designed the spell\nspecifically\nto ward against that kind of measure.\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t!\u201d Lily yelled, covering her eyes.\nBut of course Snape never listened; not when he felt he\u2019d been wronged. It seemed to work for a moment; one of the beds jerked a bit, and wobbled. But only for a microsecond. The next thing anyone knew, it had come loose, plummeting into the sparkling waters below with a loud splash.\nSeverus stared; his mean mouth a hard straight line, dark greasy hair falling into his eyes.\nHe turned, wand raised, and Remus caught a scent - a scent he had only recognised twice before; like charred flesh. Dark magic. A curse. Another twist in his gut, this time far less pleasant, and Remus felt a change inside him.\n\u201c\nSectumsempra\n!\u201d Snape cried.\nRemus didn\u2019t even need his wand; he had more than enough power, and without thinking, stepped in front of James, raising his hand as Severus flung the curse.\nThe world seemed to take on a strange red hue, and wind roared in Remus\u2019s ears, so that he only very faintly heard Lily\u2019s scream, and James and Sirius shout, \u201cMoony!\u201d\nThe curse hit Remus - but he felt nothing. It seemed to simply dissipate as soon as it touched his skin, leaving him with nothing worse than a feeling of mild sunburn. Still; he was weaker now than he had been two minutes ago. As if the force of the barrier he\u2019d created had sapped him of all of his other magic.\nHe blinked, and everything came back to normal. Snape was still standing in front of him, looking terrified and furious in equal measure. Sirius\u2019s hand was on Remus\u2019s arm, and James was now charging towards Snape.\nRemus sank slowly to the grass below, exhausted. He sat cross-legged on the ground, dazed, Sirius crouched beside him,\n\u201cMoony?!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m ok.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck was that?!\u201d Sirius whispered, urgently. He sounded scared.\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d Remus whispered back, bowing his head.\n\u201cIt was just a counter-jinx!\u201d Lily suddenly shouted, and Remus realised she was addressing the students that had gathered around, curious. Always quick on her feet, that girl, \u201cSnape tried to curse Potter, you all saw it! Lupin just caught it in time.\u201d\n\u201cCan you get up?\u201d Sirius was asking, tugging at his elbow. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to Madam Pomfrey--\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Remus shook his head, fiercely, getting up, \u201cI\u2019m ok. Honestly. Just surprised myself. Wordless magic or something, I haven\u2019t got the hang of it yet.\u201d\n\u201cOk\u2026\u201d Sirius was looking at him warily. Lily was on crowd control, and James seemed to have chased Snape away - or else he\u2019d gone to Slughorn to formally complain about the prank.\nEquilibrium restored itself. Remus gave Sirius his best smile, and gave his arm a gentle squeeze to show that it was all ok now. Sirius relaxed a bit, nodding.\nThe older Slytherins a bit further along the lake edge were now conferring amongst themselves. It seemed that Snape\u2019s misfortune had benefited his house-mates. At least now they knew what wouldn\u2019t work.\n\u201cSort of nice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Mary sauntered over, smiling broadly and completely oblivious to what had just happened. \u201cSee them all employing a bit of teamwork. We might have house unity yet!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t count on it,\u201d Marlene smirked, just behind her.\nThe Slytherins had begun to argue loudly.\nThey all stayed to watch the drama unfold a while longer. One particularly hilarious attempt to restore order resulted in every second bed lifting a few feet higher. Another spell caused them all to face west, for no discernable reason. After an hour had past, a group of Ravenclaws took an interest and began workshopping more ideas with the desperate Slytherins.\nAt that point, Remus was feeling normal again, which meant only one thing.\n\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d He announced.\n\u201cFeast\u2019ll be in half an hour,\u201d Lily said, distracted by the squid, who was playing with one of the Slytherin's bedside tables, trying to bat it with its longest tentacle.\n\u201cI might go up and get changed then.\u201d Mary said.\nEveryone agreed. Leave the Slytherins to it.\nAs they walked back up to the castle, grinning and laughing together, Remus was aware of Sirius\u2019s eyes still on him, but still couldn\u2019t offer any explanation. Whatever had happened had only ever occurred once before - that afternoon in the forest with Castor and Livia. And that was hardly a pleasant memory for either him\nor\nSirius.\n\u201cOi, Black,\u201d Marlene said, appearing beside them, \u201cEver get your bed back?\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d Sirius frowned, \u201cOh, no, I never did. Long gone now, I s\u2019pose, seeking its fortune on the open road. Godspeed, old bed.\u201d He sighed, wistfully.\nRemus sniggered.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you worried the school\u2019ll charge you for it?\u201d Marlene said.\nHe shrugged. Marlene tutted,\n\u201cSpoilt brat.\u201d\n\u201cDid you even\ntry\nto get it back?\u201d Lily asked.\n\u201cWell, we don\u2019t know where it went.\u201d James replied, chuckling at the memory.\n\u201cNot even a basic summoning charm?\u201d\n\u201cNo, we never--\u201d\n\u201c\nAccio bed\n!\u201d Sirius yelled at the top of his lungs, waving his wand.\nA faint and distant rumble.\n\u201cOh shit\u2026\u201d Sirius murmured.\nThe lake behind them began to bubble, and they all turned in time to see Sirius\u2019s four poster bed rising from the water like a great mahogany submarine. Draped in seaweed and heavy waterlogged velvet hangings, it rose into the air and flew towards them so that they had to scatter and dive to the ground, covering the heads. It crashed on the spot Sirius had summoned it to with a heavy, squelchy THUD, and promptly splintered into several pieces.\nSilence for a few seconds, as Lily, Marlene, Mary, Yaz, James, Peter, Remus and Sirius raised their heads once more, climbing to their feet in amazement. Then laughter from every quarter - especially the Slytherins still gathered by the lake\u2019s edge.\nSirius just stood there, scratching his head.\n\u201cHm.\u201d He said. \u201cBottom of the lake all along, eh?\u201d\nIt was still dripping. The sheets were green with algae and sand and grit piled up on the mattress.\n\u201cOi, you wanker!\u201d James said, approaching the rescued bed and snatching up a rectangular pile of greyish mulch, \u201cIs this my quidditch magazine?!\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 maybe\u2026\u201d Sirius grinned - then, catching the murderous glint in James\u2019s eye, began to run at full pelt back to the castle, James chasing after him.\n\u201cI suppose now\u2019s as good a time as any,\u201d Peter whispered to Remus, \u201cBut, er\u2026 Filch caught me with the map earlier. He confiscated it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Remus rounded on him, angry. That map was\nhis\n! His idea, his magic!\n\u201cDon\u2019t be angry with me, Moony!\u201d Peter cringed, \u201cIt was locked and everything, I promise! No one can get into it unless they\u2019re up to no good --\nand\nthey\u2019d have to break into Filch\u2019s office!\u201d\nRemus stopped at these words. He was right about that. After all; anyone who could achieve both those feats would certainly be worthy of the map. And he had wanted to leave something behind; a true legacy. This way, perhaps Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot & Prongs might be remembered, one day.\nHe squinted ahead at the two dark haired boys chasing each other and whooping with laughter. He looked at the four girls, who\u2019d all linked arms and were walking cheerfully back to the castle, voices light and carefree.\nWhat did Remus Lupin have to be angry about? What had he to worry about? His heart swelled, and he was reminded of something Sirius had told him a few months ago. Love was something you\ndid\n, not something you said; and every one of these people had proved that to him.\n\u201cAlright, Wormy,\u201d Remus flung his arm around Peter\u2019s shoulders, grinning, \u201cYou\u2019re forgiven. C\u2019mon, let\u2019s catch up.\u201d"

He was wearing very dark sunglasses and looked paler than normal. \u201cAnd stop all the banging, will you?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTake another painkilling draught,\u201d Remus tutted, \u201cYou\u2019re just hungover, it\u2019s your own fault for getting so smashed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was the life and soul, I\u2019ll have you know.\u201d Sirius retorted, folding his arms as Remus came to sit beside him.\n\n\nThe Potters had hosted the end of school party the night before, for all Hogwarts leavers and their friends. Yaz and Chris had come, even though they both had another year to go. A few members of the Order of the Phoenix were there too - no Dumbledore, but Ferox and Moody and Frank Longbottom and his pretty blonde girlfriend (now fiance, apparently). Moody had called Remus over to them a few times, only to be intercepted by Mrs Potter.\n\n\n\u201cIt's his school leavers party, Alastor!\u201d She hissed, after the fourth time. \u201cLet him enjoy himself for five minutes before forming a flipping war council!\u201d\n\n\nShe said this so sharply that they desisted - Remus was a bit shocked too. That was the closest he\u2019d ever heard Mrs Potter come to swearing.\n\n\nThe rest of the party had felt just like the Gryffindor common room - while at the same time feeling\n\n\nnothing\n\n\nlike the Gryffindor common room. Remus tried not to be so sad. He tried to imagine that one day he would find somewhere else that felt as much like home as Hogwarts had.\n\n\nLily, Mary and Marlene all had to leave at midnight - they\u2019d promised their parents they\u2019d spend the night at Lily\u2019s. Apparently their families felt that after seven years of boarding school, enough was enough.\n\n\nWhich brought Remus back the the present, watching James through the phone box door, talking to his girlfriend. Who he had literally said goodbye to eight hours earlier.\n\n\n\u201cSo unfair, him making us race down here - as if I could ever beat James \u2018hangover free since \u201873\u2019 Potter.\u201d Remus grumbled. \u201c\n\n\nAnd\n\n\nit was unsportsmanlike. He knows I have a handicap.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI thought your hip was better since you got that stuff off Marls?\u201d Sirius frowned, making his sunglasses slip down his nose.\n\n\n\u201cIt is.\u201d Remus replied. \u201cI meant my smoking.\u201d\n\n\nThere was a low rumble somewhere in the distance. Sirius sat up, suddenly, ripping off his glasses.\n\n\n\u201cIs that?!\u201d\n\n\nRemus sighed.\n\n\n\u201cSounds like it, yeah\u2026\u201d\n\n\nIn a few moments, the neighbour\u2019s motorbike came streaking through the village, growling all the way. Sirius gazed after it, starstruck. Once it was nothing but a shiny chrome dot in the distance, he leaned back, smiling to himself.\n\n\n\u201cAh, I\u2019ve missed her.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt would be a \u2018she\u2019.\u201d Remus muttered, folding his arms.\n\n\n\u201cPotter!\u201d Sirius now got up to thump on the phone box door, \u201cGet out here right now!\u201d He turned to Remus, \u201cWill you cheer the fuck up after you\u2019ve had your phonecall?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Remus said, petulantly, looking at his feet.\n\n\nIt was another five minutes of \u2018goodbyes\u2019 and \u2018speak soons\u2019 before Remus got his chance. He dialed the number eagerly, and coiled the plastic cord around his fingers as he listened to it ring.\n\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs that how you answer the phone?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHiya!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCrikey! Wasn\u2019t expecting you, did we set something up?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d Remus shook his head, grinning madly, \u201cI finished school - I can call whenever I like now!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBrilliant!\u201d\n\n\nHe heard some rustling on the other end of the phone and assumed Grant was making himself comfortable. Good. Sirius and James could wait a good long time. \u201cSo when you coming down to see me, eh?\u201d Grant was asking now.\n\n\n\u201cSoon!\u201d Remus said, automatically. He could apparate to Brighton in a matter of seconds, now the thought struck him. But that would be a tough one to explain. \u201cNext week?\u201d\n\n\nThat would hit the sweet spot between full moons, at least.\n\n\n\u201cWorking Saturday,\u201d Grant replied. \u201cOn lates at the pub. Saving up for a holiday\u2026 er\u2026 August?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh. Um. Well, ok,\u201d Remus said, a bit disheartened.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, just I\u2019ve been waiting for a proper summer holiday ages, and I\u2019m getting on a plane and everything\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, no, August is fine!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood, I\u2019ll remember to get some milk in. So where you living now?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAt my friend James\u2019s. His parents are really nice.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot moved in with lover boy, then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s here too.\u201d Remus explained, knowing it sounded a bit weird. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start looking for somewhere to live soon, though. London, hopefully.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe rich, then?\u201d Grant snorted, \u201cShoulda\u2019 guessed that. Looks well-heeled, don\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI s\u2019pose.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe does. Got that good posture. Oi, let me tell you about this bloke I had round the other night\u2026\u201d Grant said, and began a very long and almost unbelievable story about an encounter he\u2019d had with a fisherman (\u201ca genuine, honest to jesus fisherman, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d) who\u2019d done something very odd in Grant\u2019s bathtub before making a hasty exit in the early hours of the morning. By the end of it, Remus was hunched over in the phone box, wheezing with laughter, tears streaming down his cheeks.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?!\u201d James and Sirius were keen to know, when he finally emerged.\n\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t possibly tell you,\u201d Remus replied, hiccupping, \u201cMuggle humour.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReckon we ought to see how Pete\u2019s doing?\u201d James asked as they walked back to the house.\n\n\n\u201cNah, you know how he is with hangovers,\u201d Sirius replied, dark shades still firmly in place.\n\n\n\u201cAll right, but we need to make sure not to leave him out,\u201d James said, opening the garden gate, \u201cI think he\u2019s worried about it\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Sirius yawned. \u201cOi, quidditch?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d James grinned, \u201cJust let me change\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get a book, then\u2026\u201d Remus rolled his eyes, though he didn\u2019t mind really. They were going to treat the weekend as a holiday, it had been decided. Real life could start on Monday.\n\n\nThe three boys thundered up the stairs, James slamming his bedroom door as he went in search of one of his many quidditch kits.\n\n\nRemus and Sirius were a little slower,\n\n\n\u201cBrighton in August?\u201d Remus asked quietly, now they were alone. Sirius\u2019s face lit up, and he took off his glasses,\n\n\n\u201cYou want me to come, then? Yeah! Cool!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Remus nodded, reaching the top of the stairs.\n\n\n\u201cHello, boys,\u201d Mrs Potter trilled, coming out of Remus\u2019s room. He did a double take at that - he wasn\u2019t used to adults going into his bedroom uninvited, even though it wasn\u2019t really\n\n\nhis\n\n\nroom, only a guest room.\n\n\n\u201cHello, Mrs Potter,\u201d he replied, politely, hoping to mask his unease.\n\n\nShe was carrying a pile of his laundry, which was horribly embarrassing - at St Edmund\u2019s he\u2019d been doing his own washing since he was ten.\n\n\n\u201cI see Sirius was so drunk he ended up in yours, Remus,\u201d Mrs Potter laughed, folding Sirius\u2019s jeans over her arm. \u201cHonestly dear, you ought to have just shoved him out.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Remus felt his ears turning bright red as he gaped at her from the landing.\n\n\n\u201cActually,\u201d Sirius came up the stairs after him, \u201cRemus and I prefer sharing. If that's\u2026 er. Well we\u2019d just prefer to, ok?\u201d\n\n\nMrs Potter looked at him, then at Remus, who was still blushing, but managed to splutter,\n\n\n\u201cYeah!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, if you like,\u201d she nodded, slowly. \u201cI suppose the bed\u2019s big enough for two. Whatever makes you happy, dears.\u201d She patted Remus gently on the shoulder, and kissed Sirius\u2019s cheek as she passed him on her way downstairs.\n\n\nAnd that was pretty much that.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nWednesday 5th July 1978\n\n\nThey were permitted a longer holiday than expected - two days longer, in fact. The invitations came late Tuesday night; a note each from Dumbledore, requesting their presence at a secret location known only to James\u2019s father, reachable only by portkey. The notes vanished as soon as they\u2019d been read, simply dissolved away in their hands.\n\n\nThey\u2019d all been expecting something like it, but Remus was surprised how nervous he suddenly grew. He was not the only one. He and Sirius undressed for bed in silence, and as soon as they were under the covers Sirius was clinging to him, face buried under Remus\u2019s arm.\n\n\n\u201cTell me something.\u201d He mumbled, thickly, \u201cAnything.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really scared about tomorrow.\u201d Remus whispered. \u201cIt feels so real now. But I think it\u2019s normal to be scared. I think anyone would be.\u201d\n\n\nSirius just made a discontented sort of grunt. Remus squeezed him and tried a different tack. \u201cBut d\u2019you know what scares me more?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re planning to move in together and neither of us can cook.\u201d\n\n\nSirius began to laugh, and eventually they must have both fallen asleep properly. When they woke up they were still wound around each other, sweat had gathered where their bare skin pressed together, and Remus had big wide red patches all over until he\u2019d showered.\n\n\nIt was a bit of a walk to the portkey, which turned out to be a bright yellow rubber duck, left in some long grass at the end of one of the fields surrounding the village. Remus didn\u2019t mind, he liked stretching his legs now it didn\u2019t hurt so much.\n\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe we\u2019re only a few miles from London,\u201d he marvelled, looking up at the cloudless summer sky, the rolling green hillsides.\n\n\n\u201cGarden of England,\u201d James grinned.\n\n\nFleamont solemnly held out the duck for them all to put their hands on.\n\n\n\u201cAll got your wands?\u201d He asked, sharply, and they each nodded, swallowing hard. Peter was sweating and looked faintly ill - Remus hoped he wouldn\u2019t throw up until they\u2019d arrived wherever they were going.\n\n\nThey all touched the duck, and suddenly found themselves whirling through space and time at an incredible rate. It was worse than apparating, but better than floo powder, Remus decided.\n\n\nMoments later, all five men landed in a very small, chintzy living room. The carpet was thick, soft pink, the sofas an ugly yellowish cream fake leather, and the wallpaper a hideous floral design with metallic streaks that caught the light.\n\n\n\u201cFleamont?\u201d A tall, thin, red haired man entered just as they were picking themselves up.\n\n\nRemus had only narrowly missed landing on the glass coffee table, which was adorned with a bowl of soapy smelling potpourri.\n\n\n\u201cArthur!\u201d James\u2019s father replied, cheerfully, reaching out to shake the man\u2019s hand.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, Monty,\u201d Arthur raised a finger, \u201cBut Moody would never forgive me if I didn\u2019t follow protocol. Now, let me see\u2026 what was the nature of the last owl I sent you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was a thank you card,\u201d Mr Potter replied promptly, \u201cEffie sent Molly a few of James\u2019s old things for Bill and Charlie.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLovely.\u201d Arthur smiled and finally returned Mr Potter\u2019s handshake.\n\n\n\u201cBoys, you remember Arthur Weasley,\u201d Fleamont said, ushering them all forward to shake the man\u2019s hand too. \u201cThis is my boy James, Sirius, Peter Pettigrew and Remus Lupin.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHello there, what\u2019s this?\u201d Arthur was looking at the duck portkey, which Remus was still clutching.\n\n\n\u201cEr. A rubber duck.\u201d Remus replied, looking down at it.\n\n\n\u201cI see, I see, and what\u2019s it for?\u201d Arthur advanced on him, peering down at the yellow plastic toy with earnest curiosity.\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 it\u2019s just a rubber duck,\u201d Remus shrugged. \u201cD\u2019you want it?\u201d He held it out. Arthur beamed at him, taking it.\n\n\n\u201cBetter not tell Molly! She thinks I\u2019m mad already.\u201d\n\n\nRemus smiled, politely, privately thinking that Molly must be right.\n\n\n\u201cHow is Molly?\u201d Fleamont asked, \u201cAnd the boys? Twins, did I hear?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, three months old now,\u201d Arthur nodded happily, \u201cI did wonder if we ought to stop at five, but Molly\u2019s keen to try for a girl; poor thing\u2019s rather outnumbered, as things are.\u201d\n\n\nAs he spoke, he led them out of the hyper-feminine living room, down a narrow hall and into a tiny kitchen, which had a conservatory built onto the back. Frank and Alice were in the kitchen, lining up a queue of mugs on the counter.\n\n\n\u201cHello!\u201d Alice smiled, \u201cTea?\u201d\n\n\nShe took everyone\u2019s orders, while Frank divied up tea leaves in various teapots, and they were all told to go through to the conservatory for the meeting.\n\n\n\u201cWhose house is this, dad?\u201d James asked.\n\n\n\u201cBest we don\u2019t know too much,\u201d Mr Potter replied, \u201cCome on, now, they\u2019ll all be waiting.\u201d\n\n\nAfter the shadowy gloom of the narrow 1930s kitchen, the conservatory was blindingly bright and extremely warm. It had a clean terracotta tile floor, covered over with a homespun rag rug. The surrounding windows were glass and displayed an immaculately kept garden which had a double swing set and a slide; the roof was clear perspex and smattered with old dead leaves leftover from winter. There was a strong smell of fertiliser and geranium, potted plants were dotted about the place on shelves and end tables.\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t notice any of these things at first, because the room was packed full of people. There must have been twenty or thirty witches and wizards, gathered solemnly around a large wooden table, or else standing, or crammed into the wicker garden furniture in the corner. Hagrid loomed largest - Remus had never seen Hagrid anywhere but Hogwarts, which was so big that it sort of compensated for the gamekeeper\u2019s gargantuan proportions. In this hot little sun room he barely seemed real.\n\n\nThere were other recognisable faces; the Prewett twins, Mad-eye Moody, Professor Ferox, Ted Tonks, Emmeline Vance and Dorcas Meadowes - no Dumbledore, but to Remus\u2019s delight, Lily, Mary and Marlene were huddled in one corner, looking awfully young and shy in such a crowd. They greeted the boys with an eager kind of relief. Mary clung to Remus\u2019s neck very tightly.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d He said, surprised.\n\n\n\u201cI never was that bright,\u201d she smiled ruefully.\n\n\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Marlene reached for him, \u201cThis is Danny!\u201d\n\n\nA tall man stood just behind her. He had Marlene\u2019s smile; her ruddy cheeks and straw coloured hair.\n\n\n\u201cOh, hello,\u201d Remus nodded, suddenly shy himself. Sirius took a sideways step closer, so that they were shoulder to shoulder,\n\n\n\u201cHi!\u201d Danny said, grinning. He had a fresh scar creeping up from under the collar of his robes, but nothing on his face; not yet. He extended a hand for Remus to shake, \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting you, I owe you such a--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDanny McKinnon!\u201d James suddenly burst out. Having finally greeted Lily sufficiently, he\u2019d only just caught sight of this awkward meeting. He strode forward, \u201cCan I just say that you are absolutely, without a doubt, the\n\n\nbest\n\n\nBeater the Cannons have ever had?!\u201d\n\n\nDanny laughed amiably,\n\n\n\u201cThanks. I hear you\u2019re a bloody good Chaser - it\n\n\nis\n\n\nJames Potter?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, and I\u2019d love to--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHate to break up the social club, gents,\u201d Moody barked, \u201cBut we\u2019ve some business to get down to.\u201d\n\n\nThat shut everyone up, and they gathered around the table looking very serious. They began with a few introductions, though one way or another most people knew each other. When Sirius\u2019s name was spoken there was a bit of hushed murmuring, but he just stared defiantly back at them all. Remus was proud of him - let them all see that you could never judge a book by its cover, or a man by his name.\n\n\nAfter that, someone read minutes from the last meeting - Remus didn\u2019t understand any of it. They all seemed to talk in a strange, grown up sort of code, and no one stopped to explain things like they did at school. Lots of names were mentioned; people in different corners of the country who were on their side - or who had gone over to the other side. Various policies being pushed through the Wizengamot, ways to influence votes; how to convince people to come around to the Order\u2019s way of thinking.\n\n\nRemus dared glance over at Sirius, James and Peter, and was relieved to see that they were just as puzzled as he was. Then the list of missing was read, and everyone followed that all right. Alice proposed a minute\u2019s silence, which they all observed.\n\n\nThere were some more updates - everyone wanted to know what Dumbledore was up to, what progress he had made. Progress with what, exactly, Remus had no clue. Assignments were also handed out - Frank and Alice needed to be in Anglesey every night next week at 6pm exactly. A man called Shacklebolt had to meet \u2018our mutual friend\u2019 \u2018you know where\u2019 on Friday. The Prewett twins were on the rota for guarding this location or that. Everyone nodded along as Moody singled them out.\n\n\nFinally, Moody called an end to the discussion.\n\n\n\u201cThose who have to go, go,\u201d he said, gruffly, \u201cI\u2019ll send word via the usual channels for our next meeting. Anyone needs to speak to me now, you\u2019ll have to wait a bit.\u201d He clambered to his feet, hands on the table.\n\n\nSuddenly, the little conservatory was no longer silent and solemn, as everyone began chattering with the person next to them, furtively agreeing things, or else just catching up. Remus blinked. That was it?! He frowned, and looked for Mr Potter, who was pushing his way around the room to them,\n\n\n\u201cCome with me and Hagrid,\u201d he said to their group, \u201cYou too, ladies, we\u2019ll get you all up to speed, eh?\u201d\n\n\nRemus relaxed, finally. Thank goodness for that. It was deeply unpleasant, feeling so out of the loop. He felt incredibly young and naive.\n\n\n\u201cNot you, lad,\u201d Alastor Moody had reached them too, and clapped a chapped calloused hand on Remus\u2019s shoulder. \u201cFerox and I need a word. And you, McKinnon - Daniel, that is.\u201d He added, to answer Marlene\u2019s startled expression.\n\n\nRemus\u2019s eyes widened and he silently pleaded to Sirius for help, only for Ferox to join them all, laughing,\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look so jumpy, Lupin, I promise we\u2019re not going to torture you.\u201d\n\n\nRemus laughed weakly, accepting his fate. He and Danny followed Moody and Ferox out of the conservatory back into the house; through the poky kitchen and along the corridor, up the brown carpeted staircase, which creaked heavily underfoot.\n\n\nThey entered a small box room, evidently a child's bedroom. There was a small bed in the corner with a stars and spaceships pattern on the duvet. The furniture was small and painted pale blue, and there were glow in the dark stars on the ceiling.\n\n\n\u201cSit down, chaps,\u201d Ferox nodded at the little bed. Danny and Remus obeyed. Moody stood. Towering over them both, his electric blue eyeball whirring in its socket.\n\n\n\u201cNo prizes for guessing what we want to talk about.\u201d He said.\n\n\nRemus said nothing, because he didn\u2019t think an answer was required, but Danny did.\n\n\n\u201cThe werewolves.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Ferox said, sitting in a small desk chair, leaning forward on his knees.\n\n\nHe was as handsome as he had ever been, in Remus\u2019s opinion. Still a broad, amiable \u2018man of action\u2019. His golden blond mane of hair was as lustrous as when Remus was fourteen, only maybe with some grey streaks now. An old, comfortable warmth bubbled in the pit of Remus\u2019s stomach - a crush he had never even recognised at the time, which felt so innocent now. He smiled, finally, feeling a bit more at ease.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how I can help,\u201d Danny was saying, \u201cI never met one until that night.\u201d He shuddered slightly.\n\n\n\u201cBut Lupin here has,\u201d Moody said, fixing both eyes on Remus.\n\n\n\u201cYou have?\u201d Danny\u2019s eyes flicked over Remus, taking him all in with surprise.\n\n\nRemus knew what Danny saw, obviously; it was what everyone saw, a skinny, gawky eighteen year old with a too long neck and scrubby blond curls and knobbly knees and so many scars. He swallowed, feeling like a stupid kid in a room full of men.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I have.\u201d He said, looking at his hands. \u201cTwo members of Greyback\u2019s pack, Livia and Castor.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGreyback?!\u201d Danny said in hushed awe. \u201cBloody hell.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus isn\u2019t new to this sort of operation.\u201d Ferox said. He sounded proud, but Remus looked up at him, beseeching, because yes he\n\n\nwas\n\n\n, he was absolutely new to all of this - spying and secret meetings and warfare. He didn\u2019t like this feeling. Everyone was expecting a lot.\n\n\n\u201cI just talked to them.\u201d He said. \u201cThey don\u2019t hurt me because Greyback told them not to, I think. They do everything he says, they\u2019re loyal.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLike an army.\u201d Ferox said, nodding, as if he understood. Remus gave him a long stare.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cLike a family.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a dangerous cult.\u201d Moody said, sharply. \u201cI don\u2019t care what we call it. We need to keep an eye on them. Insight.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo what do you want us to do?\u201d Remus asked, straightening his back. He felt more himself. Ferox was still looking at him, but with real respect now.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, what can we do?\u201d Danny asked.\n\n\nMoody\u2019s haggard, pitted face curved into a wicked grin.\n\n\n\u201cEver heard of Knockturn Alley?\u201d"

Well; he actually apparated a lot of the way, but caught the tube two stops just to make it look convincing. Moody had forbidden him from using the Potters\u2019 floo connection in case he was followed, and Remus agreed.\n\n\nHe entered the alley via the brick wall by the Leaky Cauldron, and headed straight for the pub. Danny was inside, waiting for him, nursing a tumbler of firewhisky. He smiled sheepishly at Remus,\n\n\n\u201cNeeded some dutch courage.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cKnow the feeling.\u201d Remus nodded, grimly. He ordered the same from the hunchbacked innkeeper.\n\n\nThey moved away from the bar and found a quiet corner. Remus cast\n\n\nmuffliato\n\n\nfor good measure. They exchanged pleasantries, briefly - Marlene had begun training at St Mungo\u2019s and was enjoying it, Danny wasn\u2019t doing much of anything.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got savings, obviously; I\u2019m not exactly hard up,\u201d he sighed, \u201cThe Cannons paid pretty well, I could retire if I wanted. Just didn\u2019t expect to this early.\u201d\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t know what to say, because the idea of having a job at all still seemed too distant for him. The older man kept stealing glances at Remus\u2019s scars, too. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, when he was caught staring, \u201cI just\u2026 you know. Never seen\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Remus replied, trying to relax a bit. He swallowed the last of his whisky and pulled out his cigarette case. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Do you have\u2026?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOnly one or two.\u201d Danny replied. \u201cS\u2019pose I\u2019ll get more. Oh, and the bite, obviously.\u201d His eyes darted around as he said this, in case anyone was listening in.\n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Remus nodded, lighting his cigarette and inhaling desperately. \u201cDo you know who did it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it matter?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt might,\u201d Remus shrugged, \u201cI think it\u2019s important to them, anyway. I think the one who turns you\u2026 they have a connection to you, afterwards. You might recognise their scent. They might recognise yours.\u201d\n\n\nDanny wrinkled up his nose in disgust.\n\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you learn all this stuff?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSome of it\u2019s just experience. Some of it from books. Have you read anything?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Danny looked away, \u201cNever been one for reading. At St Mungo\u2019s they said not to bother, anyway. Not like there\u2019s a cure.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Remus frowned, somehow bothered by this line of reasoning, \u201cNo, there\u2019s not a cure, but\u2026 well there are still things to learn. It\u2019s not just a disease, you know, it\u2019s who we are.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cS\u2019not who I am.\u201d Danny said, fiercely, his fist clenched on the table.\n\n\nRemus looked away too, embarrassed. Danny wasn\u2019t ready for this, he realised. He was still in denial. Danny raised an arm, signalling to Tom at the bar for another drink. Remus wondered how many he\u2019d had already. It seemed rude to ask; Danny was older than him, had been in the Order longer.\n\n\n\u201cSo.\u201d Danny said, business like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan? Go in, ask questions?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so\u2026\u201d Remus said, carefully. God, Danny definitely wasn\u2019t ready. \u00a0\u201cI think we need to be more\u2026 um\u2026 subtle.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe want them to know who we are.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll know who we are the second we walk in. The scent.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUgh.\u201d Danny wrinkled his nose again and downed his next drink.\n\n\n\u201cLook, why don\u2019t you stay here?\u201d Remus tried, \u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve done this sort of thing before, I\u2019ll be fine. I can send you a signal, if I get into trouble.\u201d\n\n\nDanny shook his head.\n\n\n\u201cPromised Ferox and Moody I\u2019d do it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t know, I won\u2019t tell them.\u201d Remus pressed, \u201cReally, it\u2019s fine, if you\u2019re not comfortable, they shouldn\u2019t make you---\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI said I can do it!\u201d Danny slammed his fist down on the tabletop.\n\n\nRemus had a strange desire to start growling. It would be so much easier to settle this as wolves; he could just assert himself as the leader, and Danny would have to submit or get a cuff round the ear. He settled for just meeting Danny\u2019s eye and holding it, sternly. It had the desired effect.\n\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d The quidditch player said, sighing, tense shoulders now sloping down, wearily. \u201cI\u2019m just wound up, with the moon coming on Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI understand.\u201d Remus said, evenly. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to keep it together in there, ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah. Ok.\u201d Danny nodded. He paused, giving Remus an appraising look, \u201cMarls said you were the cleverest kid in the year.\u201d\n\n\nRemus felt his ears turn red.\n\n\n\u201cHardly,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\u201cShe trusts you, though. I think I\u2019d better too.\u201d Danny had submitted. Remus straightened his back, a flush of animal pride running through him.\n\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he nodded. \u201cOk, so they\u2019ll know us when we go in. The scent - I know you don\u2019t like it, but I swear, it\u2019s one of the most useful skills you have now, so don\u2019t ignore it, all right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s confusing, though.\u201d Danny said, sounding frustrated, \u201cHalf the time I don\u2019t know what it is I can\u2026 smell.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Remus asked, \u201cCould you identify me?\u201d\n\n\nDanny looked at him, quietly, concentrating. His nostrils twitched slightly. He nodded.\n\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d Remus said, a bit excited now - he\u2019d never had anyone else to talk to about this before, \u201cIt\u2019s like\u2026 like something familiar, isn\u2019t it? Something you know really well. You\u2019ll get better an distinguishing different scents, as long as you stop trying to ignore it. I find that if I relax it\u2019s much easier - hardly any work at all, really, it just comes naturally after a while.\u201d \u00a0Then he remembered something else that Danny ought to know, though he wasn\u2019t sure how to phrase it. \u201cUhm\u2026 You might notice that um\u2026 females smell different too. Er. More attractive.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Danny nodded again, paling a bit.\n\n\nRemus looked down, cleared his throat, and resumed.\n\n\n\u201cAnd the ones I\u2019ve met? The ones in Greyback\u2019s pack? They\u2019re strong. They have really powerful magic, they don\u2019t even need wands all the time. So it\u2019s best not to make a move, because it won\u2019t be like duelling - they\u2019re hard to predict.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMerlin.\u201d Danny breathed.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Remus said, briskly, \u201cThey won\u2019t try to fight us. I don\u2019t think they will, anyway. It wouldn\u2019t make sense; they want to recruit us.\u201d\n\n\nDanny snorted derisively.\n\n\n\u201cFat chance.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTry to be understanding, though.\u201d Remus said, \u201cListen to them - we want them to think we\u2019re interested, right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight. Of course. Except we\u2019re not.\u201d Danny was looking at him oddly again.\n\n\n\u201cObviously not.\u201d Remus snapped. \u201cBut we\u2019re still there to make friends. We\u2019re there to talk, which means first we have to listen.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the impression I had from Moody.\u201d Danny said, \u201cThis is reconnaissance, not a peace mission.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell Moody doesn\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d Remus said, \u201cDanny, listen to me. Stop thinking they\u2019re your enemies, because they\u2019re not. The one who bit you - he was wrong, ok? He ought to be arrested, he ought to be punished. But someone bit\n\n\nhim\n\n\n, once. And because of that, his whole life changed, and no one looked at him like he was the same person any more. You understand that, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\nDanny was staring at the bottom of his empty glass. He didn\u2019t answer, but Remus knew he was paying attention.\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like us.\u201d Remus said, firmly. \u201cExcept they\u2019ve not been as lucky. You and me, we have people who care about us, who want to keep us safe, who know we\u2019re more than just\u2026 just monsters. The ones we\u2019re about to meet, maybe they never had that. Maybe Greyback was the first person who cared.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nPerson\n\n\n.\u201d Danny spat, \u201cHow can you talk like that. How can you give a toss about what happens to them? How can you be so\n\n\ncalm?!\n\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been angry for long enough.\u201d Remus replied coolly. \u201cNow I\u2019m ready to do something about it.\u201d\n\n\nThey ordered one more drink, and then they left.\n\n\nDanny said he had never been to Knockturn Alley before, and of course Remus only knew it by sight - and scent. The odour of dark magic was still there; acrid smoke, sour milk. It was a dim, cobbled street with crooked lanes winding off in different directions. The shop windows were dingy and displayed diabolical assortments of dark and dangerous artefacts.\n\n\nThe pub was easy to find. The Manticore\u2019s Head had a horrible swinging sign hanging on a bracket outside which bore the image of a manticore\u2019s bloody severed head on a platter. The creature had the head of a man, but a thick lion\u2019s mane. Its eyes rolled upwards and its mouth gaped in a silent moan of misery. It made Remus shudder. It looked like Ferox.\n\n\nHe went in first, Danny more happy to follow than lead. He pushed the door open and the moment he crossed the threshold he caught the scent. It hit him like a wall, igniting him, making every hair stand deliciously on end.\n\n\nFive werewolves. He knew each one before he laid eyes on them. Three gathered around a table in the far corner. Two at the bar. There were others there too; creatures Remus had heard of, but never seen. A vampire. Two banshees. A whole gang of goblins.\n\n\nDanny was tense behind him, Remus willed him to calm down; it was so obvious. But there was nothing they could do now but go in; Remus heard the door bang shut behind them.\n\n\nIt was fairly dark inside; the windows covered with threadbare velvet curtains. The mahogany wall panelling and countertops were grimy, covered in a strange sticky dust that glistened in places like glitter. Behind the bar were enormous mirrors covered with shelves and shelves of bottles, each one a different size, shape and colour, glowing in the firelight like a wall of jewels. The fire roared, but it was strangely cool.\n\n\nRemus approached the bar, as casually as he could manage. The figure standing behind it was heavily robed, hood pulled low, so that Remus couldn\u2019t see its face.\n\n\n\u201cTwo firewhiskies, please.\u201d He said, instantly regretting the politeness. He\u2019d spent too much time at the bloody Potters\u2019.\n\n\nThe bartender turned around, and reached for a bottle. Remus fumbled in his robes for change. Danny joined him, standing close, looking around himself furtively.\n\n\nThe two werewolves at the bar were watching them both. That was to be expected, of course; that was what they wanted. All part of Moody\u2019s plan - Remus and Danny were invaluable to the Order, he said. A boy who\u2019d been turned by Greyback himself; who Greyback was interested in, and a man who\u2019d been recently turned, who the others would see as vulnerable.\n\n\nRemus nodded at them, carefully. Danny didn\u2019t move a muscle, but that was ok - it was clear that Remus was the leader. The other two nodded in return. Remus sensed curiosity, but not danger. He straightened up, more confident.\n\n\nThey were male, both roughly the same height, only an inch or so shorter than Remus. One was stocky, with dirty blond hair, a square jaw, fairly handsome under any other circumstances. The other was one of Greyback\u2019s. His hair was shaved close to his skull, he had a thick scar on one cheek, and of course the tattoos covering his arms and throat, spiralling moon phases.\n\n\nGlancing over these two men\u2019s shoulders, Remus tried to get a read on the three in the corner. Two of them were female, one male, all Greyback\u2019s. No Livia or Castor, which was a relief.\n\n\nThe whiskies arrived, and Remus knocked his back, maintaining eye contact with the two werewolves at the bar - or at least the one who belonged to Greyback. Danny followed suit. Greyback\u2019s man inclined his head slightly, considering, and then extended a hand. He had long, thick fingernails, black with filth. Remus shook it.\n\n\n\u201cWelcome, brothers.\u201d The man said, shaking Danny\u2019s hand too. Danny was visibly horrified by this, but Remus thought it probably just came across as nerves. And who could blame him. \u201cI am Gaius. Come and sit with us.\u201d\n\n\nRemus glanced back at Danny, who nodded, and they both followed Gaius over to the table in the corner. The seats looked like ancient church pews, and they were just as uncomfortable to sit on. Remus tried to subtly maneuver himself beside Danny, but Gaius slipped between them, splitting them up. There was nothing to be done; Remus just hoped that Danny knew when to apparate.\n\n\nThe scent of all of them gathered together was overwhelming and exciting. Remus felt alert, full of energy - but also very safe, almost comfortable. It was no wonder werewolves were so easy to recruit, he thought. People spent their whole lives in search of a feeling like this; it was a feeling he knew well. He\u2019d had it ever since the marauders became animagi. Pack. Family. Home.\n\n\n\u201cBrother, sisters,\u201d Gaius was saying, \u201cThis is Jeremy,\u201d he gestured at the fair haired, handsome man he\u2019d been talking to at the bar. \u201cAnd these two are\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDaniel.\u201d Danny said, stiffly. He drank from his glass, eyes darting around. He kept looking at the women, and Remus knew why. Gaius nodded agreeably, then looked at Remus expectantly.\n\n\n\u201cRemus Lupin.\u201d He replied, steadily.\n\n\nThe atmosphere shifted, the two women leaned in closer, eyes glittering, teeth bared in what might have passed for a smile.\n\n\n\u201cRemus Lupin.\u201d Gaius said. \u201cThe cub who attacked our brother Castor and our sister Livia.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI defended myself.\u201d Remus said, raising his chin. Any sign of weakness would be exploited.\n\n\n\u201cWe were under the impression that Remus Lupin has made his choice.\u201d One of the women said, her voice low and rasping.\n\n\n\u201cI wanted to complete my studies. I\u2019ve finished school, now,\u201d Remus said, reasonably, \u201cI\u2019m exploring my options.\u201d\n\n\nThe two women continued to glare at him, clearly not believing a word he said. But Gaius raised his hand.\n\n\n\u201cOur father is forgiving and generous,\u201d he said, smiling, \u201cHe welcomes all of his children.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBrother,\u201d one of the women said, \u201cHe is not to be trusted! He is Dumbledore\u2019s lapdog!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe was elevated by Greyback\n\n\nhimself\n\n\n.\u201d Gaius snapped, sharply, turning his head and twitching his left hand, turning the wrist. The woman who had spoken up went rigid, suddenly, eyes wide, as if she was gripped by some enormous pain. \u201cSo hold. Your. Tongue.\u201d Gaius said, turning his wrist again.\n\n\nThe woman relaxed, breathing hard. They could all hear her heart thumping. Remus felt sick.\n\n\nGaius smiled around the table.\n\n\n\u201cBrothers,\u201d he said to the three new recruits, \u201cOur father, Fenrir Greyback, welcomes you into his pack. We have been shut out, like you, we have been denied shelter, friendship, protection. Our father would return these things to you - and much more.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d Remus asked, hoping his voice sounded pleasant and inquisitive.\n\n\nGaius gave him a look. Remus returned it. It was strange. He knew that the thing to do - the correct thing to do for the mission, for his safety and for the other werewolves, was to lower his head, to look subservient, stay quiet. He had to get them to trust him.\n\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t do it. Maybe it was nerves, or the strength of their scent and their power so close to him, or maybe it was just that old Lyall Lupin belligerence, but Remus found himself doing exactly the opposite. He held high head higher, taking advantage of how much taller he was than the others, even seated. He made clear eye contact and said,\n\n\n\u201cI just wanted to know how Greyback plans to provide us with shelter, friendship and protection.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou will see, in time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight, well that\u2019s not very convincing.\u201d Remus shrugged, \u201cSounds to me like a lot of promises, but not much of a plan, what do you two think?\u201d He looked at Danny and Jeremy, the blond man.\n\n\nDanny just stared at Remus, looking appalled. Jeremy, unaware of what was going on, shrugged,\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how he does it, as long as he does. Got nowhere else to go, my folks kicked me out.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat if you did have somewhere to go, though?\u201d Remus said, quickly, \u201cWhat if there was a safe place, and you didn\u2019t have to pick any sides in the war--?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus Lupin, you are confused.\u201d Gaius said, raising his voice. \u201cNo such place exists for us. The humans have made it perfectly clear.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe\u2026 the humans,\u201d Remus said, carefully, thinking fast, \u201cThey\u2019re in the wrong, I agree with you - The Ministry of Magic needs reforming - but change can only happen if--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey are not interested. They are only concerned with murdering our brothers and sisters; locking us up, suppressing the wolf.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd what exactly is Greyback going to do about that?\u201d Remus persisted.\n\n\nHe knew why Danny\u2019s pulse was racing; why he kept raising his eyebrows at Remus desperately over Gaius\u2019s shoulder, but Remus couldn\u2019t think about that now. It sounded like madness, pushing Gaius like this when he was clearly giving off danger signs, but it was almost as if Remus couldn\u2019t stop himself.\n\n\n\u201cWhen you meet my father.\u201d Gaius growled, \u201cYou will understand.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to meet him.\u201d Remus said, keenly.\n\n\nGaius\u2019s lips curled,\n\n\n\u201cThere will be time for that. When you have proved yourself.\u201d He looked at the others, \u201cWhen you have\n\n\nall\n\n\nproved yourselves, you will earn the right to call him father.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd how do we do that?\u201d Remus asked, leaning forward, keen to keep Gaius\u2019s attention on him. He knew Danny would never join the werewolves, but this Jeremy kid - he was in real danger.\n\n\nGaius\u2019s whole posture had changed; he seemed larger, his shoulders broader, he frowned at Remus.\n\n\n\u201cThree full moons spent with the pack,\u201d he said, eyes blazing with intensity.\n\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Remus nodded, \u201cYes, ok, I\u2019d love to meet him, can we do that? Can you tell me where--\u201d\n\n\nPain shot through him, excruciating, burning; his bones were melting, his skin was bubbling, he wanted to cry out, but his jaw locked. Gaius\u2019s eyes bore into Remus\u2019s, furious, and suddenly Remus could hear him; hear Gaius\u2019s voice inside his head.\n\n\n\nRemus Lupin you are a fool.\n\n\n\nIt purred\n\n\n\nMy father wishes you to live, but only you. You will be obedient, or I will kill everyone in this room. I will kill\u2026\n\n\n\nRemus felt a strange, sifting feeling inside his mind, and knew what Gaius was doing. He tried to resist, but the pain was such a distraction, he hadn\u2019t the strength. Gaius alighted on something he\u2019d found, his eyes lit up maliciously,\n\n\n\nI will kill... James Potter and Lily Evans\u2026 and Peter, and Marlene and Mary and... I will kill Sirius Black...\n\n\n\nA surge of fury rose up in Remus and it was enough - only just enough, only barely - to break away from Gaius\u2019s fierce grip on his mind and body. He roared, lashing out with his arms and legs, because his thoughts were too muddled to do anything else. Shaking his head, as if to rid himself of Gaius\u2019s wicked voice, he lunged at the other werewolf, forcing him back against the pew, half on top of him, wrapping his hands around his throat and squeezing.\n\n\nThe other three werewolves - Greyback\u2019s werewolves - all tried to move, but Remus was so full of anger and violent emotion that he barely needed to\n\n\nthink\n\n\nand they were locked in place.\n\n\n\u201cIs this what you mean by proving myself, Gaius?\u201d He hissed, squeezing harder, so that the other man\u2019s face was turning red, veins bulging in his temples. \u201cHave I earned your fucking respect now?!\u201d\n\n\nGaius clawed at Remus desperately, but only when he was beginning to slacken and fade did Remus let go. He stepped back quickly,\n\n\n\u201cDanny!\u201d He said, urgently, \u201cWe have to go.\u201d\n\n\nThey had to leave first; they couldn\u2019t be chased out, that would look like they were running away.\n\n\nOh fuck,\n\n\nhe thought,\n\n\noh fuck, why did I do that?!\n\n\nWhat was he going to tell Ferox? Moody would have his bollocks!\n\n\nThe last thing Remus saw before he and Danny appararted was Jeremy\u2019s horrified face.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\u201cMerlin!\u201d Danny yelled, as soon as they were away from there. \u201cWhat the\n\n\nfuck\n\n\n?!\u201d\n\n\nThey were in a field, miles and miles outside of London. They were supposed to walk from there to a bus shelter, where Moody would be waiting for a debrief.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Remus panted, shaking his head, \u201cI got -- I lost my temper.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bloody say!\u201d Danny ranted, \u201cWouldn\u2019t have let you have all that firewhisky if I knew you were going to flip your shit and try and take on Greyback\u2019s whole army single-handed!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat was\n\n\nnot\n\n\nhis whole army.\u201d Remus replied sourly, wiping sweat from his brow. He was still buzzing from the agony Gaius had put him through.\n\n\n\u201cAnd\n\n\nthat\n\n\nwasn\u2019t the bloody mission, was it?!\u201d Danny retorted, \u201cSubtle, you said! Just listen to them, you said!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI realised that wasn\u2019t going to work,\u201d Remus tried to explain, \u201cThey\u2019re a pack; you have to dominate the leader, you need to show them--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou sound like them!\u201d Danny said, suddenly.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou! All of your \u2018special skills\u2019 crap. You want to be like that, do you? No better than a pack animal? A fucking beast?!\u201d\n\n\nRemus stared at him. He didn\u2019t know what to say, he was too giddy, his thoughts were a mess.\n\n\n\u201cLook.\u201d He said, trembling, \u201cLet\u2019s just find Moody.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Danny agreed, still red-faced, \u201cSooner we do, sooner I can get away from\n\n\nyou\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t reply, just started walking. His head hurt so much, a migraine building behind his eyes, the bright summer sunshine was like daggers after the gloom of The Manticore\u2019s Head. His mind was running a mile a minute. How would he explain this? How could anyone hear it and trust him ever again? What worried him most was that his first instinct was to lie.\n\n\nDanny was walking faster than him, but then he hadn\u2019t just had his mind ripped apart by a\u2026 oh fuck. Was Danny right? Was Remus just like them, deep down?\n\n\nThey reached the bus shelter - long abandoned, covered in yellow pollen and sprayed on graffiti. Moody was waiting, punctual as always. He looked at them both, blue eye whirring wildly between them.\n\n\n\u201cWhat went wrong?\u201d He asked, at once.\n\n\nRemus looked at Danny. Danny looked at Remus, then down at his feet. Remus swallowed, and bit the bullet.\n\n\n\u201cI made a mistake.\u201d He said. \u201cI let my temper get the better of me.\u201d\n\n\nMoody looked at him for a long time. He was completely inscrutable, and though Remus knew Moody wasn\u2019t actually reading his mind - he knew how that felt, now - he felt as though he was being picked slowly apart all the same.\n\n\n\u201cTell me everything, lad.\u201d Moody said, finally.\n\n\nRemus did his best. He didn\u2019t mention the whiskies. He didn\u2019t mention the loss of control he\u2019d felt, even before Gaius had hurt him. He definitely didn\u2019t repeat anything Gaius had whispered into his brain. He told only the story Danny might have told. And it worked.\n\n\n\u201cSounds like you acted in self defence.\u201d Moody said, business-like, as if this sort of thing happened all the time.\n\n\n\u201cI went too far.\u201d Remus said. It was easy to be submissive now, to be polite and deferential to someone else. \u201cI acted\u2026 I behaved badly. I put Danny in danger.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself, Lupin.\u201d Moody said, sounding almost kind. \u201cYou were in a tight spot. You both got out of it. Do you need to see a healer? Do you know what curse it was?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was wordless magic,\u201d Remus shook his head, \u201cAnd I\u2019m ok. It wasn\u2019t even as bad as a full moon.\u201d\n\n\nThis was a lie. He could still feel the remnants of it, his head throbbed and his nerves were vibrating. But it was going away. Pain often did, or else you just learnt to get on top of it.\n\n\nMoody laughed gruffly.\n\n\n\u201cGood chap. Right, McKinnon, anything further?\u201d\n\n\nDanny shook his head. He hadn\u2019t said much while Remus was explaining himself, only interjected once or twice to confirm that it was the truth. He still didn\u2019t look at Remus, and Remus didn\u2019t blame him. Moody, if he noticed, didn\u2019t comment on this odd atmosphere. He clapped his hands together. \u201cWell then, I should say we\u2019re ok to apparate now. Lupin, I\u2019m coming with you, got another meeting. McKinnon, you\u2019ll be ok to get back somewhere safe?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah. No problem.\u201d Danny replied, hollow voiced. \u201cSee you.\u201d And began to walk away, back into the field.\n\n\nRemus looked at Moody.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s angry with me. I don\u2019t think we should pair up again like that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d Moody said, briskly.\n\n\nRemus\u2019s heart sank. So that was it. Moody didn\u2019t trust him any more. The auror began to walk in the opposite direction from Danny, across the quiet country road. Remus hurried to keep up. The ground felt weird below his feet, like sponge.\n\n\nMoody stopped abruptly, having apparently judged the shady copse of trees they were now standing in a suitable place to apparate from. He glanced at Remus,\n\n\n\u201cMcKinnon can\u2019t hack it, that much is clear. We\u2019ll have him on communications or guarding a safe house. You\u2019ll be prepared to go it alone, next time?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026 What?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou showed them who you are, today.\u201d Moody said, both of his eyes focused on Remus. \u201cThat's good. That\u2019ll get back to the pack. Stir them up. We want Greyback distracted.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand.\u201d Remus frowned.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d Moody raised a bushy eyebrow. \u201cI think you\u2019re more canny than you let on, Lupin. Right, come on, I\u2019ve an appointment with Fleamont.\u201d\n\n\nThat was that. No more questions. In a matter of seconds they were on the Potters\u2019 back doorstep, answering the identifying questions from Euphemia, and then everything was normal; they were back in reality, surrounded by the gentle warm familiarity of the kitchen. It was like being jolted awake from a nightmare, and you just had to keep reminding yourself everything was ok now.\n\n\nMoody disappeared off towards Mr Potter\u2019s study, and James and Sirius came running through the hallway to meet Remus. Sirius looked half mad, and they stood in front of each other for a moment, wide eyes full of words. Finally Sirius came towards him, enveloping Remus in a hug and burying his head in his neck.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re ok.\u201d He whispered.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ok.\u201d Remus said, fiercely, squeezing him back tightly. And he wanted to say it, oh god, he really really wanted to. But he had no energy left, so he just kissed him, and James was right there, and so was Mrs Potter, but it was the only thing Remus knew that could tell Sirius what he needed to tell him.\n\n\nHe put the rage away, the terror, the guilt and the fierce need for revenge. There would be a time for it. But not yet."

            "content": "Late summer, 1978\n\n\nHe rolled over for the hundredth time, the sheets sticking to his hot skin. He hadn\u2019t felt right since the full moon. Maybe even since before then. He was sleeping only a few hours each night, and now it was almost four o\u2019clock in the morning, and he hadn\u2019t drifted off yet.\n\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t sleep?\u201d Sirius rolled over too.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus sighed, sitting up. \u201cSorry. I should go in the other room.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d Sirius said, rubbing his eyes, \u201cIt's fine, I\u2019m up too now, I\u2019ll keep you company.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really not in the mood to talk.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ok. I can talk, I\u2019m always in the mood to talk.\u201d\n\n\nRemus smiled, though he didn\u2019t want to. Bloody Black.\n\n\n\u201cGo on, then.\u201d He murmured, lying back down slowly. His back hurt from the last full moon, and he\u2019d rubbed some of Marlene\u2019s ointment on there before bed, but it was wearing off already. Sirius rolled over onto his side, stretching an arm over Remus\u2019s body and talking sleepily into his ear.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait for tomorrow,\u201d he murmured, \u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to see the flat finally. I never had anywhere that was just mine before.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMe neither.\u201d Remus replied, eyes closing.\n\n\nSirius had bought the flat the week before, while Remus was recovering from the full moon. It had been - of course - an impulse buy, but Remus thought that was ok, really - he had too much on his mind to be much help, and it was Sirius\u2019s money, after all.\n\n\nIt was in London, and a muggle neighbourhood too. After the Potters\u2019 initial surprise at the boys\u2019 decision, Fleamont had insisted on ensuring that all of the standard security charms and alarms were in place before they were allowed to move in, so Remus hadn\u2019t even seen it yet.\n\n\n\u201cTell me what it\u2019s like.\u201d Remus said, turning into Sirius\u2019s body, curling up. He didn\u2019t make himself small very often - after all he was bigger than Sirius, and it seemed silly. But just now, sleep deprived and filled with anxiety, it felt nice to bury his face in Sirius\u2019s night shirt.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s small,\u201d Sirius said, resting his chin on top of Remus\u2019s head, \u201cJust one bedroom, one bathroom, one kitchen.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSounds massive.\u201d Remus replied. He meant it. He\u2019d never imagined living somewhere like that, not in a million years.\n\n\n\u201cWe can have it however we want; furniture, wallpaper, anything.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave the interior design up to you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine. You can build the bookcases.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBookcases?\u201d Remus raised his head. He hadn\u2019t thought of that.\n\n\n\u201cYep, bookcases,\u201d Sirius replied, a smile in his voice, \u201cSpace for the record collection too, obviously. And there are some garages nearby I might be able to rent\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a car?!\u201d Remus was a bit alarmed by this; he\u2019d only just agreed to keep James\u2019s old broom for travel on Order related business, he really didn\u2019t fancy learning to drive too.\n\n\n\u201cNot a car\u2026\u201d Sirius said, evasively, \u201cBut I was just thinking\u2026 I mean, it would be really useful to have another means of transport.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the tube.\u201d Remus said, \u201cBuses. London is actually sort of famous for them, y\u2019know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHave you already bought it?\u201d Remus pulled away to see Sirius\u2019s face.\n\n\n\u201cEr... \u201c\n\n\n\u201cSirius!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Sirius was grinning mischievously, \u201cIt\u2019s an early birthday present to myself.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYour birthday isn\u2019t for months!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHousewarming, then. I\u2019ll get you something too!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHonestly,\u201d Remus laughed, wrapping his arms around Sirius again, \u201cYou\u2019re a liability. Spoilt brat.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCare home oik.\u201d Sirius replied, laughing, his voice muffled by Remus\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\nThey lay still and quiet for a little while, just like that. Remus relaxed a bit, but he still wasn\u2019t going to sleep. It would be light, soon, surely. Every now and then he thought he could hear a bird singing in the garden. Wouldn\u2019t get that in London. Just rattling milk floats and bin lorries and buses hissing and maybe the odd pidgeon. He couldn\u2019t wait.\n\n\nHe held Sirius a little tighter. They\u2019d been hugging a lot, lately. Contact seemed vital; it reminded Remus he was human.\n\n\n\u201cEverything ok?\u201d Sirius asked, quietly.\n\n\n\u201cFine. Just can\u2019t sleep.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStill not in the mood to talk about it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk.\u201d Sirius sighed a little. Then he moved his head against Remus\u2019s shoulder, turning to kiss the softest part of his neck. Sirius\u2019s hand slid down to Remus\u2019s hip, slowly. \u201cIn the mood for anything else?\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nRemus had sort of expected to see his new flat for the first time alone with Sirius. How foolish of him; he had forgotten that even outside of Hogwarts Sirius and James came as a pair. And wherever James went, Peter and Lily typically went. So it ended up being the five of them catching the train into London the next morning.\n\n\nSirius was buzzing with excitement, unable to sit still the whole way. He bounced about the carriage, ran down the escalators at Waterloo, and hopped from foot to foot on the underground platform. They were all in muggle clothes, and he was wearing his leather jacket, black jeans and combat boots. Remus liked to focus on these details, because if they were muggles then they weren\u2019t at war today.\n\n\nThe flat was off Leicester Square, in Chinatown. It was a seedy part of town, but that didn\u2019t both Remus, nor did it seem of any concern to Sirius. It was crowded and noisy, the smell of chinese food and cigarettes and open drains permeating the air. The phone boxes were plastered with adverts for escorts, and they passed at least two peep show cinemas.\n\n\n\u201cI love London.\u201d Remus smiled to himself. Sirius flashed him a grin.\n\n\nThey entered their building through a door in the back alley of an off-licence, filing in one by one, Peter loudly remarking on how small everything seemed, and how strange muggles were. Then up a short flight of stairs where they reached a concrete landing, with a bright yellow front door. Number 9.\n\n\n\u201cHome!\u201d Sirius said, as he jammed the key into the lock, beaming at them all.\n\n\nIt was small. It was mundane, plainly furnished. It was basic. It was absolutely perfect.\n\n\nThey stepped directly into the living room, which was very modern, with no entrance hall. There was a doorway to the left leading through to the kitchen, which was sunny and bright, a little window over the gleaming metal sink. Lily made a beeline for the fridge - she\u2019d very sweetly brought a bottle of sparkling white wine to celebrate with.\n\n\nRemus went back into the living room, and down a hallway where there were two doors - one was the bathroom - sixties green tile with pink porcelain fittings - the other was a bedroom. Two suitcases - the clothes they\u2019d packed up and sent ahead - sat side by side by the wardrobe. \u00a0The bed was there already, neatly made with a maroon blanket and throw. Not a four poster; no secretive dark hangings. Just a perfectly ordinary bed for two.\n\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d Sirius asked, anxiously, entering the room behind him. \u201cI know it\u2019s really muggle-ish, but I didn\u2019t want to go overboard on the money\u2026 and it\u2019s much easier to protect, Monty even had Moody advising on some of the shield enchantments\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 great.\u201d Remus nodded. He was so happy. He just smiled, staring around. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d there weren\u2019t words.\n\n\nLuckily, Sirius was smiling too, watching him.\n\n\n\u201cI always know it\u2019s good when you don\u2019t have something sarcastic to say,\u201d he winked, \u201cCome on, you barely looked at the living room!\u201d\n\n\nRemus followed him back through. Lily was pouring out tumblrs of sparkling white wine (\u201cWe should have got you proper wine glasses as a present!\u201d), and they all toasted, cheering loudly.\n\n\n\u201cMate, you\u2019ve got to show me how that eclectic oven thing works,\u201d James said, wide eyed, \u201cAnd the radar-eater.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nRadiator\n\n\n.\u201d Lily rolled her eyes, \u201cHonestly,\n\n\nhow\n\n\ndid you get an Acceptable in Muggle Studies?!\u201d\n\n\nPeter was looking at the small brick fireplace, which was very out of place in the contemporary living room with its cream carpet and plastic venetian blinds.\n\n\n\u201cAre you on the floo network, then?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d Sirius nodded. \u201cFor Order stuff, obviously. And you lot. Moody\u2019s made it untraceable. The whole flat is unplottable, too.\u201d\n\n\nRemus couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit put out by the fireplace. Even if it was essential, he didn\u2019t like the idea that members of the order had access to their flat at any time of day or night. The thought of Alastor Moody\u2019s head appearing in their living room made him shudder. Sirius, still watching Remus\u2019s face carefully gave him a nudge,\n\n\n\u201cI got something else, too,\u201d he gestured to the couch.\n\n\nThey all turned to look.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a telly-phone!\u201d James suddenly yelled, almost spilling his drink in excitement as he pointed at the device sitting on an end table by the sofa.\n\n\n\u201cCalm down!\u201d Lily chastised.\n\n\n\u201cA phone!\u201d Remus stared at it, amazed. \u201cIs it connected?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d Sirius nodded, proudly, \u201cJust pick it up and dial - so I don\u2019t have to hang about outside phone boxes any more--\u201d\n\n\nHe was cut off, because Remus had practically knocked him over, throwing his arms around Sirius, and then - because after all, they were in their own home now, took his head in his hands and kissed him long and hard.\n\n\nLily and James cheered again, Peter downed his drink and went to pour some more.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\u201cDo I look ok?\u201d Sirius was peering at himself in the bathroom mirror. He kept buttoning and unbuttoning his shirt. \u201cShould I wear a tie?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Remus laughed, standing behind him, pulling on a plain grey t-shirt over his damp hair. \u201cStop fussing, you look fine.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust fine?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Remus replied, deadpan, \u201cYou look incredible.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Sirius smiled smugly at him through the mirror. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to let you down, I\u2019ve never met anyone\u2019s mum before.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat about Mrs Potter?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe Potters\u2019 don\u2019t count, they\u2019re like my own parents, I don\u2019t need to impress them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be standing next to me,\u201d Remus shrugged on a cardigan to cover his arms, \u201cShe\u2019ll be impressed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d Sirius tutted, \u201cI bet she thinks the sun shines out of your arse.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you ready?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d\n\n\nThey left the bathroom, making their way out of the flat. They had only been moved in for a week and a half, and there were still boxes everywhere, but it already felt like home to Remus. He loved the jangle of keys in his pocket; the sensation of closing the front door on the world; having a place to be himself completely. The cramped soho flat was nothing like as grand as Hogwarts, but already Remus liked it better than anywhere else he had ever lived.\n\n\n(Grant had put it best - Remus phoned him as soon as he had the chance - \u201cA fixed address, eh? Blimey, we\n\n\nhave\n\n\nmoved up in the world.\u201d)\n\n\nThey apparated from the landing outside, which had become a habit; it was secluded enough that no one would see them. In mere moments they found themselves on a quiet residential road in Cardiff, where it was - of course - just starting to rain.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, should\u2019ve warned you,\u201d Remus laughed as Sirius yelped and scrambled to yank up his shirt to protect his hair, \u201cWelsh summers aren\u2019t much better than Scottish ones.\u201d\n\n\nThey made the short walk to the hospital quickly, and Remus led Sirius to Sparrow ward with much more confidence than that first time he\u2019d met Hope. He smiled and gave a little wave to the nurse on duty, before walking to the end of the ward to see his mother.\n\n\nThe curtain was drawn halfway across, so he peered around it first, to check if she was asleep. But no, she was sitting up in bed, flicking through a fashion magazine. He cleared his throat and she looked up. A huge smile spread across her thin face, showing every pearly tooth,\n\n\n\u201cRemus!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d he said, ducking his head shyly and walking around to greet her.\n\n\nHe kissed her lightly on the cheek. He\u2019d done that three times now, having graduated up from her kissing his hand. Progress was slow, but every milestone felt enormous.\n\n\n\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d come today!\u201d She beamed, clutching his hand and looking him over as he folded himself into the orange plastic chair by her bed.\n\n\n\u201cSorry it\u2019s been so long,\u201d he apologised, \u201cI finished school, and then I moved\u2026 um. I\u2019ve brought someone to meet you,\u201d he glanced up at Sirius, still standing just behind the curtain, looking at Hope nervously. \u201cMum,\u201d (second time he\u2019d ever said that to her face), \u201cThis is Sirius Black.\u201d\n\n\nSirius came around and stood at the end of the bed, hands in front of him. He looked like he was trying very hard not to fidget.\n\n\n\u201cPleased to meet you, Ms Lupin,\u201d he said, politely.\n\n\nShe didn\u2019t correct him on the name, only smiled benignly back at him,\n\n\n\u201cHello, Sirius. Are you a friend of Remus\u2019s from school?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he nodded.\n\n\n\u201cSirius and I live together, in London.\u201d Remus said, testing the water. He watched her face, but she was inscrutable. She could be an auror, no problem.\n\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t that sound like fun,\u201d she said, glassy eyed, \u201cYour dad used to take me for trips to London, I loved a go on the double deckers.\u201d\n\n\nAh. She was in the mood to talk about Lyall. These were far from Remus\u2019s favourite visits, but he let her talk, because it seemed to make her happy. She started on a long and rambling story about all the times Lyall had taken her to London, where they\u2019d seen all the sights, and then all of the various other places he had taken her - Edinburgh and Blackpool and Aberystwyth. Remus tried not to listen too hard. He didn\u2019t want to start wondering whether Lyall would have taken them both to these places, if things had been different.\n\n\nEventually, with Hope showing no sign of stopping, Remus gestured for Sirius to take a seat, and he dragged one over from the next bed, which was empty. As he settled in, Remus noticed the suitcase at the foot of the bed. It wasn\u2019t usually there. Was she finally allowed to go home?\n\n\n\u201c...and I had my first ever curry in a little restaurant in Wembley\u2026\u201d she was saying now.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in Chinatown,\u201d Remus said.\n\n\n\u201cLovely.\u201d She smiled, though she clearly had no idea where that was. She was growing increasingly childlike, he thought, must be the medication they had her on. It ought to have been annoying, but it actually helped him empathise with her. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll have your exam results soon, will you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had them,\u201d Remus replied, \u201cI passed everything.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe came top in the school in three subjects,\u201d Sirius said, out of the blue. \u201cHistory, Care of Magical Creatures and Arithmancy - and top marks in everything else!\u201d\n\n\nRemus blushed. That wasn\u2019t strictly true. Ok, he\u2019d earned \u2018Outstanding\u2019 in most subjects, but he\u2019d only got an \u2018Exceeds Expectations\u2019 in Transfiguration.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my clever boy,\u201d she grinned dozily, \u201cJust like his dad.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you going somewhere, mum?\u201d Remus asked, still bothered by the suitcase.\n\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d she nodded, resting her head back against the pile of pillows propping her up, \u201cYes, I\u2019m off to the hospice tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\nRemus\u2019s insides turned ice cold. His throat went dry.\n\n\nNo\n\n\n, he thought,\n\n\nno, I need more time\n\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cTomorrow?\u201d He choked. She squeezed his hand again, her eyes sharpening,\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready, love. It\u2019s time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d he didn\u2019t know what to say. He thought he might cry, but he didn\u2019t want to upset her.\n\n\nSirius looked confused. He didn\u2019t know what it meant.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making sure everything\u2019s in order,\u201d Hope said, matter-of-factly, suddenly sounding much more mature than usual, \u201cIf you leave me your address, I\u2019ll make sure everything ends up where it ought to. And of course the funeral - I\u2019ve told Gethin you\u2019re to be notified as soon as possible, and that you\u2019re sat at the front. Don\u2019t let them put you at the back like some poor relation. You\u2019re my son, and I\u2019ve no shame at all, understand?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMum, please\u2026\u201d Remus looked away, shocked by how distraught he felt. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 just not yet, ok?\u201d\n\n\nHer face softened. She sighed,\n\n\n\u201cAll right, my darling. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\n\nWho the fuck is Gethin?!\n\n\nHe wanted to shout.\n\n\nHow many surprises are waiting for me, after you\u2019re gone?\n\n\nHe\u2019d known this was coming, but it was still the worst news of his life. He couldn\u2019t shake the sense of betrayal. They\u2019d only just found each other.\n\n\nSirius grew uncomfortable in the silence that followed. He didn\u2019t understand Hope and Remus\u2019s shared inability to say the important things; Sirius could never see why everyone didn\u2019t just say what they felt as soon as they felt it. But he respected their privacy, and got up,\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get a cup of tea, Remus,\u201d he said, gently, \u201cWould you like one?\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded,\n\n\n\u201cCanteen\u2019s down the hall,\u201d he said, staring at the floor, still holding Hope\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there, in a minute.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan I get you anything, Ms. Lupin?\u201d\n\n\nShe shook her head,\n\n\n\u201cNo thank you, dear. It was lovely to meet you.\u201d\n\n\nHe inclined his head, gallantly, smiling politely - god, he could be charming in even the most desperate situations - then quickly left.\n\n\nRemus let go of Hope\u2019s hand, and buried his face in his palms.\n\n\nFuck\n\n\n. Couldn\u2019t he just enjoy something for five minutes without a tragedy?\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very nice young man.\u201d Hope said, brightly\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus replied, huffing a joyless laugh, rubbing the back of his head, nervously.\n\n\n\u201cI can see why you like him.\u201d She prompted.\n\n\nShe wanted the unpleasantness over, clearly. Perhaps she wanted to go back to talking about Lyall. Well, he wasn\u2019t going to let her. She wasn\u2019t the only one who could drop bombshells.\n\n\nHe looked at her, trying to meet her eye.\n\n\n\u201cLook, there\u2019s something I really feel like I ought to explain, er. About Sirius. About Sirius and me.\u201d\n\n\nHope closed her eyes with a soft smile and gently shook her head,\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\n\n\ncariad\n\n\n,\u201d she took his hand and patted it, \u201cI knew the moment I saw the two of you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 really?\u201d Remus stared at her. He\u2019d never talked about this with anyone older than himself before.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a feeling for a while. I won\u2019t pretend it makes no difference at all,\u201d she replied, choosing her words carefully, \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t change who you are, my darling boy.\u201d\n\n\nShe reached for his hand again and he held it. She stroked his knuckles softly with her thumb.\n\n\n\u201cYou love him, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Remus felt the familiar panic rising at the sound of that word, but as it was just the two of them, and he felt he owed it to her to be honest, he nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd he loves you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think so. Yes, he does.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I need to know, then.\u201d She smiled again. She let out a great sigh, \u201cLove. It\u2019s the only thing you get to take with you, you know.\u201d"

He looked at the clock on the greasy wall beside him. Five minutes to go, if Pete wasn\u2019t running late.\n\n\nRemus looked at his book again. He hadn\u2019t really been reading it, he was too distracted. He found himself rarely in the mood for studying, these days, between Order meetings, strange and half-explained assignments, visiting Hope in the hospice - which he tried to do every other day, now.\n\n\nOn top of this, Remus and Sirius were learning to look after themselves for the first time. After a week of takeaways, Remus admitted defeat and asked to borrow a recipe book from Mrs Potter. Results had been mixed, so far. Sirius, meanwhile, seemed to have reached crisis point at the state of the bathroom, and dedicated several evenings to finally learning some cleaning spells.\n\n\nThey\u2019d had a fight over whether or not to get a television (Sirius was bizarrely suspicious of this muggle technology; he couldn\u2019t see the point), and then another one over the motorbike (Remus hated everything about it, but most of all the highly dangerous flying charms Sirius was attempting).\n\n\nOther than that, things were going pretty well. Well. As well as anyone could expect.\n\n\nThe clock kept ticking. Remus lifted the chipped mug of tea to his lips, drank, then grimaced. Stone cold. He\u2019d been there an hour at least, but it wasn\u2019t as if he had anywhere else to be.\n\n\nSince the botched mission to Knockturn Alley back in July, Remus had noticed a clear shift in the nature of his missions. He was often paired with Peter, and generally only sent on \u2018soft\u2019 assignments - passing on messages, collecting dead portkeys - once or twice he\u2019d been stuck making sandwiches for visitors to the Potters.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Sirius and James\u2019s fortunes had taken them in a completely different direction. They both spent much of their time with Frank and Alice, or the Prewett twins, up to all sorts of interesting things like advanced defense, guard duties, and even one or two midnight raids.\n\n\nSirius was having the time of his life. Remus was miserable, but not saying so. In other words, business as usual.\n\n\nFinally, Remus looked up and saw movement. It was the end of the working day, and men in smart suits and hats began to fill the pavements. If you looked very closely, you could see that some of these men and women were dressed a bit less conservatively than the others. It was the end of the day at the Ministry of Magic, too.\n\n\nRemus got up, quickly, banging his shins on the orange plastic chair beside him. Hissing through his teeth, he limped slightly on his way out. Outside it was muggy - not sunny, but hot and sticky; headache weather. Thick, queasy storm clouds hung above the grey buildings, and a powerful reek rose up from the cafe bins, old food putrefying in the unseasonable September heat.\n\n\nRemus hung back a moment, waiting and watching, not wanting to be seen. A tall, handsome young man strode past, wearing black robes and a bottle green waistcoat. He had sharp cheekbones and platinum hair, though he was very young - Remus recognised him at once as Lucius Malfoy, the man Narcissa had risked her life to marry. Remus watched him stalk up the street, fleetingly commending Sirius\u2019s cousin on her excellent taste.\n\n\n\u201cOh, hello Moony,\u201d\n\n\nRemus jumped. Peter somehow still had the ability to take him by surprise - you almost never saw him coming.\n\n\n\u201cChrist, Pete, you scared me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell if you hadn\u2019t been perving on Malfoy\u2019s arse--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up.\u201d Remus was already in a bad mood, and much too sensitive to be teased by Peter Pettigrew, of all people.\n\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t expect to see you,\u201d Peter was saying, glancing at his pocket watch and tucking it back into his trouser pocket.\n\n\nHe was wearing a tweed jacket and a stupid little bowler hat, mustard coloured. He looked like an off-brand leprechaun.\n\n\nRemus scolded himself internally, ashamed of himself for being jealous of his friend - who despite only having scooped up a handful of NEWTs had managed to walk into an entry level position in the ministry, no bother.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Remus frowned, \u201cI\u2019m on time, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you get Arthur\u2019s message?\u201d Peter looked up at him, innocently, \u201cGot cancelled. They sent Caradoc.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Remus pursed his lips.\n\n\n\u201cSo we can go home!\u201d Peter said cheerily, \u201cThank Godric too, I\u2019m exhausted. Work was mayhem today, I\u2019m rushed off my feet.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight, of course.\u201d Remus nodded, his shoulders slumping.\n\n\nHe hadn\u2019t got out of bed until midday. Then all he\u2019d done was read the papers and smoke and eat half a loaf of bread - which Sirius had bought only the morning before. This had been his longest conversation with another human being all day.\n\n\n\u201cAre you sure they don\u2019t need us?\u201d He said, hopefully, \u201cMaybe if we went along anyway--\"\n\n\n\u201cBest not,\u201d Peter shook his head, \u201cYou know what Moody\u2019s like about protocol. Anyway, I\u2019m starving, I barely had time for lunch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally? Want to go and get something at the Leaky Cauldron?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry, promised mum I\u2019d be home. She worries, you know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh. Of course.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPadfoot is at your flat, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, he should be back by now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSee you at the next meeting, Moony!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, see you.\u201d\n\n\nThey walked off in opposite directions, Peter heading for the nearest floo grate (he still hadn\u2019t learnt to apparate), Remus for the nearest quiet alley he could slink into and vanish in peace.\n\n\nHe tried to cheer up a bit as he stood outside the door to his flat. He shook himself, attempted to clear his mind, forced a smile. He opened the door.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re back early!\u201d Sirius\u2019s voice trilled from the kitchen, and that was enough to throw Remus back onto his dark mood. It felt like an accusation.\n\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d He grunted, shutting the door and pulling off his cardigan, the hairs on his arms itching and prickling in the heat. It made his scars raised too, like barbed wire.\n\n\n\u201cWhat's up?\u201d Sirius appeared. He\u2019d showered recently, his hair still gleamed. \u201cSomething happen?\u201d\n\n\nRemus snorted, kicking his shoes off and flinging them under the coffee table.\n\n\n\u201cNothing happened. It got cancelled. Or someone else did it. Doesn't matter anyway, it was just busy-work.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Sirius tutted. \u201cWhy would Dumbledore give you busy-work?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause I can\u2019t be trusted to do anything else but they still want to keep me on side so I don\u2019t suddenly go evil.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMoony\u2026\u201d Sirius had his hands on his hips, now.\n\n\nRemus sighed and waved a hand.\n\n\n\u201cForget about it. How was your day?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was\u2026 busy. Long.\u201d Sirius said, carefully, obviously not wanting to provoke Remus any further. \u201cThe usual stuff, you know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Remus muttered. \u201cYou get to hang around with Aurors all day. The best I get is\n\n\nWormtail\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that.\u201d Sirius sat beside Remus on the couch, \u201cYou\u2019re doing plenty of useful stuff, still. And they sent you on that mission at the beginning of the summer, that was huge!\u201d\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t say anything. He hadn\u2019t told Sirius what had happened, how he\u2019d lost control\n\n\nyet again\n\n\n, and how Moody clearly didn\u2019t trust him anymore, and Danny probably hated him.\n\n\nIn the pause that followed, Sirius tutted.\n\n\n\u201cLook, if you\u2019re in a mood, I\u2019d rather just get out of your way. I haven\u2019t had a brilliant day either.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d Remus said, sharply.\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t fine. Part of him wanted to grab Sirius for a kiss, pull him into the bedroom, and apologise for being a dick. The other part wanted a full blown fight, with lots of shouting and swearing. Either way, he didn\u2019t want Sirius going anywhere.\n\n\nSirius sighed and got up.\n\n\n\u201cFine then.\u201d He grabbed his keys on the way out. \u201cGoing to work on the bike,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll get bread on the way back, seeing as we\u2019ve run out\n\n\nagain\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nRemus grunted in response, staring at a hole in his sock, rather than meet Sirius\u2019s eye. They\u2019d make it all up later, they always did.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThe problem with not being at Hogwarts was that Remus never had any idea where anyone was. He missed the marauder\u2019s map sorely, and felt anxious when he pictured Sirius, James and Peter out in the world, facing who knew what.\n\n\nIt typified the way he felt about almost everything now that school was over. At Hogwarts he had been in control; he\u2019d had a place, a certain status. In the real world, he was nothing and nobody; back to the bottom of the deck.\n\n\nAs a mature and educated young man, he knew that he ought to face these new challenges with fortitude; set out to prove his worth, like James and Sirius - and even Pete. But Remus didn\u2019t. He sulked.\n\n\nAfter the cancelled mission with Peter there had been another long and confusing meeting with the Order, and barely anyone had glanced in Remus\u2019s direction. Moody hadn\u2019t been there, nor Ferox, so Remus couldn\u2019t even go and ask them whether there had been any developments on the Greyback front.\n\n\nIt was nice to see the girls - Lily was apprenticing in the potions research department at St Mungo\u2019s, and she and Marlene had made a whole gang of new friends at the hospital. Mary was at muggle secretarial college, and - like Remus - had been unimpressed with her assignments from the Order so far.\n\n\n\u201cS\u2019pose they don\u2019t want my mucky blood blowing anyone\u2019s cover,\u201d she rolled her eyes. He snickered. Good old Mary.\n\n\nSince that meeting, Remus had spent much of his time alone. He slept in, listened to the radio, went downstairs to the cornershop to buy fags, and pretended to read. He told Sirius he was researching defensive magic, but he couldn\u2019t see the point in studying for no reason.\n\n\nRemus was sprawled on the couch one day doing the crossword in a free paper he\u2019d picked up somewhere. Well. He wasn\u2019t so much \u2018doing the crossword\u2019 as trying to write the most imaginative swear words he could think of into the boxes. He was stuck on twelve down, \u2018_ _ _ E _ _ _ _ F\u2019, when the phone rang.\n\n\nIt made him jump; the phone never rang.\n\n\n\u201cH-hello?\u201d He said, croakily, realising it was after one \u2018clock in the afternoon and the first time he\u2019d spoken.\n\n\n\u201cWotcher sweeheart.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGrant?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSomeone else calling you sweetheart? You slag.\u201d\n\n\nRemus laughed, grinning ear to ear.\n\n\n\u201cSarky tosser. Where have\n\n\nyou\n\n\nbeen?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHere and there. Sorry, I\u2019ve had a bit of a busy summer\u2026 er\u2026 you\u2019re at home, then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBrilliant, I\u2019m five minutes away.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSee you soon!\u201d The line went dead.\n\n\nNot knowing what else to do, and mildly stunned, Remus went to the bathroom quickly to check himself in the mirror. He was wearing a creased t-shirt, and threw on a jumper lying on the floor to cover up his scarred forearms. His hair never seemed to change, no matter what he did, so he ran his fingers through the curls and watched them spring back into place. He wished he\u2019d showered when he woke up that morning, but it was too late now.\n\n\nThere was a knock at the door and Remus hurried to answer it, pointing his wand at the kettle as he passed the kitchen door to flick it on. His pulse quickened, and he realised how excited he was to see someone not involved in the war.\n\n\nHe wrenched the door open harder than he needed to, so that it nearly slammed into the wall.\n\n\n\u201cHiya,\u201d Grant stood in the doorway, wide-eyed but grinning, his face round and sunny as it had been at fifteen, chipped tooth and bright clothes and everything else that was right in the world.\n\n\n\u201cHi!\u201d Remus breathed, standing back to allow Grant entry, \u201cI\u2019m so happy to see you!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBlimey,\u201d Grant nudged him with his trainer as he came inside, \u201cIf I\u2019d known I\u2019d get this sort of welcome I\u2019d \u2018ave shown up weeks ago.\u201d\n\n\nHe stood in the middle of the living room, hands on his hips, staring around it awe. He let out a low whistle, \u201cDone alright for yourself \u2018ere, eh? Very nice.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I s\u2019pose,\u201d Remus rubbed the back of his head. It was a bit messy, old newspapers and half empty mugs of tea all over the place, not to mention the overflowing ashtrays. Suddenly he was very embarrassed.\n\n\n\u201cWhat you got a fireplace for?\u201d Grant chuckled, \u201cThought these modern flats all had central heating?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d Remus mumbled, \u201cCup of tea?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cChampion.\u201d\n\n\nRemus went into the kitchen, and used a bit of wordless magic to hurry it all along, before bringing the mugs through to the living room, where Grant stood inspecting the book case. He looked so well. His clothes were clean and smart - he was even wearing a dress shirt, which had a wide floral collar and cuffs.\n\n\nRemus gave him his tea, and did a bit of quick tidying before sitting down.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here.\u201d He said. Grant laughed,\n\n\n\u201cMe neither, to be honest. Been a long time, eh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow was your holiday?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, er\u2026\u201d Grant appeared to be blushing. His ears turned cherry red. \u201cThat was a bit of a fib\u2026 I just didn\u2019t want to jinx anything.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJinx what? What have you been doing?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI um. Look, don\u2019t laugh at me, all right? I\u2019ve been doing evening classes. You know, get my O-Levels.\u201d He looked down.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s brilliant!\u201d Remus said. Grant looked up at him cautiously, as if waiting for the punchline.\n\n\n\u201cBetter late than never, I s\u2019pose. I had my CSE Maths exam today, over in Russell Square. Bloody difficult, but I reckon I did enough to pass. Fucking Pythagoras was a right tosser, eh?\u201d\n\n\nRemus laughed.\n\n\n\u201cWell done, though! What brought that on?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWant to work somewhere other than a pub, one day.\u201d Grant shrugged, \u201cShagging all them students opened my eyes a bit. Don\u2019t want to be a thicko all my life.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou are not thick.\u201d Remus said, firmly, giving him a stern look.\n\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see,\u201d Grant waved a hand, shy again. \u201cIf I get my Maths and my English sorted - and I reckon I did ok on English too - you ought to see my spelling, it\u2019s miles better - then I\u2019m \u2018oping I can start A-Levels in January. I wanna do psychology, I think.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPsychology.\u201d Remus said, in awe.\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Grant chuckled, \u201cRicky - that\u2019s one of the students I was seeing - \u2018e reckoned I better do Politics, but to be honest I\u2019ve had it up to \u2018ere with Trotsky. \u2018E was a communist.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTrotsky?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRicky.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Remus sipped his tea, thoughtfully. Everyone was doing things. Everyone had a direction. And here he was, just sitting by and watching, as per usual. Self-hatred rose inside him.\n\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 how\u2019s Sirius?\u201d Grant asked, politely.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, good. He\u2019s out just now. Um... Uni lecture.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNice. And\u2026 your mum? How\u2019s she?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDying.\u201d Remus grunted.\n\n\n\u201cBummer.\u201d\n\n\nRemus practically spat his tea out, laughing. Grant grinned.\n\n\n\u201cOi, did ya hear about St Eddy\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat about it?\u201d Remus frowned.\n\n\n\u201cShut down. Last Approved School in Britain, apparently - they\u2019re all \u2018Community Homes\u2019 now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened to all the boys?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSome of them sent to Borstal. The rest got re-housed. They\u2019re knocking it down, putting up flats instead.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood riddance.\u201d Remus said, darkly.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that,\u201d Grant snorted, raising his mug of tea. They chatted for a bit longer, reminiscing. Grant wasn\u2019t seeing anyone serious, and didn\u2019t know how much longer he\u2019d be in Brighton. He missed London, but he knew he needed to save up more money if he wanted to move back and make a proper go of it. He was so different from the last time Remus had seen him.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Nuff about me, what about you? You at uni too?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really doing anything.\u201d Remus sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get a job right now. I\u2019ve mostly just been here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLucky you\u2019ve got this set up, eh?\u201d Grant gestured around, picking up the cigarette box on the coffee table and shaking it. Remus nodded, and took one himself too.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, lucky.\u201d He said, glumly, as he lit it.\n\n\n\u201cYou need to get out more, sweetheart.\u201d Grant said, sounding serious.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\nGrant tutted, blowing smoke and looking Remus up and down.\n\n\n\u201cLook at you, you miserable git. I\u2019m not blind, y\u2019know. Cooped up in here feeling sorry for yourself, is it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus,\u201d Grant sighed, shaking his head, \u201cI\u2019m not being \u2018orrible, I\u2019m just saying. Remember when I left St Edmund\u2019s, and I lived in that squat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026?\u201d Remus wished he could forget that, but it was burned in his memory. The dirty mattresses, the bare floorboards, the damp.\n\n\n\u201cI thought it was great at first - no more school, no more matron telling me what to do, just me looking out for myself.\u201d He shook his head, pursing his lips, \u201cI liked running away. I done it all the time, when I was a kid. Run away from me mum, from me grandad - the prick - from anywhere people tried to keep me in. And the thing is, they always\n\n\nlet\n\n\nme. Matron never called the police, mum never tried to find me. Actually, you were the only person who ever tried to track me down.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Remus hadn\u2019t known that.\n\n\n\u201cI dunno how you did it,\u201d Grant chuckled, scratching his chin, \u201cMaybe you\u2019ve got a magic wand or summink. But you found me. Twice. Thought about that a lot, over the past year.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI just wanted to make sure you were ok.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know ya did,\u201d Grant smiled, softly, \u201cThat\u2019s what amazed me. Here\u2019s this lad - this clever, funny, posho lad - who\n\n\ngives a shit\n\n\nabout me, when no one else ever did. Made me feel like someone worthwhile. So I thought I\u2019d better\n\n\ndo\n\n\nsomething worthwhile.\u201d\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t know what to say. He put his tea down.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to wait \u2018til my exams were all done before I saw ya,\u201d Grant continued, \u201cEven if I fail the lot, I wanted to tell you I\u2019d done it, I\u2019m trying to be better.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou never needed to prove anything to me,\u201d Remus said, earnestly.\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Grant nodded, \u201cI did it for me, really. I did it because running away and avoiding all the stuff that made me feel like shit was pointless in the end. If you want people to think you\u2019re worth it, you\u2019ve got to start acting like you want it.\u201d\n\n\nRemus laughed humourlessly,\n\n\n\u201cSounds like you\u2019re already taking psychology.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBeen reading lots,\u201d Grant winked, \u201cYou get what I\u2019m telling you, then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Remus sighed.\n\n\nDo something worthwhile. Stop moping.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d Grant said, brightly, \u201cCos if you\u2019re not happy here, I\u2019ll switch wiv ya. Nice flat, lots of books, gorgeous boyfriend\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus laughed again, and kicked Grant\u2019s shin playfully,\n\n\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNever. Anyway, best be off, I\u2019ve got a train to catch - I\u2019ll be popping back in a month or so, though, s\u2019long as I get the results I need.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou will.\u201d Remus said confidently, \u201cI know you will.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCheers. Give me a ring soon, eh?\u201d\n\n\nThey hugged at the door, and Remus watched him go, hopping down the steps two at a time, whistling a pop tune.\n\n\nRemus felt lighter; his cheeks ached from smiling. He closed the door and looked at the messy room. He felt like doing the washing up. Then he might nip to the shops and get something in for dinner. Sirius had been out all day; he\u2019d like coming home to a proper meal.\n\n\nTomorrow, Remus could make a proper start on everything else. There was so much to do."

He rolled onto his back, pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes, hoping to mitigate the headache threatening to start gnawing on his brain. He turned his head slightly and addressed the lump under the duvet,\n\u201cYou awake?\u201d\nThere was a sort of a shudder and a grunt. Remus tutted. It was too hot in the bedroom, even for December. He got up and went to the window to crack it open. He pressed his forehead against the cold glass and let the cold air wash over his hot skin.\nThey\u2019d been out at the Leaky Cauldron the night before - pre-Christmas drinks. The marauders and Lily would be spending Christmas itself at the Potters, but everyone who was working had finished for the year, and Mary had suggested blowing off some steam away from the older members of the Order of the Phoenix, for once.\nAs with most of Mary\u2019s ideas, it was brilliant fun. Marlene came, and brought Yaz, who was visiting the McKinnons because her family didn\u2019t do Christmas anyway. Frank and Alice popped by to say hello, and Sirius and James insisted on getting in every other round.\nAfter last orders, those still standing had piled into a taxi back to Remus and Sirius\u2019s flat, where they may not have had any milk or bread in, but the bar was always fully stocked.\nEverything had been a bit of a blur, after that. Remus had a horrible feeling that he and Lily had started singing muggle Christmas Carols at some point.\nHe groaned loudly, \u201cWhy did you let me drink so much?!\u201d\n\u201cOi, don\u2019t blame me!\u201d Lily suddenly appeared, her fluffy red hair sticking up like a dandelion as she emerged from under the duvet.\nRemus jumped, whirling around. He wrapped his arms protectively around himself,\n\u201cFucking hell, Evans, what are you doing here?!\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t get James to leave,\u201d she yawned, \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t going to sleep on the couch, they started building a fort.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the second time you\u2019ve shown up in my bedroom unannounced, Evans, people will talk.\u201d Remus searched for a t-shirt.\n\u201cSecond time I\u2019ve caught you in your pants too,\u201d she laughed, \u201cOh get back in, you big jessy, it's still early.\u201d\nHe did, but only because the room was cold now, and he didn\u2019t fancy finding out what James and Sirius had done to the living room. T-shirt on, he crawled back under the duvet, and Lily wrapped her arms around his waist, her long hair tickling under his chin, like Sirius\u2019s did. He stroked her shoulder. She was so nice and small.\n\u201cD\u2019you reckon if I\u2019d agreed to go out with you in fourth year this is what our life would be like?\u201d He asked, conversationally.\n\u201cOh god,\u201d she groaned, covering her eyes with her fingers, \u201cDo you have to remind me?!\u201d\nHe laughed,\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re embarrassed, I was the oblivious one.\u201d\n\u201cI had such a crush on you!\u201d\n\u201cShh,\u201d he chuckled, \u201cJames took weeks to forgive me, I had to swear under truth serum that I had no nefarious intentions towards you.\u201d\n\u201cThat idiot. I love him.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad it\u2019s Christmas,\u201d she sighed, \u201cWe all need a break, don\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be packing today, then at James\u2019s parents this evening - will you be there?\u201d\n\u201cSirius might,\u201d Remus said, \u201cI\u2019m visiting my mother. You know she's\u2026 um. She\u2019s in the hospice, now.\u201d\n\u201cOh, of course!\u201d Lily gave him a squeeze. \u201cSorry love. How is she?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they expected her to make it all the way to Christmas. But she's hanging on.\u201d\n\u201cOh Remus.\u201d Lily sighed, sadly.\n\u201cS\u2019fine.\u201d Remus pulled away, deciding he might as well get up after all. \u201cRight. I need a cup of tea and a ciggie.\u201d He said, getting out of bed and pulling his jeans on.\n\u201cUgh, you two really need to give up smoking,\u201d Lily said, sitting up, \u201cThis duvet stinks.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve never had a cheeky post-coital fag, Evans?\u201d Remus winked, heading for the door.\n\u201cPost c--?\u2026 oh my god,\nRemus\n!\u201d\nHe was still smirking to himself when he entered the living room, which looked like a bomb had hit it. The sofa had been moved to the middle of the room for some reason, and the cushions removed. James was fast asleep, sprawled across what looked like a giant cream mattress on the floor. Sirius was curled up at James\u2019s feet with one of Remus\u2019s jumpers rolled up under his head.\nRemus edged into the kitchen, flicking the kettle on. Every surface was sticky with something sweet and alcoholic; there were mugs and glasses sitting about, half full, some with half-smoked cigarettes floating in them. Remus grimaced and felt his stomach contract, so he opened a window for air. He really didn\u2019t want to be sick, if he could help it.\nMary had written \u2018Merry Christmas, Blood Traitors!\u2019 on the fridge door in cheerful pink lipstick, with three big \u2018X\u2019 kisses below. She was spending the rest of her Christmas in Jamaica - the first time she had ever visited her grandparents\u2019 home country. Remus was glad of it. Christmas had never been a good time as far as the war was concerned, and having Mary as far away from danger as possible made him feel a bit better.\nHe wasn\u2019t thrilled about doing Christmas at the Potters - though he felt guilty even thinking that. Sirius would never consider spending the holiday anywhere else, so of course Remus would go along with it - and it wasn\u2019t anything to do with Mr and Mrs Potter, who had been better to him than any real family he had. It was the war, and the Order, and bloody Moody, who was sure to be there too.\n\u201cIs that the kettle?\u201d Sirius wailed from the living room.\n\u201cYep.\u201d Remus called back, \u201cTwo ticks.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a hero amongst men, Moony,\u201d James said when Remus arrived in the living room with a tray of milky cups of tea.\n\u201cOh, I know,\u201d Remus nodded, sipping from his cup. He perched on the arm of the sofa, \u201cWhat the fuck have you done to my furniture?\u201d\n\u201cBrilliant, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Sirius grinned up at him, cross legged on the gigantic sofa cushion, \u201cProngs\u2019 idea - we did an engorgement charm.\u201d\n\u201cShall we help you two clean up?\u201d Lily asked, padding through from the bedroom. She picked up a cup of tea and sat down next to James, leaning into his shoulder sleepily.\n\u201cBreakfast first.\u201d Remus said, quickly. \u201cFry up?\u201d\n\u201cFry up.\u201d They all agreed in unison.\nThey went to the nearest greasy spoon cafe and ordered Full Englishes all round, after which everyone felt much better prepared to face the day. After breakfast, Sirius, Lily and James started work tidying the flat, while Remus (at Sirius\u2019s insistence) got himself ready to visit Hope.\nHe didn\u2019t wear a suit; that would have been overkill, even at Christmas, but he made an effort, ironing his cleanest grandad shirt and putting on a brown corduroy jacket he\u2019d picked up at Portobello market. He even polished his shoes.\nSirius had offered to come with him, but Remus preferred to go alone. It was easiest if he had time to process his interactions with Hope in private, which he hoped Sirius understood. Anyway. No one wanted to be stuck sitting in a building full of dying people two days before Christmas.\nThe Hospice itself was on the other side of Cardiff. It didn\u2019t feel much different from the hospital, except that the rooms were private, and furnished with a bit more care. She had fresh flowers every day now, which was nice. Remus brought a poinsettia, because Lily had told him they were christmassy, and Hope was no longer eating solid food, so chocolates were out.\nSomeone had wound gold and silver tinsel around her bedframe, and blu-tacked christmas cards to the walls. There were so many it looked as though she had special festive wallpaper.\n\u201cShe said that if you came while she was sleeping, I was to wake her up straight away,\u201d said the cheerful nurse on duty.\n\u201cThanks, I\u2019ll wake her,\u201d he smiled.\nHis mother lay dozing softly in her big hospital bed. He wondered how tall she was, standing up. Quite small, he imagined - based on the pictures he had of her with Lyall, and how tiny her hands were. He had only ever seen her lying down, and now he realised he might never see her any other way.\nHe touched her hand, gently, squeezing it with his fingers. Her eyelids fluttered, and she frowned, the pain evident in her face. She turned her head and saw him, and her brow smoothed at once,\n\u201cHello my darling,\u201d she said thickly, as if her mouth was full of cotton wool.\n\u201cMerry Christmas, mum.\u201d He said, sitting down.\n\u201c\nNadolig llawen\n,\u201d she said, in neat earthy Welsh.\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d\n\u201cBetter for seeing you,\u201d she smiled. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve come.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d He said, earnestly. \u201cIt's Christmas.\u201d\nThere had been no talk of his visiting her on Christmas day itself. They\u2019d both skirted around the issue and Remus assumed that she wanted to spend it with her real family.\nShe asked now, though.\n\u201cWhere will you be? At home with Sirius?\u201d It was strange to hear her say his name, with her soft rolling r\u2019s.\n\u201cAt our friend\u2019s parents,\u201d he replied, \u201cThe Potters - you met Mrs Potter, once, she told me. Euphemia.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t remember,\u201d she shook her head. \u201cI\u2019d invite you here, but it won\u2019t be much fun for you, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever you like, mum.\u201d He said, hoping he didn\u2019t sound disappointed.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be happier with your friends.\u201d She said, as if to herself.\n\u201cMr Potter knew Lyall,\u201d Remus prodded a bit harder, wanting to talk about something more substantial. \u201cThey worked at the ministry together, and they went to the pub sometimes, and James - their son - he was born in March, same as me--\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d Hope said, more forcefully this time. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Remus, I don\u2019t. Lyall kept those things separate. It\u2019s often better that way, you\u2019ll learn.\u201d\nHe thought about this. Thought about how little he\u2019d known about his parents for most of his life, and how little he\u2019d known about himself as a result. He thought about Sirius, and how they always fought because Remus wasn\u2019t open enough. How much it hurt other people to keep secrets, even when you were trying to protect them.\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree.\u201d He said, simply. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to hide things all the time.\u201d\n\u201cWell.\u201d Hope said. She looked away, and withdrew her hand from his.\nRemus realised that she was annoyed with him. It was an odd sensation, and a first for their relationship. He wasn\u2019t sure how to react. If he\u2019d known her all his life, then he would know what to do; it would be old hat, bickering with your mum. His temper rose the more he thought about it - this was all her fault, his stupid stunted emotions, his complete inability to be comfortable with other people, and here she was, avoiding him.\nHe wanted her attention, and he only knew one way to get it.\n\u201cMrs Potter - James\u2019s mum - she\u2019s great.\u201d He said, \u201cShe makes the best mince pies ever, and a full Christmas dinner,\nand\nshe always gets me a present, even though I\u2019m not her kid.\u201d\nHope pursed her lips, but still didn\u2019t look up.\n\u201cThat sounds nice.\u201d She said in a small, tight voice.\nRemus ploughed on,\n\u201cYeah, James is really lucky. I\u2019d never even had a proper Christmas until I went to the Potters.\u201d\n\u201cYes you did!\u201d\nShe looked up at him, suddenly, and he saw his own anger reflected back in her eyes.\n\u201cYou did!\u201d She said, \u201cWe had lovely Christmases when you were little!\u201d She was staring at him as if he was mad, as if he was the one who was ill, not her,\n\u201cDon\u2019t you remember the tree with the gold angel, and the nativity set? I thought you\u2019d swallowed baby Jesus one year, but you had him under your pillow, because I\u2019d told you about nasty old king Herod and you wanted to keep him safe - you were so sweet. And we bought you that hobby horse, and the farm set - you loved the farm set, the little pink piglets, I was forever finding them in the garden. And the hand puppets, and the army tank - remember your tank? I told Lyall you were too young, you were a sensitive boy, I didn\u2019t like you playing wars, but you loved it, and daddy used to make it move with his magic, and you\u2019d chatter away together for hours...\u201d\nShe trailed off, clearly upset. Remus gawped at her,\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember any of that, mum.\u201d He said. He search for her hand again, and squeezed it. \u201cI wish I did, though. It sounds nice.\u201d\n\u201cI think about you every year.\u201d She said, tearfully, voice shaking, \u201cEvery night I used to light the advent candle and think about you, Remus, and I\u2019d talk about you\u2026 I\u2019d tell Si\u00e2n about you, too.\u201d\nHe snapped to attention. She was watching him warily, as though afraid he might lash out. Aware of this, he kept his voice even,\n\u201cCould you tell me a bit about Si\u00e2n?\u201d\nHope gnawed her lip. She looked so exhausted from the pain and the drugs and fucking cancer, he was starting to feel guilty. But they were almost out of time.\n\u201cShe\u2019s eight,\u201d she said, finally. \u201cShe\u2019ll be nine in February.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s your daughter with\u2026 with Gethin?\u201d Remus asked, feeling as though all of the air had left the room\nHope nodded, closing her eyes. Tears spilled out under her lashes, streaming down her cheeks.\n\u201cI never re-married - not after Lyall. But I fell in love. I had my Si\u00e2n.\u201d\n\u201cOnly Si\u00e2n?\u201d\nShe nodded again. Remus frowned,\n\u201cWhen I first came to see you, the nurse said you were always talking about your kids - I thought you had more than one.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d she looked at him, puzzled, blinking through tears, \u201cYou and Si\u00e2n.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d He felt dreadful. All this time he\u2019d thought he was one of Hope\u2019s terrible secrets.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been ashamed.\u201d She said, a note of defiance entering her voice. \u201cNot of my lovely boy. Never.\u201d\n\u201cMum\u2026\u201d he felt as though he\u2019d been punched in the gut. He was crying too, all of a sudden, and he squeezed her hand desperately.\n\u201cCome here,\u201d she reached out for him, and he got up to sit carefully on the edge of the bed, leaning over so that she could wrap her arms around him. \u00a0He rested his head on her shoulder, trying not to put too much weight on her frail body, but she was stronger than he gave her credit for, and held him tightly.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, mum,\u201d he said, his words muffled by her soft nightgown. She smelled of talcum powder and lavender, and family. She stroked his hair,\n\u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to be sorry for, sweetheart. I love you.\u201d\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d he wept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've looked at clouds from both sides now\n\n\nFrom up and down, and still somehow\n\n\nIt's cloud illusions I recall\n\n\nI really don't know clouds at all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoons and Junes and Ferris wheels\n\n\nThe dizzy dancing way you feel\n\n\nAs every fairy tale comes real\n\n\nI've looked at love that way\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut now it's just another show\n\n\nYou leave 'em laughing when you go\n\n\nAnd if you care, don't let them know\n\n\nDon't give yourself away\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe stayed at the Hospice for longer than usual, and by the time he had apparated to the Potter\u2019s front gate, he was exhausted. He felt like laundry that had been wrung out and splayed on a clothesline, weak and bare and empty.\nJames had to question him at the door - it was second nature now.\n\u201cWhich film did we see in the summer of 1974?\u201d\n\u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d He replied, grimly.\nJames saw the look on his face and stepped aside at once.\n\u201cAll right, Moony?\u201d he asked, putting a hand on Remus\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus nodded, hoping he just looked tired, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be rude, but would it be all right if I just went to bed? Um. Tell your parents I\u2019m really sorry, I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, of course, mate!\u201d James said eagerly, \u201cYou go up, I\u2019ll tell \u2018em you\u2019re knackered.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Remus smiled. He climbed the familiar stairs to bed. He really hoped Mrs Potter wouldn\u2019t mind - he\u2019d be fine in the morning, but just now he wasn\u2019t sure if his nerves could handle seeing her. She always hugged him, too, and being hugged by one mother today was about as much as he could take.\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t long before Sirius poked his head around the bedroom door.\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave you be, if you want,\u201d he said, carrying in a tray loaded with cheese, pickle, ham, crackers and of course Mrs Potter\u2019s famous mince pies. \u201cI just thought you might be peckish?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d Remus grinned at him, \u201cThank you.\u201d\nLooking very pleased with himself, Sirius crossed the room more confidently, and set the tray down on the bed between them. They sat quietly for a while, cross legged on the duvet cover, Remus eating, Sirius pretending not to watch him. When he was finished, Sirius took the tray away, and Remus lay down, stretching out his aching limbs.\n\u201cShall I go?\u201d Sirius asked.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus said. \u201cJust\u2026 don\u2019t expect too much, ok?\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d He lay down next to Remus, on his back.\n\u201cHow\u2019s the hangover?\u201d Remus asked, remembering the state they\u2019d all been in that morning.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Sirius snorted, \u201cEvans and her potions.\u201d\n\u201cGreat.\u201d\nRemus closed his eyes, letting the events of the day settle in his mind. It was good to have Sirius there, he decided. Being alone might be really awful. If only there was a way to express that without having it come out wrong.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a sister.\u201d He said, finally. \u201cShe\u2019s eight.\u201d\n\u201cWow.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d He reached for Sirius\u2019s hand and held it. \u201cIt took her months to tell me. God knows what else I don\u2019t know. I wish we had more time together.\u201d\nSirius squeezed his hand sympathetically. Remus licked his lips, steeling himself for the next bit. \u201cI wish we had more time, but I also\u2026 I also wish she would be more open. It really hurts, knowing that there are parts of her she keeps private.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Sirius was doing an excellent job of keeping his cool. If Remus hadn\u2019t been so sad it would be comical.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He said. He turned to look at Sirius. Sirius turned to look back at him. \u201cSo I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Remus said, nervously, \u201cIf I ever make you feel that way.\u201d\n\u201cMoony--\u201d\n\u201c--It\u2019s just that I get worried,\u201d Remus said quickly, \u201cThat you won\u2019t\u2026 if you knew some things\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you could tell me that would change how I feel.\u201d Sirius said.\nRemus was speechless at that. But it was a good feeling. A happy feeling, even considering the circumstances. He couldn\u2019t look at Sirius any more so he rolled onto his side. Luckily, Sirius seemed to understand and followed suit, draping an arm across Remus\u2019s body. Remus breathed in slowly.\n\u201cThat mission I did, back in the summer? It went really badly.\u201d He said, feeling the weight already lifting.\n\u201cI thought something had happened.\u201d Sirius said. \u201cGo on.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 do you remember how I got, the last time there were werewolves nearby? Like\u2026 really pushy and sort of not thinking? That happened again. No one got hurt, but I\u2019m pretty sure Danny thinks I\u2019m dangerously mad now.\u201d\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen to him?\u201d\n\u201cI think he must have felt it. But we reacted differently. I sort of - took charge. Not on purpose, it just felt natural at the time.\u201d\n\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cThat's what you do on full moons, we have to let you be the leader.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I hadn\u2019t thought of it like that.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026 if no one got hurt, what happened?\u201d\n\u201cOne of the werewolves tried to attack me, but I overpowered him.\u201d Remus said, \u201cI was supposed to get information, but all I did was rile them up.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did Moody say about it?\u201d\n\u201cHe was\u2026 cryptic. I don\u2019t think he was angry. He asked me if I minded going alone next time - without Danny. But he hasn\u2019t sent me on any other missions, not proper ones, and it\u2019s been months\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThey have to be saving you for something.\u201d Sirius said, \u201cI know they have to be - James keeps telling Frank and Alice how good you are at defensive magic, and they just say they can\u2019t do anything without an order from someone above them.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Remus sighed.\n\u201cDid he really say you had to go alone next time?\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say I\nhad\nto\u2026 just asked if I minded. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other way - Danny won\u2019t work with me again, he was too scared. So I suppose\u2026 yeah, it\u2019ll be just me next time.\u201d\nSirius\u2019s arms tightened around Remus.\n\u201cI hate that.\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t have a response, and Sirius didn\u2019t seem to be looking for one, so they just lay like that quietly for a while, until Remus fell asleep.\n* * *\nBoxing Day 1978\nAs Lily had predicted, Christmas Day 1978 was a welcome break from everyone\u2019s troubles. In fact - perhaps because it had been a particularly difficult year - Remus always remembered that Christmas as one of the most pleasant and happy they had together.\nMr and Mrs Potter were slowing down a bit - Euphemia said she wasn\u2019t up to hosting a big party as she usually did, and anyway, the Ministry had warned against large social gatherings. Mr Potter had to be locked out of his study - James and Sirius stole the key - but he saw the funny side, and joined in with the festivities whole-heartedly.\nRemus noticed that this year it was really James and Lily who were the hosts. She co-ordinated most of the cooking, the decorating, the card writing; while he made sure that everyone always had a drink, that all of the usual christmas games were played, and that the house was full of joy at all times.\nAs for presents, it was all of the usual fare - sweets and nuts and candied fruit, new socks and underwear, a pair of pyjamas from Lily as a joke (\u201cso I stop catching you in your knickers!\u201d), and a shiny new pair of doc martens from Sirius.\nSurprisingly, Remus also received a gift from Grant, that year, and felt guilty for not getting him one in return. He laughed when he opened it - a filofax organiser. Grant had written his own address and phone number in the first page, and in the back where the notes had written the heading: \u201c\nNew Year's Resolutions: 1. Stop and smell the roses\n.\u201d\nChristmas Day over and done with, James and Lily were heading to the Evans\u2019s for Boxing Day (James was absolutely dreading it, having met Lily\u2019s sister twice already, and failed to impress her either time.) So Sirius and Remus went back to their own home to settle in and get ready for the New Year. Sirius rather liked the idea of hosting his own party, and Remus was prepared to give in, as long as they only invited people they knew.\n\u201cHow many do you reckon we can fit in this flat anyway?\u201d Remus asked as they opened the door. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019ve got a ballroom, there\u2019s only one sofa!\u201d\n\u201cWe ought to knock through the kitchen, have it all open plan,\u201d Sirius replied, as they walked in. The phone was ringing, and he went to answer it. \u201cHello?\u201d He frowned, then held out the phone to Remus, \u201cFor you, I think?\u201d\nRemus took the receiver from him. Of\ncourse\nit was for him - Sirius didn\u2019t know anyone who could use a telephone.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\u201cHullo? Is that Remus Lupin?\u201d It was a man with a deep voice and a broad Welsh accent. Remus\u2019s insides went cold, and he sat down on the arm of the couch, steadying himself.\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAh, good. Ah. My name\u2019s Gethin Rees.\u201d\nRemus swallowed, and found his throat dry.\n\u201cIs she... She\u2019s gone, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\nThere was a long quiet on the other end of the phone, and Remus began to cry. Finally, Gethin spoke, his own voice sounding very rough.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, lad. Funeral\u2019s next Wednesday.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've looked at love from both sides now\n\n\nFrom give and take, and still somehow\n\n\nIt's love's illusions I recall\n\n\nI really don't know love at all\n\n* * *\n\nTears and fears and feeling proud\n\n\nTo say \"I love you\" right out loud\n\n\nDreams and schemes and circus crowds\n\n\nI've looked at life that way\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut now old friends are acting strange\n\n\nThey shake their heads, they say I've changed\n\n\nWell something's lost, but something's gained\n\n\nIn living every day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday 3rd January 1979\nRemus sighed, staring out of their bedroom window watching the raindrops sliding down the glass. When he was a little boy and it rained, he would sit on the biggest windowsill he could find at St Edmunds and pick two droplets, then pretend they were racing to the bottom of the pane. An idea he\u2019d got from a poem; maybe one Hope had read him, which he\u2019d forgotten now.\nIt always rained at funerals in films. That was called \u2018pathetic fallacy\u2019, Remus had read about it in an old A-level English textbook. Of course, if you had a funeral in Wales in January, the chances of rain were extremely high, too. It was a strange thing to be glad about, but it seemed proper. A sunny day would have been intolerable.\n\u201cReady?\u201d Sirius asked, very gently, entering the room.\nRemus looked up at him, feeling numb, and nodded. Sirius looked gorgeous in a black suit, his hair tied back. Remus felt scruffy, though they were dressed identically, Sirius just wore clothes better. Remus had wanted to cut his hair short, to make it look tidier, but he\u2019d been convinced not to, in the end. Still, the urge to do something drastic was there.\n\u201cTake your time,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got an hour or so.\u201d\nRemus nodded again. The service was supposed to start at eleven, but Gethin had said that if he wanted to come earlier and greet the mourners, then he was welcome to. Remus still wasn\u2019t sure.\nSirius closed the bedroom door, and came to sit next to him. He held his hand, and stared out of the window too.\n\u201cHave you ever been to a funeral before?\u201d Remus asked, finally.\n\u201cUncle Alphard\u2019s,\u201d Sirius replied, \u201cI was only little, though. Nine or ten. Don\u2019t remember it. I\u2019ve never\u2026 lost anyone close.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d Remus inclined his head, still watching the raindrops against the grey sky, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I knew Hope all that well. I didn\u2019t even know her for a whole year.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that matters.\u201d\n\u201cNor do I.\u201d Remus bowed his head.\nHe wasn\u2019t going to cry again, he didn\u2019t think he could. It had felt good at first, a big rush of emotion. But since then, nothing. Just a blankness, and empty feeling he hadn\u2019t had before.\nSirius gripped his hand again.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be with you the whole time.\u201d\nRemus looked at him and smiled weakly.\n\u201cThank you. Ok, I think I\u2019m ready.\u201d He stood up, finally whirring into action. \u201cOh shit!\u201d He said, slapping his forehead, \u201cThe flowers! Padfoot, I forgot to pick up the bloody flowers!\u201d\nSirius put a hand on his shoulder,\n\u201cI got Wormtail to do it, he\u2019s got them. And Lily\u2019s got the address for the church, so we don\u2019t get lost - Prongs has the food for the wake, his mum sent along some pork pies and sausage rolls, and I\u2019ve got the umbrellas sorted. All you need to do is apparate, everything else is taken care of, all right?\u201d\nOverwhelmed, Remus grabbed him and hugged him tightly.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said.\nSirius hugged him back,\n\u201cAnything for our Moony, eh?\u201d\nRemus smiled, breathing in Sirius\u2019s hair, his scent, letting it anchor him. The words popped into his head almost out of nowhere, and finally,\nfinally\n, it was easy to say.\n\u201cSirius?\u201d He whispered, still holding on.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cLove you.\u201d\nSirius kissed his cheek, huffing a soft laugh, which sounded like relief.\n\u201cLove you too.\u201d\nThey walked into the living room hand in hand. James and Peter were also in suits, and Lily in a simple black dress, her usually vibrant hair neatly tied back in a bun. She was carrying an enormous bouquet of flowers. They all gave Remus cautious, sympathetic smiles, which he was getting used to now. He nodded back at them all, gratefully.\n\u201cRight.\u201d Sirius said, taking charge, \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d\nIt was a small village church, just outside of Hope\u2019s hometown - it was where she had been christened, and if she had married a muggle, it was where the wedding would have been. Remus knew from their brief conversations that Hope had not been particularly religious, but that her family belonged to the Church in Wales, so she went along for tradition\u2019s sake.\nIt was a very pretty building - or at least it would have been, if it wasn\u2019t raining so hard. Soft grey granite, with a bell tower and a pointed steeple, simple but pretty stained glass windows. Like a church in a picture book. The graveyard was full of ancient tombstones and stone crosses, but Hope would be cremated, as per her wishes.\nThe marauders and Lily approached slowly, walking up the sodden pathway to join the cluster of mourners gathered in the doorway. Remus spotted Gethin straight away, standing just inside the porch, shaking hands with each attendee as they entered. He was a tall man, like Lyall, but not as spindly. He had dark hair, thick black eyebrows and rather a weak chin. He looked completely broken, and Remus was instantly less nervous about meeting him.\nLily, James and Peter hung back, looking for somewhere to put all the food they\u2019d brought for the wake, which was supposed to be in the church hall around the back. Remus and Sirius silently waited their turn to go in.\n\u201cHullo,\u201d Gethin said, barely looking up as Remus approached, \u201cThank you for coming\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Remus.\u201d Remus said, shaking the proffered hand. Gethin looked up at once, blinking. They were about eye-level.\n\u201cRemus.\u201d Gethin shook his hand weakly, his dark eyes raking Remus over. \u201cHope talked about you all the time. It\u2019s a shame we\u2019re meeting like this.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Remus nodded.\nThey stood awkwardly for a while, just looking at each other, before Gethin came to his senses, \u201cGo in,\u201d he said, gesturing, \u201cYour mum was keen on you sitting in the front row, but it\u2019s up to you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Remus nodded again.\n\u201cSee you after, eh?\u201d Gethin patted his shoulder.\n\u201cYeah. Good,\u201d Remus said, aware that he was speaking in single-syllables.\nIn the end, Sirius had to nudge him into the church, as he seemed to have forgotten how to move. They made their way slowly to the front, and sat down. Remus could hear people whispering about him; a few of them knew who he was, and the reaction was mixed. He ignored it. He was there for Hope, and no one else.\nThe service itself was a blur, and he barely listened. He just stared at the eagle shaped lectern and tried to conjure up a decent memory of his mother.\nThey didn\u2019t sing a hymn, they played a Joni Mitchell song instead. Hope had never mentioned Joni Mitchell to Remus, but he supposed it must have meant something to her. That was a painful thought. They\u2019d had so little time. It wasn\u2019t fair.\nSi\u00e2n was there, of course. Remus recognised her at once - she was the only child present. She was dressed in a cream coloured frock with a black satin sash, and kept her head buried in the lap of an old woman Remus didn\u2019t know - he assumed that was Gethin\u2019s mother, Si\u00e2n\u2019s grandmother. She cried all the way through, and for some reason that was comforting to Remus. Hope must have been a wonderful mother.\nAfterwards, Remus\u2019s legs felt like lead; he was rooted to the spot. He didn\u2019t get up with the rest of the family to walk out (there was no coffin to follow - her body was already at the crematorium, apparently), but waited behind for the church to clear. Sirius waited with him.\nWhen the church was all but empty, Sirius whispered,\n\u201cYou ok?\u201d\nRemus nodded.\nSirius touched his knee lightly, but no more than that. \u201cThat was really sad. It\u2019s ok if you\u2019re tired and want to go home?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Remus shook his head, \u201cI ought to go. I told Gethin I would. Just. Five more minutes?\u201d\nThey had to leave eventually, the caretaker wanted to tidy up.\nThe church hall was very small, and crammed full of people and people\u2019s emotions. Some of them were laughing, reminiscing. Others were still red-nosed and sombre. It was a drab little room, which needed refurbishing; the wooden floorboards were splintering in places, there were notice boards dedicated to drawings by the children who attended sunday school there, and another one for the local scout troup.\nThree trestle tables were groaning under the weight of the food people had brought - piles of sandwiches, meat pies, crisps, cheese and pineapple skewers, fruit cake, leftover turkey curry, slices of ham and other cold cuts. It was a dry funeral, and an old lady in the corner was serving weak cups of milky tea. For once in his life, Remus was not hungry.\nWorst of all, there was a table covered in framed photographs and albums. Most of them were of Hope, and apart from one or two snaps of her as a little girl, not one of them had been taken before 1965. Remus looked at them all, tried to fix the imagine in his mind - a happy, healthy woman who had always tried to do what was best, even when other people let her down.\n\u201cShe\u2019d be so glad you came.\u201d Gethin appeared beside him. He reached out and stroked the glass on one of the photo frames. Hope\u2019s black and white face beamed out at him, static and lifeless.\n\u201cI had to.\u201d Remus said, quietly. Sirius stood at his other shoulder, ready for anything. Remus looked at Gethin, \u201cI wish I had been there. For\u2026 well, to say goodbye.\u201d\n\u201cIt was very quiet, like she was.\u201d The older man said. \u201cShe was awake on Christmas morning, and went to sleep after lunch. There was no pain.\u201d\nRemus hadn\u2019t thought about her being in pain. He wished Gethin hadn\u2019t put that in his head.\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Gethin said, nodding at the photo display, \u201cNo pictures of you. It wasn\u2019t deliberate - she put them all in a box for me to send to you, only I\u2019ve lost track of your address\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want them.\u201d Remus shook his head.\n\u201cRemus,\u201d Sirius said, softly, \u201cDon\u2019t make any decisions yet.\u201d\nRemus just shrugged.\n\u201cThere are a few other bits,\u201d Gethin said, eyeing Sirius with some confusion, then looking at Remus again, \u201cI\u2019ll hang onto them as long as you like.\u201d\n\u201cBits?\u201d Remus looked at him blankly.\n\u201cThings she wanted you to have,\u201d Gethin said. \u201cNot money, or anything--\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in money!\u201d Remus said, sharply.\nGethin frowned, he looked hurt. His eyes were rimmed red, with dark rings under them, like smudges of coal dust. Remus pursed his lips, and took a step back, shaking his head.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t be here. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d And with that, turned and walked straight out of the hall.\nIt had stopped raining by now, but the grass was still wet and the scent of delicious earth rising all around. There was a group of old men sitting on some benches outside. They\u2019d loosened their ties and sat slouched, smoking and passing around an illicit flask of something very strong smelling. Remus tutted, disgusted, and kept walking, wanting to get away from everything.\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Sirius came jogging up the path to catch him, Lily, James and Peter not far behind.\n\u201cI want to go.\u201d Remus said.\n\u201cYou can come back to mum and dad\u2019s if you want?\u201d James suggested, \u201cMum said she\u2019ll do us all dinner.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Remus shook his head, he grabbed Sirius arm, and looked at him, imploring, \u201cPlease, can we just go back to the flat? Just you and me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course we can,\u201d Sirius put his own calm hand over Remus\u2019s desperate one, and Remus felt his heart begin to steady.\nSo that was what they did, Remus promising himself that he would apologise to the Potters and his friends another time.\nBut if he\u2019d been hoping for a respite from the rest of the world, to lock himself away with Sirius and pretend that just for a moment, nothing else mattered, then he was in for a disappointment.\nThere was an owl sitting on top of the mantelpiece when they got in, with a note tied to its scaly leg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemus.\n\n\nMy condolences.\n\n\nPlease meet me at the Auror\u2019s Office at 9am on Monday.\n\n\nA. Moody.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've looked at life from both sides now\n\n\nFrom win and lose and still somehow\n\n\nIt's life's illusions I recall\n\n\nI really don't know life at all"

            "content": "Monday 8th January 1979\n\u201cPlease let me come with you?\u201d Was the last thing Sirius said as Remus left the flat early Monday morning.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Remus shook his head, trying to give Sirius a reassuring smile. He didn\u2019t say what he was thinking, which was \u2018how would that look?!\u2019. It was bad enough he\u2019d been summoned to Moody\u2019s actual office at the ministry; what would he think if Remus brought his boyfriend along for moral support?\nStill, Remus had to admit that he had a difficult time leaving their cosy little home that morning. He\u2019d barely left the bedroom since they\u2019d returned from the funeral, let alone got dressed or left the flat. To go to the ministry he had to wear full robes for the first time since school, which helped a little bit - at least he\u2019d be able to blend in.\nThe visitors entrance for the Ministry of Magic was about twenty minutes\u2019 walk from Soho, and Remus found the early morning stroll more pleasant than he\u2019d expected. It was a crisp, cold January day, and his breath turned white in the winter air. Peter was there to meet him,\n\u201cHiya Moony,\u201d Wormtail smiled up at him, giving him an awkward pat on the arm, \u201cHow\u2019re you holding up?\u201d\n\u201cOh, you know.\u201d Remus shrugged. Grief was a funny thing. He never knew if he was doing it right.\n\u201cLooking forward to saturday!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, me too.\u201d\nThe full moon was due on the thirteenth. So far since Hogwarts the marauders had got away with apparating (Peter side-alonged) to the most remote places possible and transforming there. So far they\u2019d been to the Brecon Beacons, the Outer Hebrides, Dartmoor and the Forest of Dean. No one in the Order had brought it up yet, though Remus supposed they all assumed he was registered.\nPeter and Remus entered the ministry via a telephone box. Peter needed to be there, because after Remus had stated his business, a small silver visitors badge dropped out of the telephone\u2019s change slot. Wormtail picked it up quickly, and muttered the incantation to turn it to tin, before giving it to Remus.\nThey descended into the ministry atrium, which was heaving with activity. It was an enormous hall, bigger than Gringotts, with rows of fireplaces lining the walls. Green lights flashed intermittently from each hearth as wizards and witches arrived for work.\nPeter led Remus through the security stand, where his wand was weighed by a mean spirited wizard with a long beard. Remus was incredibly grateful to have a friend with him, and secretly quite glad it was quiet, genial Peter, rather than Sirius who had a tendency to get a bit overprotective of Remus when it came to the wizarding community.\nNext they moved through to another hall with a set of lifts, and entered the nearest one.\n\u201cYou\u2019re on level two,\u201d Peter explained chirpily, \u201cI\u2019m with the Floo Network Authority on four. Do you need me to show you where the Auror\u2019s office is?\u201d\nRemus thought he would quite like Peter\u2019s help, if only Peter wasn\u2019t so clearly enjoying having the upper hand.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he smiled, \u201cI\u2019ll manage. Cheers mate.\u201d\nPeter gave him a kind smile as he left the lift. Remus nodded back, and the door slid closed.\nSoon enough the tannoy announced; \u201cLevel two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement; including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services.\u201d\nRemus shuffled his way out of the lift and onto the corridor. The lift doors closed behind him with a \u2018ping\u2019 and Remus stood there for a few moments, blindsided. It was a very busy hallway, wizards and witches striding up and down, some deep in conversation, others hastily scribbling down notes on scraps of parchment - and some of them muttering to themselves. Over his head, purple paper aeroplanes zoomed back and forth, fluttering into the office doors which lined the corridor.\nHe wished he hadn\u2019t been so proud now, and asked Pete to walk him to the right office. There had to be a sign somewhere\u2026\n\u201cLupin!\u201d A loud and familiar voice boomed. Remus turned around with some relief and smiled, seeing Ferox barrelling towards him, hand raised in salutation.\n\u201cHi,\u201d he said.\n\u201cLost? Come with me!\u201d\nRemus followed Ferox along the hallway, past office after office until they reached an elaborate door with a carved wood frame.\nAuror Headquarters\n.\n\u201cNervous?\u201d Ferox glanced at him sideways. Remus looked back,\n\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d\nFerox laughed and clapped him on the shoulder,\n\u201cI\u2019d be concerned if you weren\u2019t. C\u2019mon now, it\u2019s only Moody.\u201d And he pushed the door open with one big hand, the other still on Remus\u2019s shoulder, as if to stop him from running away.\nAs a child, Remus had had some experience with muggle law enforcement. Only ever for silly things like running away from the Home, or being caught \u2018causing a disturbance\u2019 - which usually meant he was just somewhere public and other people would prefer him not to be. The police were extra rough with you, once they clocked you were a St Edmund\u2019s boy, they\u2019d call you things and shove you in their car, or else give off thinly veiled threats of physical violence if you didn\u2019t do as you were told. As a result, Remus had never felt that comfortable around authority figures, even if he was a poshboy nowadays.\nHe wasn\u2019t sure exactly how similar the Aurors were to muggle police. He\u2019d only met Moody, Frank and Alice so far. Moody was completely terrifying, but Remus had known him long enough now that he was used to him. Alice and Frank were very nice, very earnest people - but then, they didn\u2019t know what he really was.\nThe inside of the office was very busy, with rows of desks divided up into cubicles. There were posters of criminals, magically enchanted maps and printed lists on notice boards all around the walls, and memos whizzing back and forth. But the most striking thing about it for Remus was the incredibly concentrated scent of strong magic - and dark magic too.\nFerox, hand still on Remus\u2019s shoulder, steered him towards a desk near the back corner, which had the best vantage point over the rest of the chaotic office.\nMoody\u2019s desk and the shelves around it were cluttered with weird and wonderful magical devices; whirring telescopes, glowing crystals, strange humming orbs. Moody himself was bent over a map. Forgetting his nerves, Remus peered over his shoulder to look - he\u2019d never got over his interest in cartography - and Moody barked,\n\u201cNever sneak up on an Auror, Lupin.\u201d\nRemus jumped back, alarmed, and Moody turned to face him, grinning. His mad eye swivelled sickly in its socket.\n\u201cLeo,\u201d Moody reached out and shook hands with Ferox, then with Remus. \u201cGlad to see you\u2019re nice and punctual. Have a seat.\u201d\nHe gestured at a long velvet covered seat against the wall of his cubicle which hadn\u2019t been there a moment ago. Remus and Ferox sat down as Moody cast a spell which muted the noise around them, creating a bubble of peace around his desk that was not dissimilar to James and Sirius\u2019s silencing charms.\nRemus was relieved by the quiet, but Moody\u2019s spell had done nothing to mitigate the overwhelming scent of power which filled his nostrils, swam down his throat and filled up his chest with glorious rich syrupy magic. He tried to relax, to let it find its place in him rather than fighting it, but he felt ever so slightly drunk with it all the same.\n\u201cOnce again, Lupin,\u201d Moody said gruffly, sitting down in his office chair which looked like a plush green leather armchair, but swivelled on one stem. \u201cI was sorry to hear about your loss. I didn\u2019t know Hope myself, but--\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s ok.\u201d Remus said quickly, \u201cI barely knew her either.\u201d\nHe was keen to keep his mother out of any conversation he had today. He hadn\u2019t the strength for two things at once, and if Moody had a mission for him, then that had to be his main concern.\nMoody - who was either an excellent legilimens or simply extremely astute and empathetic, nodded manfully and continued.\n\u201cStraight to business, then.\u201d He said, \u201cGood chap.\u201d He swivelled slightly in his chair to pick up the map he\u2019d been looking at, and handed it to Remus.\nRemus took it eagerly, and looked. It was a map of Britain and Ireland, but not like ones he had seen before - there were no roads marked, no towns or cities, only the woodland areas, rendered in mossy green splodges of ink. Some of these splodges seemed to shimmer and twinkle, as if there were stars hiding beneath the tree branches.\n\u201cGot that from the Control of Magical Creatures office,\u201d Moody explained, \u201cThanks to Ferox here. Know what it is, lad?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d Remus poured over it, \u201cIt\u2019s all of the forests with magic in it? Or magical creatures?\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Moody nodded, looking very pleased with him, \u201cWe\u2019ve noticed that most of the werewolf sightings over the past few years have been in enchanted woodland, forests with a denser population of magical creatures. Now, that could just mean they\u2019re keeping their ears to the ground for you-know-who, or that there are other creatures working with them\u2026\u201d\nOr because the scent of all that natural magic is just too good to resist,\nRemus thought, his own blood fizzing like champagne just from the twenty or so powerful wizards nearby. He didn\u2019t say this, of course, for his own sake.\n\u201c...and for the last couple of full moons there\u2019s been a lot of activity here,\u201d Moody pointed a stubby, scarred finger at a point on the map, somewhere in the midlands.\n\u201cWhy are you telling me now?\u201d Remus asked, \u201cIf you\u2019ve been following them for months?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d Moody said, fixing him with a hard stare, one blue eye, one brown. \u201cGreyback\u2019s in the country for the first time since the sixties; it\u2019s been confirmed.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Remus pursed his lips to quell the rage inside him, rearing up like a cobra, showing its teeth.\nWhere is he?! Take me to him right\n\n\nnow\n\n\n!\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\u201cLast time you made contact you came back with some good information,\u201d Moody continued, \u201cThose who want to join Greyback need to transform with the pack three times, that right?\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d Remus nodded. He wanted to stand up and pace, or do something physical, but he couldn\u2019t afford for either Ferox or Moody to know that there was anything wrong.\n\u201cAnd the next full moon is on Saturday?\u201d\nRemus nodded. He looked at Ferox, then Moody again,\n\u201cYou want me to go already? To start\u2026 to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJust for the moons,\u201d Ferox said, his voice calming, \u201cJust until they trust you.\u201d\n\u201cBut once they trust me,\u201d Remus said, looking at his hands, \u201cThen\u2026 I need to meet him, right?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how things go.\u201d Moody said, choosing his words carefully. \u201cWe\u2019ve three months to plan for that.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d\nRemus didn\u2019t know what else to say. His head was full and his nerves were raw and he felt almost ready to explode, but for some weird reason he just sat there like a polite schoolboy, listening to Moody lay out the plan.\nHe was given a lot of rules. He would have to go alone. He could take his wand, but nothing else. He could tell nobody, not even the other members of the order, not even his best friends. Ferox began suggesting things Remus could say or do to get the pack to trust him, but Remus ignored him. He knew what to do.\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk you out, shall I, Lupin?\u201d Ferox said finally, with a note of paternal kindness.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Remus said, standing up quickly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a man of few words, Lupin,\u201d Moody said, standing up too, holding out his hand once more for Remus to shake, \u201cBut I\u2019ve every faith in you. I\u2019ll send the coordinates before Saturday. Make sure you\u2019re at home to receive them.\u201d\nRemus nodded blankly, shaking the proffered hand. Just as he had guided him in, Ferox led Remus back out of the Auror Headquarters.\n\u201cAlright there, fella?\u201d Ferox asked, once they were clear of the doors. The corridor was a bit quieter than it had been at nine o\u2019clock.\n\u201cYes. Fine.\u201d\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anything you think you need, if you want me to ask Moody for something that will help, you can just--\u201d\n\u201cHow will it help?\u201d Remus asked, suddenly, stopping in the middle of the halway. He twitched his thumb and cast\nmuffliato\n, without any effort at all. Ferox blinked, surprised,\n\u201cHow will what help?\u201d\n\u201cMe, meeting Greyback? I\u2019ve met three members of his pack now, and it\u2019s only made things worse each time.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true. You\u2019ve given us some extremely valuable information.\u201d\n\u201cIf I have,\u201d Remus said, \u201cThen I want to know what you\u2019re using it for.\u201d\n\u201cTo win the war, Remus.\u201d Ferox shook his head.\n\u201cWhen I met Castor last year,\u201d Remus said, his voice very low, but more out of anger than a desire to be discreet, \u201cHe told me in no uncertain terms that they were planning an attack. I told Dumbledore, and what happened? Nothing. The attack went ahead. So I\u2019ll ask again. If I\u2019m gathering information for the Order, if I\u2019m risking my life to do it, then I want to know what for. It\u2019s obviously not to save lives.\u201d\n\u201cRemus, that was an extremely complicated situation--\u201d\n\u201cExplain it.\u201d\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t act, we couldn\u2019t let the werewolves know you were telling Dumbledore anything, we had to preserve your connection with them--\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Remus stared at him, \u201cPeople died! People had their whole lives ruined! Because of me?!\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t think about it that way.\u201d\n\u201cHow would you think about it?! I trusted him! I thought I was doing the right thing!\u201d\n\u201cRemus, calm\ndown\n!\u201d\nRemus realised that he couldn\u2019t. He wished he could apparate right then and there, but nothing happened when he tried, so he marched towards the lift instead.\n\u201cDon\u2019t follow me.\u201d He growled at Ferox, who held the doors open, stopping him from leaving.\n\u201cYou need to get your head straight, kid.\u201d Ferox said, very seriously. \u201cThis is war. It\u2019s not noble, and it\u2019s not always about saving individual lives. You need to get used to that in time for Saturday.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Remus turned his head, glaring at the panel of buttons. The doors began to slide shut, grinding loudly as Remus tested his magical strength against Ferox\u2019s physical muscle. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready.\u201d\nThe doors shut, Ferox snatching his fingers clear at the very last second, and Remus began to move up, back towards the real world.\n* * *\nRemus had barely stepped out of the visitor-entrance phonebox and he was standing before his own front door - he\u2019d stored all of that leftover magic up like a battery, and he only needed to have the slightest want and the magic did the rest. He remembered the curse Snape had thrown at James, which he\u2019d deflected on the last day of school. It would be a useful skill, if only he could depend on it.\nNot only was he full of magic, but his temper had reached boiling point now that he was home. It was a peculiar feeling - similar to the moments before transforming, right before the mind-numbing pain kicked in. A howling, grasping animal longing. God he needed to\u2026 he needed\u2026\n\u201cSirius?!\u201d He burst through the door, yelling. No luck, the flat was empty. Remus gave a frustrated growl and kicked the wall, knocking a hole through the plasterboard. \u201cFuck.\u201d He muttered.\nSirius come\n\n\nhere\n\n.\nHe pressed his palm against the top of the wall and forced some magic out. The hole at the base of the wall closed over at once, thank goodness. It wasn\u2019t enough. He had more; he needed to vent it, a release valve. He pulled off his robes and then his jumper, tossing them onto the couch, pacing the room in his thin t-shirt and trousers. He could go for a run. He could apparate to the Lake District for a few hours and just run around like a madman. He could turn the wall to sponge and start punching it until he\u2019d run out of energy. He could drink himself into oblivion. As long as he did\nsomething\n.\n\u201cMoony?!\u201d\nThe front door opened, and there was Sirius.\n\u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, weirdest thing,\u201d Sirius closed the door behind him. He smelled of petrol and motor oil and leather, and Remus felt himself stiffen instantly.\nOh. That would work.\n\u201cI was working on the bike up the road, and then\u2026 I dunno, I could have sworn I heard your voice. But if you only just got back then it can't have been--\u201d\nRemus couldn\u2019t take it anymore, he crossed the room in two strides and pushed Sirius up against the door, kissing him hard. Sirius kissed him back, eager to please as always. Remus pressed harder, taking Sirius\u2019s lovely white wrists, smeared with oil, holding them and pushing a knee between his legs. He began to kiss down Sirius's neck, next, nipping at the soft flesh there, and Sirius gasped,\n\u201cBloody hell, are you all right?\u201d\n\u201cMmm.\u201d Remus moaned, \u201cJust want to\u2026\u201d\nSirius moved his hip slightly, pressing into Remus\u2019s rigid cock - it felt like electricity, and Remus almost lost control altogether, squeezing Sirius\u2019s wrists, slamming his eyes shut as he fought to hang on. He wasn\u2019t the only one that felt it,\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Sirius panted, helpless in Remus\u2019s grip, \u201cWas that you? You feel\u2026 what\u2026 what\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMagic,\u201d Remus managed to stammer, eyes still closed, rolling his forehead against Sirius shoulder dizzily, \u201cThere was so much\u2026 I just\u2026 um\u2026\u201d\nAnd suddenly it was Sirius who was in control, he\u2019d turned the tables and now he was pulling Remus to the bedroom, and thank god the flat was small, and thank god there was no need anymore for silencing charms or secrecy, because this was simply\nnot the time\n.\n\u201cNeed you,\u201d Sirius was saying incoherently, pulling off his shirt and then tugging at Remus\u2019s, black greasy fingerprints getting everywhere, \u201cNeed to feel you everywhere...\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Remus returned, intoxicated, \u201cYes yes yes\u2026\u201d\nWhatever he was feeling, he knew Sirius could feel it too, as he pushed the magic outwards, filling the room with it, igniting every touch.\nRemus groaned as their bare skin finally met and Sirius closed his eyes and shuddered. Grasping fingers and gritted teeth. Any sense of concern or shame was obliterated by the heat erupting between them. Remus gave in and thought of nothing else as he selfishly arched and bucked against Sirius, who kept feverishly whispering, \u201cOh Moony, Moony\u2026\u201d over and over. Their fierce rhythm increased as they began to tense and contract. Gasping as the world exploded, for a few blissful seconds everything went white.\nThat wasn\u2019t enough. They had to go twice more before Sirius was satisfied, and Remus still felt like he could run a marathon.\n\u201cIf you're planning to visit the Auror\u2019s Office again,\u201d Sirius breathed hoarsely, \u201cI\u2019m going to need some warning.\u201d\n\u201cSor--\" Remus started, but Sirius clapped a hand over his mouth, grinning,\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare apologise. I mean fucking hell.\u201d\nRemus laughed, pulling his hand away. He waved a hand at the window lazily, and it slid open, letting cool winter air in.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Sirius raised his eyebrows, \u201cHow long does that last?\u201d\n\u201cIt's going away,\u201d Remus said, closing his eyes. It was; he could feel his heart slowing down, his muscles relaxing. \u201cLast time Snape\u2019s curse drained it, so I s'pose any kind if counter magic works.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019d prefer this to cursing you\u2026\u201d Sirius rolled over and stroked Remus\u2019s bare hip.\n\u201cMm.\u201d Remus murmured in agreement, eyes still closed.\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Sirius said, his hand still now, his voice more solemn, \u201cIt either went really well or really badly at the ministry\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cBoth.\u201d Remus flung his arms over his face. \u201cDo we have to talk about it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah I think we do.\u201d\nRemus sighed heavily. He sat up, reaching for his cigarettes.\n\u201cGreyback\u2019s in England.\u201d He started.\nSirius sat up at once, frowning. He took a cigarette from the box Remus held out, placed it between his lips, lit it, and looked at Remus very seriously.\n\u201cTell me everything.\u201d\nAnd Remus did."

He rubbed his temples. He was getting a headache, not uncommon on a full moon.\n\n\n\u201cI mean I\n\n\nreally\n\n\nhate this.\u201d Sirius puffed, staring out of the window. He stood there, one arm folded across his narrow waist, other arm crooked at the elbow so that he could hold the cigarette to his lips. He had to keep stretching up on his tiptoes to blow the smoke out of the gap in the window - it was too cold to open it all the way. Every time he reached up, his t-shirt rode up almost to his belly button, displaying soft skin and a line of fine dark hair.\n\n\nRemus lay on the couch, a cold flannel on his forehead, watching Sirius inhale, stretch, puff. Lovely, lovely creature. How had Remus ever got so lucky?\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bloody mental, sending you on your own. Why can\u2019t I go with you? I could go as Padfoot.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus sighed, \u201cYou still smell human. They\u2019d tear you apart.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat if they tear\n\n\nyou\n\n\napart?\u201d Sirius turned sharply. He looked distraught, his cheeks were pink, which was incredible for he-of-the-porcelain-complexion.\n\n\n\u201cMe?\u201d Remus snorted, trying to sound careless, \u201cGreyback\u2019s prodigal son? Not likely.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a prodigal son?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh right, er\u2026 just means I\u2019m going to get a warm welcome. Gaius said not to hurt me. Livia called me her brother.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCould I come with you for a bit? Just before anyone else shows up?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not safe, Padfoot.\u201d Remus said, gently.\n\n\nSirius stubbed out his cigarette angrily on the windowsill. Remus wished he\u2019d stop doing that - they would need to repaint it soon - but now was not the time to scold him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to the Potters\u2019?\u201d He suggested, \u201cDon\u2019t spend the night here by yourself.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care where I spend the night.\u201d Sirius flung himself into the armchair.\n\n\n\u201cWell I do,\u201d Remus tutted, \u201cI need to know where to go after the moon\u2019s down.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShit, yeah,\u201d Sirius sat up, sweeping his hair back, \u201cOk, I\u2019ll go to the Potters - then if you need any patching up Euphemia will be on hand. Fuck, what if you can\u2019t apparate? What if you--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll send a patronus.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut if you\u2019re not strong enough\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI will be.\u201d Remus replied simply. He was going to an enchanted forest, based on the co-ordinates Moody had sent. If there was even half the magic there that there was in the Forbidden Forest, then Remus foresaw no problem getting himself out. Unless someone with equal strength tried to stop him, but he was trying not to think about that.\n\n\nA faint chiming sound echoed through the walls. They hadn\u2019t met their neighbours properly - only waved shy \u2018hellos\u2019 in the hall - but they knew they had a grandfather clock, because it went off every hour and was so loud they could hear it in their living room. It was four o\u2019clock, and the depths of winter, which meant sundown was imminent.\n\n\nRemus sat up slowly, tossing aside the flannel. His back ached, early pangs telling him the moon was on its way.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d better get going,\u201d he said.\n\n\nSirius stared at him, stricken. Remus tutted, getting up. He went over and kissed Sirius\u2019s forehead. \u201cGo to the Potters\u2019. I\u2019ll be fine. Honestly, you go on missions all the time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot like this! Defensive stuff, guard duty, carrying messages, not\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSomeone has to do it,\u201d Remus shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d rather it was me.\u201d\n\n\nHe thought of Danny again, and flinched, shaking his head to rid himself of the negative memory. It kept coming up, ever since Remus had learnt the truth about why Danny had been turned. God, the McKinnons had every reason to hate Remus.\n\n\nHe put his shoes on, tying the laces carefully, though he knew he\u2019d only have to take them off again soon. He wore muggle clothes - this had been Ferox\u2019s suggestion. The werewolves had no idea where Remus was living, or how he was living. If Remus could convince them he had been shunned by the wizarding world, then all the better.\n\n\nThey hugged at the door, Remus\u2019s skin already burning up, Sirius clinging to him so tightly Remus thought he\u2019d have to take him after all.\n\n\n\u201cI love you.\u201d Sirius said into his shoulder. They hadn\u2019t said it since Hope\u2019s funeral, but Remus had no trouble at all responding instantly,\n\n\n\u201cI love you too. I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll see you so soon, I promise.\u201d\n\n\nAnd then he left, and he apparated, and when Remus opened his eyes he was very much alone.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nHe was somewhere in Derbyshire. At least he thought so. It was rapidly growing dark, and the thick forest canopy made it darker still. The night air was very cold and clean, but Remus was already too warm, and began to strip down at once. He was alone, after all, there was no need to be shy. Except he was not alone; not completely. This was definitely a magical forest, he could taste it on the breeze, hear it in the rustling of the wintry tree branches.\n\n\nThe moon began to rise and Remus felt his body start to change. He braced himself against an oak, clawing at the bark with his nails, toes curling in the mouldy leaf litter.\n\n\nThe trees seemed to empathise. The earth rose up to meet him, damp ground cooling his feverish skin, owls and foxes and bats and all the nocturnal creatures of the woodland crying out as he screamed and his skin burst open and his bones cracked and his teeth sharpened, until he was no longer Remus, and he howled along with them.\n\n\n\nThe wolf snarled, whipping its tail. It did not know where it was, or why it was alone. Where were the others? Where was the black one? It sniffed the air, sensing something nearby. It threw back its head and howled once more, singing to the moon.\n\n\n\n\nFor the first time in its life, the wolf did not sing alone. A cacophony of beautiful voices joined in, answering, and he ran towards them at full pelt. With every beat of its wolfish heart it panted;\n\n\n\nhome, home home. I am home.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nSunday 14th January 1979\n\n\nCoughing and spluttering, Remus returned to his senses. He came back piece by piece, confused and sore and exhausted. He opened his eyes and squinted at the cold yellow morning sun flashing at him through bare branches. All around him, the sounds of others waking up, some broken sobs, rough gasps, and female laughter. Their scent was so delicious, so safe and so comforting.\n\n\nRemus propped himself up on his elbows, dead leaves sticking to his mushroom-clammy skin. He had a long claw mark along his right thigh, three stripes oozing blood. Around him, six or seven others lay naked on the forest floor, slowly coming awake.\n\n\n\u201cBrother!\u201d A familiar cackle sounded out.\n\n\nRemus twisted around to see Livia crawling towards him on all fours, her hips swaying, a deranged grin on her face. In the daylight her tattoos looked like animal markings; they covered every inch of her scrawny body in great sweeping spirals, \u201cI knew you would come!\u201d\n\n\nShe knelt at his feet, and he tried to draw his knees up away from her, but she shot out a hand and grabbed his ankle. \u201cYou were beautiful, Remus Lupin, beautiful,\u201d she purred, leaning forward, her hand moving up his leg,\n\n\n\u201cGet off me, Livia,\u201d he growled, trying to kick at her - but she held him fast.\n\n\n\u201cShhh,\u201d She said playfully, leaning over even further, her hand moving ever closer, \u201cJust relax my love, my darling brother\u2026\u201d\n\n\nShe stretched out her hand and ran three splayed fingers down the cuts on his leg. It felt weird. His whole body seemed to tingle and quiver, he felt warm and - worryingly - on the verge of arousal. He did pull away then, scuttling backwards on all fours like a crab. Livia laughed at him, holding up her three bloody fingertips, then sucking them into her mouth one by one, grinning and murmuring with pleasure.\n\n\nDisturbed, he stood up quickly, finding that whatever Livia had done, it had healed the wound. He was left only with a silvery scar.\n\n\nThe others were up too, and closing in on him, walking towards Remus through the trees, eyes burning with curiosity, sniffing at the air. Some of them were cut or scratched, but they each healed each other, just by touching and channeling the natural magic which surrounded them. Many of them had shaved heads and the beginnings of the same tattoos Livia had. Others were perhaps more recent initiants, and had longer hair, clear skin.\n\n\nRemus wanted to summon his clothes, and ideally his wand too, but it seemed a bit rude when everyone else was starkers too. Besides, he wasn\u2019t cold, at least not yet. He wasn\u2019t frightened, either, which seemed strange. He looked around at the other faces. Still that voice deep within him said;\n\n\npack\n\n\n,\n\n\npack\n\n\n,\n\n\nhome\n\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cGaius,\u201d Livia said, suddenly, standing up. Gaius was at her side in an instant. He smiled at Remus, licking his lips,\n\n\n\u201cWelcome, brother.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWelcome, brother!\u201d The others echoed, one after the other, like a peel of bells. Remus felt a surge of adrenaline, of strong, undeniable connection.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so glad you could join us,\u201d Gaius said. Livia turned to him, and began to lick his wounds, as if it was the most natural thing in the world.\n\n\nCastor was there too, but he hung back. Since Remus had last met him, Castor had received a wound which slashed his face, a long split across the nose. It was healed over, but it ruined his once beautiful face.\n\n\nRemus remembered himself, and found his voice,\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had enough,\u201d he said, raising his chin. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of the humans, I want to see what else there is.\u201d\n\n\nGaius\u2019s grin widened, and Livia looked up too, blood on her lips and teeth.\n\n\n\u201cOur father will be so pleased,\u201d they said in unison,\n\n\n\u201cSo pleased!\u201d Repeated the group.\n\n\n\u201cI want to meet him,\u201d Remus said, \u201cWill you tell him that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIn time, Remus Lupin.\u201d Livia and Gaius said.\n\n\n\u201cIn time\u2026\u201d\n\n\nSomething was happening, though, the pack was retreating. They walked away, back into the trees, the brush, fading into the landscape like the predators they were. Remus felt a tug in his chest. He wanted to follow them; he didn\u2019t want to lose their company yet.\n\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d He asked Livia, as she too began to back away.\n\n\n\u201cWe will see you next month, Remus Lupin,\u201d she said, her face softening somewhat - she looked almost kind, if you ignored the blood drying in the corners of her mouth, \u201cIt is not long to wait.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut I\u2026\u201d\n\n\nThey both turned, and did not look back.\n\n\nNow Remus started feeling cold. The chill seemed to begin inside him and work its way out. He felt a horrible empty loneliness that hadn\u2019t been there before. Their scent was gone, their familiarity, the safety they represented.\n\n\nJesus Christ, Moony\n\n\n, he hissed at himself,\n\n\nSort yourself out, you\u2019re not\n\n\n\nreally\n\n\n\none of them!\n\n\n\nHe summoned his clothes quickly, and held his wand tight. It felt weird; somehow vestigial. Much easier to simply summon the strength in his own body, at his very fingertips, no need for a silly stick. He frowned. He did not feel himself. Best to apparate back to the Potters\u2019 quickly, before he turned completely feral.\n\n\nHe apparated to the back door, and knocked weakly on the glass of the french windows. He felt much more tired by then; perhaps the effort of apparition, or just being away from the forest and back in mundanity. Mrs Potter was already in the kitchen, and came over at once, opening the doors.\n\n\nShe beamed at him with creased and wrinkled eyes,\n\n\n\u201cRemus, dear,\u201d she said, her voice very quiet - the others must still be sleeping. \u201cI\u2019d better ask you something\u2026 let me see\u2026 oh, I\u2019m no good at this\u2026 ah; where did you and the boys go on holiday before your seventh year?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCornwall,\u201d Remus replied promptly, grateful to be reminded of that wonderful summer, \u201cNear Truro.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLovely,\u201d she opened the door. \u201cNow, are you all right? Anything hurt?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d he said, stepping into the kitchen, extending his arms as if to prove his good health to her. Oh god, now he was in the house he could smell Sirius, and everything in him wanted to seek him out at once.\n\n\n\u201cLovely,\u201d Mrs Potter smiled, tiredly. \u201cWell then, I think I\u2019ll go back to bed, it\u2019s hours until breakfast. The boys are sleeping, Sirius is in his room, but if you wanted a bit of peace and quiet I\u2019ve made up the spare bed too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks, Mrs Potter!\u201d Remus said, practically running up the stairs to the bedroom Sirius was in. He remembered himself just before slamming the door open, and instead pushed it gently, peering inside.\n\n\nIt was quite dark, the heavy curtains drawn over the early sunrise. \u201cAre you awake?\u201d he whispered - redundantly, because he knew that he was.\n\n\n\u201cMoony!\u201d Sirius sat up immediately.\n\n\nRemus hurried over to the bed, hanging back at the last moment, because no, he wasn\u2019t a wolf now; he was human and he had to act it.\n\n\n\u201cAre you ok?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he nodded emphatically, \u201cIt was fine, it was nothing. We just hunted.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHunted?!\u201d Sirius\u2019s eyes widened.\n\n\n\u201cRabbits.\u201d Remus clarified. He could still taste the gamey flesh between his teeth. His stomach flipped and he grew warm once more, \u201cHonestly, it was fine. Easy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was so worried about you, I didn\u2019t even sleep\u2026 don\u2019t you want to get in?\u201d He pulled back the covers.\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Remus shifted, still standing, \u201cI\u2019m a bit\u2026 on edge.\u201d\n\n\nSirius frowned, confused. Remus cleared his throat,\n\n\n\u201cYou know. Like the other day?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Sirius reached out and touched Remus\u2019s arm lightly. He bit his lip, shivering delightfully, getting a taste of the same feeling. \u201cSo you are. Um\u2026\u201d\n\n\nHe reached out and put his hands on Remus\u2019s hips, curling his fingers in under the waistband of his jeans, Sirius tugged him towards him, \u201cThat's ok, I can sleep later\u2026\u201d\n\n\nThey did sleep later, both of them, and thankfully James and Lily and the Potters left them undisturbed. When they woke up at five o\u2019clock in the evening, Remus felt like the worst guest in the world, though of course Sirius was perfectly at home.\n\n\nRemus tried to explain the night\u2019s events to Sirius, but there were things he couldn\u2019t help glossing over. Livia healing him in that intimate way. The desire he\u2019d had to stay, to follow them. It wasn\u2019t lying. He was being as honest as he thought was safe.\n\n\nLater, he told Moody and Ferox an even more censored version. They didn\u2019t ask for much detail, to be fair, and Remus didn\u2019t see why he should give them everything. He was keen to keep the other werewolves\u2019 identities private for as long as he realistically could, and for now they were only interested in Greyback.\n\n\nAs for Remus, he was the closest he had ever been to the thing he had wanted ever since he was a child. He was going to meet the man who destroyed his life. And he was going to kill him.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nSunday 11th February 1979\n\n\nSecond Moon\n\n\n\nIn the intervening month, Remus tried to retain a semblance of normality. He attended meetings and met his friends - often he would go and see the girls on their lunch break; Lily and Marlene at St Mungo\u2019s, Mary only a short bus trip away in Kensington. He phoned Grant if Sirius was away and he got lonely, and he listened to records and he read books.\n\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t ignore how different he felt. Sometimes it caught him off guard; a memory would come to him, or a scent, and his toes curled and he licked his teeth. His dreams became almost exclusively about forests and howling and cool soft moonlight.\n\n\nHe was better prepared, the second time. Just as nervous, though. He apparated to the same spot as before, in case they came to meet him - but they didn\u2019t and he transformed alone.\n\n\n\nThe wolf found its pack even faster this time. They keened and yapped in greeting, the alpha bitch nipped his ear and rubbed herself against him, the younger wolves ducked their heads in submission. Then the hunt began. The wolf could not remember ever having felt such uncomplicated joy before, even with its other pack. The rage and the fear and the hunger slipped away with the wind in its fur, the scent of the herd they stalked.\n\n\n\n\nWhen they finally caught up to the deer, Remus, Gaius, Livia and Castor were the first in; they took down the stag. The others followed suit, closing in on the struggling beast. The wolf leapt and dug in its claws, relishing the panicked heartbeat of its prey. It sank in its teeth and tore away flesh, and hot rich blood slid down its throat.\n\n\n\nWhen Remus woke up, he was not hungry.\n\n\nHe allowed Livia to lick his wounds clean this time, too dopey and satisfied to think too hard about any of the implications.\n\n\n\u201cWill I meet Greyback next month?\u201d He asked, before Castor and Livia could melt back into the shadows.\n\n\n\u201cOur father is looking forward to meeting you Remus Lupin,\u201d Livia said, \u201cYou must be a little more patient, my brother.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHave I proved myself?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is not for us to decide.\u201d\n\n\nHe stayed in the forest longer than usual - perhaps just out of laziness. Even alone, he felt better there than he had anywhere else. He would have liked to curl up and sleep beneath the trees. When Remus finally reappeared outside the Potters\u2019 back door, it was the middle of breakfast.\n\n\nLily, James and Sirius were there, faces anxious and drawn, nursing large cups of milky tea. Mrs Potter was standing at the window peering out, and jumped when Remus arrived. She swung the door open.\n\n\n\u201cThere you are!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he murmured, a bit wobbly on his feet.\n\n\n\u201cOh my god, Moony, are you ok?!\u201d Lily was at the door now too, and she pointed at him, horrified. He looked down and saw the blood - it had trickled down his chin and neck, pooling in the hollow above his collar bones, and dried there without his even noticing.\n\n\n\u201cShit,\u201d he rubbed at his mouth self consciously, \u201cIt\u2019s not mine, it\u2019s not--\u201d\n\n\nJames came to the door next, and Remus suddenly felt very queasy, covered in stag\u2019s blood, having feasted on deer only hours before. He stuck out an arm to lean against the wall, giddily.\n\n\n\u201cCome on, Moony,\u201d Sirius ducked between James and Lily and touched Remus\u2019s hand lightly, \u201cLet\u2019s get you cleaned up\u2026\u201d\n\n\nGratefully, Remus allowed himself to be led upstairs to the bathroom. Sirius ran a warm bath, and then stood leaning against the sink while Remus soaked himself, blinking dazedly at the rust coloured swirls in the warm water.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not human,\u201d he said, shakily.\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cIt\u2019s deer, I can smell it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou can?\u201d Remus looked up at him. Sirius wrinkled his nose,\n\n\n\u201cI have to concentrate, but yeah. I was talking to Prongs about it, the longer we\u2019re animagi the more weird things we notice. Hope I don\u2019t go colour blind next, eh?\u201d\n\n\nRemus tried to laugh at this attempt to alleviate the tension, but he was too shaken up.\n\n\n\u201cWas it bad?\u201d Sirius asked, gently, lowering his voice as if Remus was an invalid.\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n, Remus thought to himself.\n\n\nIt was wonderful. I was happy; I was normal.\n\n\nHe was disgusted with himself.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s happening to me?\n\n\n\nHe looked at Sirius and nodded. \u201cYeah. It was bad.\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nTuesday 13th March 1979\n\n\nThird Moon\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to the Potters\u2019 this time.\u201d Remus said, before he had to leave for the third moon with the pack.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sirius came out of the kitchen, where he\u2019d been doing the washing up. He was becoming steadily more house proud - or maybe it was just nervous energy; the war was hotting up for everyone, not just Remus.\n\n\nHe was wearing a pair of bright yellow marigolds, which Remus had bought him as a joke, but he loved so much he wore every time. They were wet and shining, dripping suds on the carpet.\n\n\n\u201cI said I don\u2019t want to go back to the Potters\u2019.\u201d Remus repeated, \u201cIn the morning. You can stay there, obviously, but I\u2026 I just won\u2019t, ok? I don\u2019t know how safe it is, I don\u2019t want anyone to follow me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been fine so far\u2026\u201d\n\n\nSirius had been doing that a lot; saying \u2018we\u2019 when it was really only about Remus.\n\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve been careless.\u201d Remus shrugged. \u201cI won\u2019t put them in danger again.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk.\u201d Sirius nodded. He peeled off the gloves slowly, \u201cWhere do you want to go, then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I thought maybe Cornwall? That castle ruin we visited, do you remember?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course I remember. Shall I meet you there?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWait for my signal. I want it to be safe.\u201d Remus shifted from foot to foot. He wanted to pace; his back was aching again and he needed to go soon, but he kept still in case it worried Sirius.\n\n\n\u201cMoony, if it\u2019s not safe then I\u2019d\n\n\nrather\n\n\nbe there so I can help. I know Prongs and Wormtail and Evans will too--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus raised his voice. \u201cNo, please.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut Moony---\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLook, I have to go.\u201d He practically flew out of the door; he didn\u2019t even put his coat on.\n\n\nHe hadn\u2019t said a proper goodbye. He hadn\u2019t even said \u2018I love you\u2019, which they had been doing every time they were separated, just in case. But of course Remus thought he was coming back. He couldn\u2019t have known what the pack had planned.\n\n* * *\n\n\nThis time it was a relief to shed his human form and give up responsibility for a few hours. They ran and played and fought and howled through the night, rustling fairies up from the underbrush, following scents they picked up.\n\n\n\n\nAs the moon began to fade, the wolf slowed down, started to whimper as it felt its body shrinking back to pathetic human form. The others stopped too, and drew in close.\n\n\n\nLivia was the first to pounce, and Remus, half wolf, half man by this point, tried to struggle but she held him fast, her paws becoming claw-like hands. Castor and Gaius had him too, pinning him down as Remus groaned and clenched his teeth through the pains of transformation.\n\n\nAnd then he was human once more, pressed into the ground by the pack, braced against their tangle of strong, hot limbs. He raised his head, yelling,\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?! Let me go!\u201d\n\n\nLivia laughed, astride him, throwing her head back, and then it happened. That weird sucking, squeezing sensation as all four of them apparated, Remus helpless to do anything but cling on and pray he didn\u2019t get splinched.\n\n\nSuddenly the ground beneath him was hard, cold stone, rocks digging into his bare back. The others finally got off him, and he scrambled to his feet, staring around wildly. They were indoors, in a high ceilinged chamber, like a - was it a\n\n\nchurch\n\n\n?! It was cold, and it reeked of the pack, and ancient magic. The others stood around him, smiling madly.\n\n\n\u201cWhere the fuck am--\u201d Remus started, but stopped short as Livia stepped to one side and a tall, dark figure approached. Remus knew that scent, he knew those burning yellow eyes. He froze, paralysed by terror. Greyback stepped towards him, teeth bared in a cruel smile.\n\n\n\u201cWelcome home, cub.\u201d"

For now, he had nothing to say. He just wanted to get a good look.\n\n\nFenrir Greyback. Remus had expected him to be taller. He wasn\u2019t short by any standards, but when Remus stood up straight they were eye level. That was good. That gave him a flutter of courage.\n\n\nHe may not be taller than Remus, but Greyback was certainly bigger in every other way; hulking broad shoulders, thick squat neck, muscular arms. He had long, thick yellow fingernails, dark wiry hair covering his forearms and sprouting up over the collar of his cloak, meeting a dark beard that was more like fur than hair. His eyes were dangerous, inhuman.\n\n\nThe magic radiating off him was not like a wizard\u2019s; at least not any Remus had encountered. Like a full moon, it was searing. The scent, while sickeningly familiar, was not inviting.\n\n\nRemus had felt at home with the pack; he had felt he belonged. But not with this man. He was the enemy, and always would be.\n\n\n\u201cLike what you see?\u201d Greyback\u2019s smile widened, showing sharp, predatory teeth, long yellow canines.\n\n\nRemus stared impassively back, mouth shut.\n\n\nHe realised that Greyback did not like it. Greyback had expected him to speak - to beg, or to rage, or even panic. And Remus knew exactly what to do with bullies who wanted a reaction.\n\n\nHe cocked his head, pulled a nonchalant face and shrugged.\n\n\n\u201cS\u2019ok, I s\u2019pose. Oi, could I get my clothes back?\u201d\n\n\nGreyback\u2019s pupils seemed to dilate, or maybe Remus just imagined it. Either way, he recovered quickly, still smiling stiffly.\n\n\n\u201cWhere are my manners? Castor!\u201d He snapped his claw-like fingers.\n\n\nCastor appeared at Greyback\u2019s side in a moment, straight-backed and wrapped in a fur cloak, carrying a bundle of clothes. Livia was there too, gazing adoringly at her father. The old church they stood in had no ceiling, and in the rosey dawn light Remus could clearly see Castor\u2019s face for the first time. There were three long pink scars down one side; claw marks, pink and soft as burnt skin.\n\n\nGreyback saw him staring.\n\n\n\u201cShame about that,\u201d He said said, reaching out and stroking Castor\u2019s cheek with one filthy fingernail. Castor did not flinch. \u201cHated to ruin something so pleasant to look at, but he\u2019s learnt his lesson, haven\u2019t you, cub?\u201d\n\n\nCastor nodded, staring straight ahead like a soldier.\n\n\n\u201cGood boy.\u201d Greyback stroked his scarred cheek. \u201cStill beautiful though, eh Remus?\u201d\n\n\nRemus said nothing, and looked away, disgusted.\n\n\n\u201cAnd I thought you were a connoisseur of beauty.\u201d Greyback tutted with mock-disappointment. \u201cThat\u2019s why I sent you my loveliest children.\u201d\n\n\nLivia gave a shiver of pleasure at that, tossing her head proudly.\n\n\nCastor held out Remus\u2019s clothes, and he took them, dressing carefully. He felt in his jeans pocket for his wand, but it wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Greyback growled, \u201cLooking for this?\u201d\n\n\nHe withdrew the long thin stick from his own mud-spattered robes. Remus felt a horrible twist of longing for it. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t allow these foolish human toys.\u201d Greyback smirked. He took Remus\u2019s wand in both hands and snapped it clean it two.\n\n\nRemus had to struggle not to cry out. That had been\n\n\nLyall\u2019s\n\n\nwand. In fact, it had been the only thing Lyall had ever given Remus that wasn\u2019t completely worthless. He bit the inside of his cheek, hard.\n\n\nGreyback handed the wand fragments to Livia, who twiddled them gleefully between her fingers like batons. Remus raised his chin, defiantly,\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI want what I have always wanted, cub,\u201d Greyback stepped closer, so that Remus could smell his sour breath, their noses only inches apart, \u201cI want to take care of you.\u201d\n\n\nHe reached out to place a hand on Remus\u2019s shoulder, and it took every ounce of Remus\u2019s will not to flinch, or duck away. Greyback\u2019s long fingers squeezed him in a fatherly manner - but a bit too close to his throat for comfort.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to join you,\u201d Remus breathed, struggling to hold his nerve.\n\n\nGreyback tilted back his head and laughed. It was a gruff, wheezing laugh from deep inside his chest.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what my children tell me.\n\n\nRemus Lupin has joined us,\n\n\nthey say,\n\n\nhe has cast off the human world\u2026\n\n\nBut I wonder...\u201d He licked his lips, looking Remus up and down lasciviously, \u201cI wonder if Remus Lupin has truly changed his ways\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here, aren\u2019t I?\u201d Remus protested, \u201cI\u2019ve spent three moons with--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd where were you between the moons?\u201d Greyback challenged. He sniffed the air between them. \u201cYou reek of humankind.\u201d\n\n\nWith that, he released Remus\u2019s shoulder, pushing him backwards, hard. Remus hit the stone floor with a thump, and a gasp of surprise and pain as his back jarred. Greyback walked away, his pack dividing to let him through.\n\n\n\u201cCastor, Livia,\u201d he snarled, \u201cLook after our guest. See if we can\u2019t wring some of that humanity out of him.\u201d\n\n\nRemus climbed to his feet stiffly, and went to chase after Greyback, but Livia and Gaius blocked him with their bodies. Over their shoulders, he watched Greyback leave the church through an open archway, and disappear into the bright green foliage beyond.\n\n\nAlone and wandless, Remus backed away from the others warily. He wondered if he could apparate, but he didn\u2019t dare - and after all, surely this was the mission? He had achieved what he\u2019d set out to; he was in Greyback\u2019s pack. Pushing any thought of home or his friends aside, Remus faced his captors. Now was the time to be brave.\n\n\nLivia approached him first, tossing his splintered wand parts away and grabbing his arms, twisting them hard behind his back. Castor came next, same stoic expression on his face. He was unwinding a length of rope, holding it out.\n\n\n\u201cOi!\u201d Remus struggled against Livia, \u201cPiss off, you\u2019re not tying me up!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is not for long, brother,\u201d Livia hissed in his ear. \u201cIt is necessary.\u201d Then she\n\n\nlicked\n\n\nhim - she ran her long tongue up from the nape of his neck almost to his hairline. He shuddered in disgust, struggling harder, but she only laughed - she was so strong.\n\n\nThey bound him tightly, then forced him forwards, Castor leading, tugging on the rope around Remus\u2019s arms and body; Livia pushing from behind.\n\n\nHe stumbled awkwardly through the church, still unsteady on his feet, having only just transformed.\n\n\nHe was shoved towards what must once have been the altar. Behind that was an old arched ambulatory, and beneath those shadows a set of steps leading down into a grave-like cellar. They began to descend, the strong smell of damp earth rising.\n\n\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Remus tried asking.\n\n\n\u201cWe are home.\u201d Castor replied, without looking back.\n\n\nLivia gave him a rough jab in the back, and he didn\u2019t ask any more questions.\n\n\nThey reached the bottom of the stairs, which opened out into a crypt, the vaulted ceiling only just tall enough for Remus to stand straight.\n\n\nThere was not much there. A weird, milky light filled the room but appeared to have no natural source. There were gated chambers either side of the walls, once for tombs, Remus assumed, but now emptied. They had been replaced by blankets, old stained pillows and animal furs.\n\n\nRemus blinked hard, his eyes adjusting to the light, and before he could get his bearings was thrown forward into one of the cells. Livia growled some incantation and the wrought iron bars slammed closed across it, the heavy black chains coiling tight over the lock.\n\n\n\u201cOi!\u201d Remus threw himself wildly against the bars, \u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSit.\u201d Livia barked. Remus\u2019s legs folded beneath him and he was down. She smiled at him. \u201cRest, brother. Patience.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI came here to join you, you can\u2019t treat me like --\"\n\n\n\u201cDo\n\n\nnot\n\n\nmake me silence you.\u201d She hissed.\n\n\nHe shut his mouth - voluntarily. Perhaps it would be better to wait and see, for now. Livia licked her lips. \u201cTry to rest.\u201d\n\n\nShe stalked away. Castor was left behind, staring at Remus, face inscrutable, body still rigid. Remus stared back. His poor face. Had that been because of Remus? Had he been punished for that last time in the Forbidden Forest? His dark eyes bore into Remus for a long time, unflinching, until Remus scowled at him,\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs Remus Lupin truly here to join the pack? To submit himself to our father?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you think?!\u201d Remus jutted out his chin, though he knew he hardly looked dignified, sitting on the filthy floor with his arms bound against his body.\n\n\n\u201cI think\u2026\u201d Castor inclined his head slightly, as though nobody had ever asked him about his own thoughts before. \u201c...I think that Remus Lupin does not yet know what he will do.\u201d\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t have a response for that. Obviously he\u2019d like to think that was not true, that his will was iron, unbreakable. But just now, trapped and unarmed and exhausted, he couldn\u2019t muster up much pride.\n\n\nCastor didn\u2019t seem to mind. He just nodded very slightly, and then backed away, into the room. \u201cRest, Remus lupin.\u201d He said, before turning his back.\n\n\nThe crypt was filling up now, the other werewolves were arriving, saturating the room with their scent and their energy. Remus backed into a corner, knees up to his chest, and watched them from the shadows. Their ages only varied slightly - Remus didn\u2019t think any of them were older than thirty. In various states of undress, he could see that all of them were thin and scarred, and some tattooed. None of them were particularly clean.\n\n\nStill, as they all settled in, apparently to sleep off the events of the full moon, Remus couldn\u2019t help but feel some sense of security and warmth. He was still getting used to being surrounded by his own kind, and the urge to settle down and make himself comfortable as they were all doing was strong. As if their hearts were all beating as one; they were all part of the same body, and now was the time for sleep.\n\n\nLivia was nowhere to be seen, nor Greyback, and Remus took some comfort from this. The dark chamber grew warm, and as the pack settled in quietly, murmuring and whispering amongst themselves as they bedded down, Remus\u2019s eyelids grey heavy and his limbs soft, and eventually the exhaustion caught up with him and he drifted away.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere are you, you filthy little beast?!\u201d Matron\u2019s nasal voice screeched as she stalked up and down the echoey hallways, high heels clicking like a predator. \u201cWhen I get my hands on you I\u2019m going to wallop you into next week!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nRemus curled up even tighter in his hiding place, covering his ears with his hands and squeezing his eyes shut. She\u2019d never find him; he was too good at hiding, and very very small.\n\n\n\n\nHe was underneath one of the big boys\u2019 beds. He knew he wasn\u2019t supposed to be in their dorm, he\u2019d get beaten up if one of them found him; but he knew how to keep quiet. He\u2019d learnt that in the first few days at St Edmund\u2019s, and now he\u2019d been there for some time he hardly ever got picked on unless he\u2019d really got in someone\u2019s way.\n\n\n\n\nRemus didn't feel very well. He was starting to hurt all over, and his skin was all hot and prickly.\n\n\n\n\nHe wanted his mummy, but he didn\u2019t know where she was anymore. Maybe she\u2019d gone somewhere with Daddy, and they\u2019d come and get him soon. Maybe they were hunting down the bad man who hurt him.\n\n\n\n\nRemus pinched himself, hard. He didn\u2019t want to think about the scary man. He couldn\u2019t remember very much of it, except when he was really frightened. Pinching helped, except now the hurting all over was getting even worse. The bones in his legs stung, and he desperately wanted to stretch them out, but then someone might see him.\n\n\n\n\nFinally it was too much, and another wave of pain forced him to uncurl, letting out a cry.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOwww\u2026.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAh ha!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nOh no. Matron. Suddenly there was a hand around his ankle, and she yanked him hard out from under the bed.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere you are you little monster! Come with me, you know you\u2019ve got to go to your room.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d he moaned, as she hoisted him up and carried him under one arm. Not the room. He\n\n\n\nhated\n\n\n\nhis room; it was so scary. \u201cLet me go!\u201d He beat his fists against her, but she barely reacted, marching down the corridor, down the stairs and towards his cell.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLet me go!\u201d He screamed, crying now, snot and tears running down his face, \u201cI want my mummy! I want my mummy!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not here.\u201d Matron snapped. She opened the door and set him down inside, slamming it shut hard in his face. He heard the bolts go and began to cry harder.\n\n\n\n\nIt was so dark.\n\n\n\n\nHe was scared of the dark, ever since the bad man, and Mummy always let him have the hallway light on. But Matron wasn\u2019t like Mummy; she never did nice things, only horrible things, because he\u2019d been so bad. Was he here because he was bad? Was that why Mummy didn\u2019t want him, and Daddy went away?\n\n\n\n\nHe sobbed and screamed, but nobody came. It was too scary, and too dark, and it hurt, it hurt it hurt\u2026. A horrible growling filled his head, and suddenly Remus remembered why he didn\u2019t feel well, and why he had to be locked in his room.\n\n\n\n\nRemus awoke with a start. His face was wet with tears, and he was sweating all over. It took him long seconds to remember that he was nineteen, not six, and not locked in his cell at St Edmund\u2019s.\n\n\nHe hadn\u2019t thought about the Home for a long time - and he tried never to re-hash\n\n\nthose\n\n\nmemories. His heart pounded in his ears, adrenaline coursed through him and he struggled to get his emotions back under control.\n\n\nHe was being watched. It was Jeremy - the young man Gaius had been recruiting back in the Manticore\u2019s head. He was leaning against the bars, peering at Remus,\n\n\n\u201cBad dream?\u201d He asked, his voice rasping, as though he was getting over a bad cold. He was thinner than Remus remembered.\n\n\nRemus straightened up quickly, reaching up to wipe his face with the back of his sleeves, finding that the ropes had mysteriously vanished. Had someone come in and untied him? Had Livia done it somehow?\n\n\nThe room behind Jeremy was empty, now; it was just the two of them.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d Jeremy said, conversationally, \u201cI had bad dreams too, when I first got here. We all do. They tell us it\u2019s all of the old stuff coming to the surface; the memories we don\u2019t need. Once they\u2019re gone, we can start our new lives with the pack.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWere you all locked up like this?\u201d Remus asked, his throat sore. He was thirsty, but he didn\u2019t want to look weak.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Jeremy shrugged. \u201cJust you. They\u2019re worried about you. After what you pulled back in the pub. And there are other stories. They talk about you sometimes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho does? Livia? Castor? Greyback??\u201d\n\n\nJeremy shrugged again, apathetic.\n\n\n\u201cYeah. That lot. They\u2019re in charge. Livia\u2019s first, because she was turned by Greyback. You get better stuff, if you\u2019re a direct descendent.\u201d\n\n\nRemus snorted. He wondered if Jeremy knew that he had been turned by Greyback too, and whether or not being tied up and thrown in a cell counted as \u2018better stuff\u2019.\n\n\nJeremy began to cough, a deep, chesty crackle, which wracked his body and doubled him over. He pulled his fur cloak tighter around his skinny frame, and Remus finally felt something beyond fear or anger. He felt sympathy.\n\n\n\u201cDo you all live here, in this place?\u201d He asked, softly, looking around at the dank cellar. \u201cBetween the moons?\u201d\n\n\nJeremy nodded.\n\n\n\u201cBetter than where I was before.\u201d He said. Then, as if bored with the conversation, he simply stepped away. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d he said blandly. \u201cI\u2019ll tell someone you\u2019re awake. See you.\u201d\n\n\nAnd Remus was alone again. He climbed to his feet, carefully, checking that nothing was broken or sprained or too sore. No, he actually felt better than he usually did, after a moon - even with Madam Pomfrey\u2019s care. If only he wasn\u2019t trapped. If only they hadn\u2019t destroyed his wand. He reached into his jeans and found that they\u2019d left him with his pocket watch, at least.\n\n\nRemus held the heavy metal object in his hand, letting it grow warm against his skin. He thought about Sirius - though he knew he ought not to; he didn\u2019t know who was listening in on his thoughts, and even if nobody was; Sirius was a weakness.\n\n\nWas he worried? He must be, Remus told himself. That\u2019s what love was, surely.\n\n\nHad he gone to the castle ruin in Cornwall, where they\u2019d agreed to meet? Had he waited and waited, wondering where Remus was, what had become of him? Perhaps he\u2019d raised the alarm; told the Potters first, then got hold of Moody, or even Dumbledore. Remus didn\u2019t think either would be much help. As far as they were concerned, Remus would be in one of three situations:\n\n\nDead.\n\nCompleting his mission to infiltrate the werewolves.\n\n\nTurned double agent and\nactually\njoined the werewolves.\n\n\n\nAnd from Moody\u2019s perspective, whichever it was, Remus was best left where he was. He hoped no one had said that to Sirius.\n\n\nAlready feeling his resolve slipping. Remus forced Sirius to the back of his mind. There was nothing he could do but try his hardest to see the mission through, stay alive, and get back to him. That\n\n\nhad\n\n\nto be his focus.\n\n\nHe paced the cell a few times. It wasn\u2019t big; maybe five steps across, three deep. The animal pelts it had been lined with were deer and bear, and something else Remus didn't recognise. Not wolf. Not anything native to Britain. He touched the bars; they felt weirdly warm and seemed to hum against his skin. Magic.\n\n\nHaving a sudden brainwave, Remus stepped back and closed his eyes. He was a bit stiff and still foggy from sleep, but the magic was there, in the room. Leftover from the pack, and from Livia\u2019s binding spells. He tried to gather some of it into himself. It was very difficult, without a wand, and with his nerves so shaken.\n\n\nHe pulled and tugged at the atmosphere around him, but it was like trying to smoke an unlit cigarette. Nothing came through, and he just got out of breath. The magic seemed just beyond his grasp.\n\n\n\u201cAdmirable efforts, dearest.\u201d\n\n\nRemus opened his eyes and jumped, seeing Livia now standing in the middle of the room. She grinned at his discomfort, and gestured to Jeremy, who was coming down the steps behind her, holding a large pewter jug and a plate with some food on it. Bread and meat - it smelled like rabbit, and Remus hoped it was. He began to salivate almost at once.\n\n\nLivia snapped her fingers, and the jug and plate left Jeremy\u2019s hands and appeared on the floor of Remus\u2019s cell with a *pop*. So, he thought. You could transport things through the bars. That meant he could get out of them, if he tried hard enough.\n\n\n\u201cEat up, my darling,\u201d Livia purred. \u201cFather wishes us to be strong.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Remus said. He made eye contact with her, and tried to hold it. That had worked with Gaius - and accidentally with Danny. They\u2019d submitted to him, eventually.\n\n\nLivia returned his stare and smiled, looking very pleased.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my boy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Greyback?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShow some respect.\u201d Her eyes flashed, and Remus felt a stabbing pain in his skull. He gasped, pressing a flat palm to his forehead, \u201cHe is our father.\u201d Livia hissed.\n\n\n\u201cAll right!\u201d He yelped, \u201cWhere is our\u2026 our father?\u201d It made him sick to say it.\n\n\n\u201cThat is none of your concern.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI want to speak to him!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIn time. Once you have proved yourself.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow am I supposed to prove anything locked up in here?!\u201d Remus raged, frustrated. Livia just smiled back at him.\n\n\n\u201cRemus Lupin will find a way. Goodbye, brother. Do remember to eat something.\u201d\n\n\nShe turned and stalked out, snapping her fingers at Jeremy as she did so. He scurried to follow her back up the stairs, giving one backward glance at Remus as he did, and mouthing,\n\n\n\u2018Sorry\n\n\n.\u2019\n\n\nRemus watched their feet disappear as they reached the stop of the stairs, and then heard a loud grinding noise as something heavy closed over the hatch. The strange light that had illuminated the room all this time went out, like a light switch, and Remus was left alone, locked in the dark."

You silly thing\n\n\n\n\nYou really gone and done it now\n\n\n\n\nSunday 25th March 1979\n\n\nRemus was going mad.\n\n\nThat was the only explanation.\n\n\nTime passed slowly, each second eeked out over weeks - and then hours whooshed by all at once, like missiles, knocking the breath out of him.\n\n\nThey brought him meals, and that was the only way he could measure out his days. No one spoke to him; perhaps they had been warned not to. Perhaps it was part of his proving himself. They looked, though. They stared.\n\n\nThe pack returned every night to sleep - sometimes Livia, Gaius and Castor were there. Other times not. Never Greyback, though sometimes Remus thought he could smell him - but that might have been the madness. After two days in the dark he didn\u2019t trust his senses.\n\n\nAfter a week, he trusted nothing.\n\n\nHe was never quite comfortable, always restless and exhausted; pacing until his feet were bruised. He slept little and often; caught between fitful bursts of unconsciousness and insomnia. And he had terrible dreams. Every bad memory squirmed its way up to surface of his mind. Mostly St Edmund\u2019s, but also that summer after fifth year, when he\u2019d been at his loneliest, and hated Sirius.\n\n\nHe grew paranoid, convinced that it was the others - they were controlling his mind, somehow; forcing him to see things he didn\u2019t want to see; things that weren\u2019t there.\n\n\nSometimes he dreamed Sirius was dead. Then, when that had wrung all the terror out of him, he dreamed of each of of his friends dying, one by one. Their ghosts visited him, weeping or raging. When he woke up, he never felt like they\u2019d quite gone.\n\n\nOther times Remus wondered if in fact\n\n\nhe\n\n\nwas dead, and this was some extremely specifically designed hell.\n\n\nBy the end of the first week, he had lost all sense of shame. He wept, he howled, he keened. He laughed maniacally, or else curled up in the corner and whispered to himself. He tried to have conversations in his head, but it didn\u2019t work the same way as before. Grant\u2019s calming voice transformed into Livia, Sirius into Castor, and Remus was left with no escape at all.\n\n\nIn moments of lucidity, he tried to summon more magic, but it was very hard, and he was so weak.\n\n\nSometimes he thought he could do it. One of the others might perform a spell (always wandless; none of them ever did magic the wizard way) to summon something, or illuminate the room - and Remus felt that old stirring of power. But it never lasted long enough.\n\n\nFinally, Remus\u2019s parents appeared to him - in his head, but also in the cell. Hope was crying - she was still sick, even in death, her face gaunt and haggard. She wore a white shroud, and there was earth in her fair hair - even though Remus\n\n\nknew\n\n\nshe\u2019d been cremated.\n\n\nLyall was the worst, though; maybe because Remus had no solid basis for him, beyond a few candid photographs. The Lyall his feverish imagination dreamt up was heartlessly cruel, with a plummy, upper-class accent and cold blue eyes.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet that animal destroy my wand, did you?\u201d\n\n\nThe spindly ghost whispered in his ear,\n\n\n\u201cI should have put you out of your misery, all those years ago.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile the other ghosts shamed him, made him feel small and sorry, Lyall had only ever made Remus angry. He raved like a madman at his father, and flung himself at the walls of his cage.\n\n\n\u201cPeace, brother.\u201d Castor appeared at the bars, after Remus had been doing this for some time. \u201cThis is not the way.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFuck off!\u201d Remus snarled, holding his head in his hands as he tried to ground himself in reality.\n\n\nCastor withdrew. Remus continued to suffer. He curled up on the floor and covered his head like a wounded dog. That made him think of Sirius.\n\n\nStupid thoughts occurred to him, like - where was Sirius staying? At the Potters\u2019? At their flat? Remus didn\u2019t like the idea of Sirius all alone. Was he eating properly? Was he smoking too much? Had he fallen off that stupid bike yet, and broken his neck?!\n\n\nWas anyone even\n\n\nlooking\n\n\nfor Remus?\n\n\nHe shut his eyes and tried to pretend he was somewhere else. At home in his tiny London flat, reading the paper. Or in his old bed at Hogwarts, with the curtains drawn over.\n\n\nAt night in the crypt, Remus could hear the rest of the pack breathing, snoring, rolling over. Some of them cried, maybe when they thought no one else was awake. Most of the coughed, a result of the damp conditions. After a week, Remus caught the cough too, and felt weaker than ever.\n\n\nHe\u2019d never been\n\n\nbulky\n\n\n, exactly - he\u2019d always been decidedly skinny, even after seven years of Hogwarts food. But now Remus barely recognised his own body - the bones in his hips became sharp, his drainpipe jeans slipped down his waist, his ribs stuck up like branches on a winter tree, and his skin grew dry and raw, cracking in places.\n\n\nThis physical weakness only compounded Remus\u2019s despair - who did he think he was, joining some stupid rebel army right after school? Had none of the hundreds of books he\u2019d read imbued him with any common sense?!\n\n\n\nOf course\n\n\nhe couldn\u2019t go up against Greyback - the idea was laughable. So laughable, in fact, that Greyback wasn\u2019t even going to kill him. Remus was not worth the effort. He was simply going to waste away to nothing in this cell, and nobody would ever know.\n\n\n\u201cYou are not trying.\u201d Castor said, returning to view him.\n\n\nMaybe it had only been a few hours since the first time he\u2019d tried to get through to Remus. Maybe it had been days.\n\n\nIt must have been daytime, because no one else was in the crypt.\n\n\n\u201cLet me out!\u201d Remus babbled, clutching at the bars of his cage. \u201cPlease!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLet yourself out.\u201d Castor returned, coldly.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have my wand!\u201d\n\n\nCastor tutted at him. He held out his empty palm, and a blood red flame appeared in it. It lent a soft, alluring glow to Castor\u2019s features, blurring the jagged edges of his scar and making him beautiful again.\n\n\n\u201cWe do not need wands, Remus, we do not borrow magic like common humans.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have enough.\u201d Remus groaned, slumping back.\n\n\n\u201cIdiot.\u201d Castor said, closing his hand over the flame, burning it into a fist. \u201cYou are brimming with it. You are still thinking like a human. Why do you think he put you here?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTo watch me die.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIdiot.\u201d Castor repeated, shaking his head disdainfully.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nWhy\n\n\n, then?!\u201d Remus growled.\n\n\nCastor glanced around covertly to confirm that they were alone. He came closer. His scent was stronger as he positioned himself right up against the cell bars, and Remus felt an involuntary pull of attraction towards him. Castor lowered his voice,\n\n\n\u201cYou are being tested, you fool. You are only the fourth child of Greyback to return to him - do you know what position that gives you?! What kind of power?! You\u2019ve seen Livia and Gaius, you know what you are capable of.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut why--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou attacked Gaius. Last summer. Greyback is worried about you now - he won\u2019t say it, but he is. No one challenges those two,\n\n\nno one\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to challenge anyone, he attacked me first, and I--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou acted like a wolf.\u201d Castor said, triumphantly, his soft lips curling at the corners, \u201cAnd that is what you must do now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d Remus eyed him suspiciously. Because it made a weird kind of sense, now, as if Castor had shaken him awake.\n\n\n\u201cBecause you are no good to me in this cage.\u201d Castor said, dark eyes burning with intensity. \u201cA year ago Remus Lupin spoke to me of change. Of a better life. I have not forgotten.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI seem to remember you laughing in my face.\u201d Remus returned, bitterly, \u201c\u2018The pack is everything\u2019, wasn\u2019t that what you said?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe pack\n\n\nis\n\n\neverything.\u201d Castor said, fiercely. \u201cThat has not changed. Other things have. You are not without allies, here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you want my help so badly, then\n\n\nyou\n\n\nget me out.\u201d Remus said.\n\n\nCastor raised an eyebrow, giving Remus a long hard appraising look.\n\n\n\u201cIt will be better for you if you do it yourself. The others\n\n\nmust\n\n\nsee you succeed.\u201d\n\n\nRemus was about to ask another question, when the atmosphere changed - Livia was coming. Castor backed away quickly, and said nothing more. Remus watched him from a distance, his mind finally beginning to work.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nHe needed magic. He needed power, and he needed a good strong emotion to get it all going. Luckily, Remus had always had strong emotions in abundance. That, and patience.\n\n\nBuoyed by Castor\u2019s intriguing proposition, Remus found it much easier to concentrate, and to stay calm. Now that he knew he was not entirely alone, the ghostly apparitions became easier to ignore.\n\n\nAnd he started to notice things. Like how the other werewolves were not as homogeneous as they first seemed. They were all fairly young - clearly Greyback had a preferred type; not one of them seemed older than twenty-five. They were all thin and scarred.\n\n\nBut the more Remus watched them, the more he saw their differences. Friendships and alliances; grudges and feuds, likes and dislikes.\n\n\nWhen he paid very close attention, Remus could even tell how long each of them had been werewolves - it was clear from the hierarchy. The younger set fell in two camps; fanatics who worshipped Livia and Gaius, and those who were less sure, less comfortable with this weird subterranean lifestyle. They tended to side with Castor; sleeping on one side of the crypt, talking amongst themselves.\n\n\nGaius in particular seemed troubled by this group. He stalked the crypt floor every evening, demanding quiet, ordering them to lie further apart. Remus knew from their first meeting in the Manticore\u2019s Head that Gaius had a short fuse, and as soon as Remus latched onto this idea, he knew he had to come up with a way to exploit it.\n\n\nHelp eventually came from an unexpected quarter. Jeremy, one of the very youngest members of the pack, and so far the only one who\u2019d spoken to Remus other than Castor and Livia, got bored easily. He had a mischievous side which reminded Remus of James and Sirius - he often cracked jokes to make the others laugh, and was one of the more vocal complainers when it came to living conditions.\n\n\nGaius disliked him immensely, of course, and never missed an opportunity to put him back in his place.\n\n\nOne evening, as everyone was settling down to sleep, Jeremy was struck by a particularly violent coughing fit. In Remus\u2019s opinion, he was definitely hamming it up, it went on a lot longer than was probably necessary.\n\n\n\u201cControl yourself, brother.\u201d Gaius hissed, on his feet at once, crossing the crypt to stand over Jeremy, teeth bared.\n\n\n\u201cSor-\n\n\nry\n\n\n,\u201d Jeremy spluttered, scowling sarcastically, \u201cI can\u2019t help it, it\u2019s the damp!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYour brothers and sisters seem to manage well enough.\u201d Gaius returned, bored.\n\n\nJeremy snorted. Gaius raised a hand, as if about to cast a spell.\n\n\n\u201cPerhaps you need to be reminded how to behave.\u201d\n\n\nJeremy licked his lips, nervously, and fell quiet. Castor, who had been sitting nearby, stood up. He placed a hand on Gaius\u2019s shoulder,\n\n\n\u201cI will speak to him, brother. Do not concern yourself.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOur father demands obedience.\u201d Gaius hissed. Castor\u2019s eyes flashed,\n\n\n\u201cI am well aware of our father\u2019s demands.\u201d\n\n\nGaius clearly wanted to retort, but seeing the fire in Castor\u2019s expression thought better of it and withdrew, skulking away, snapping angrily at three young women huddled together who had been watching the whole thing.\n\n\nCastor crouched and whispered to Jeremy,\n\n\n\u201cDo not provoke him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a prick! He\u2019s not Greyback, he can\u2019t order us about!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo\n\n\nnot\n\n\nprovoke him.\u201d Castor repeated, a note of warning in his voice. It was not heeded.\n\n\n\u201cI was coughing! I couldn\u2019t help it! Not as if I was whistling a jaunty tune!\u201d\n\n\nGiggling from the women nearby.\n\n\n\u201cPeace.\u201d Castor said.\n\n\nEveryone seemed to settle down after that; order and quiet were restored. Remus sat leaning against the back wall of his cell, arms hugging his knees. In one hand he clutched his pocket watch, which had grown hot and slippery from being held all the time.\n\n\nSuddenly, there was a long, low whistle. Remus\u2019s eyes snapped open, his stomach turning over.\n\n\nThat maniac\n\n\n.\n\n\nThe girls near Jeremy were giggling again as he began to whistle a little tune - Remus thought it sounded like \u2018Mary had a Little Lamb\u2019, but he wasn\u2019t good with nursery rhymes.\n\n\nIt only lasted a few bars - Gaius was on him in seconds, snarling, hands around Jeremy\u2019s throat. The young man\u2019s body went stiff as a board, and Remus could instantly smell the charcoal black magic Gaius was using to subdue him.\n\n\nIt was like a faint tingling sensation; all of the hairs on his arm stood up. Remus closed his eyes and inhaled, drinking in the magical energy as though he had been thirsting for it. The deliciousness was heightened by Gaius\u2019s terrible rage; by his flaming desire to hurt.\n\n\nThat was it. That was\n\n\nit\n\n\n! Remus was giddy with excitement as the pieces clicked into place.\n\n\n\u201cBrother,\u201d Livia\u2019s voice now. She slinked across the floor towards Gaius, languid as a cat. \u201cLeave the pup. He is restless and spirited, that is all.\u201d\n\n\nGaius released Jeremy, who collapsed back, coughing harder than before now. Remus could smell the salt from his tears. Castor knelt beside the young man, a kind hand on his shoulder.\n\n\nRemus began to think quickly. He was rubbish at whistling - he could wolf whistle (and did Sirius\n\n\nlove\n\n\nthe irony of that), but he couldn't carry a tune. What else would be annoying? He needed Gaius\u2019s attention - he needed his\n\n\nrage\n\n\n.\n\n\nHe cleared his sore throat.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nStill dunno what I was waiting for\u2026\n\n\n\u201d Remus tried, his voice a bit croaky and reedy from lack of use.\n\n\nThere was a flutter of movement, a sense of ears pricking up, as if they were waiting to see what he was up to. It was badly out of tune, too, but it was the only song he could remember all the words to.\n\n\nRemus swallowed, and raised his voice louder, standing up and approaching the bars,\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nAnd my time was running wild, a million dead end streets, and\u2026\n\n\n\u201d A bit more movement now, a few of the younger ones were sitting up, peering over at him, \u201c\n\n\nEvery time I thought I\u2019d got it made, it seemed the taste was not so sweet\u2026\n\n\n\u201d\n\n\nA few sniggers. Someone whispered, \u201cHe\u2019s finally lost it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nSo I turned myself to face me...\n\n\n\u201d Remus shut his eyes and bellowed, rolling his forehead against the cold bars, \u201c\n\n\nThough I\u2019d never caught a glimpse, of how the others must see the faker--\n\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSilence!\u201d Gaius\u2019s sharp voice rang out.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nI\u2019m much too fast to take that test\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSILENCE!\u201d\n\n\nRemus tipped his head back and took a deep breath,\n\n\n\n\u201cCH CH CHANGES! TURN AND FACE THE STRANGE CH CH CHA-ANGES!\n\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus Lupin!\u201d Gaius was up, striding towards him, one hand raised. \u201cStop this AT ONCE!\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nDON\u2019T WANNA BE A RICHER MAN\u2026\n\n\n\u201d Remus continued, feeling Gaius\u2019s fierce magical energy filling the space between them, like a tidal wave of hot air rushing over him, drenching him. He squeezed his pocket watch tighter, and drew the magic out of that, too, sucking it into his bones, his very marrow.\n\n\nRemus opened his eyes, and the bars of his cell vanished like smoke. Grinning, he stepped forward, crossing the threshold into the crypt. He was free.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nTime may change me\u2026\n\n\n\u201d he half-sang, half laughed at Gaius, who stood before him, gobsmacked,\n\n\n\u201cGet back! Livia! Castor! Help me--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up, Gaius.\u201d Remus raised his hand, barely thinking about it, just letting the magic do the work. Gaius was silenced. His mouth opened and closed a few times, eyes wide with terror. Remus felt a surge of pleasure at this.\n\n\nYes! Fear me\n\n\n. \u201cGood boy,\u201d he smirked. \u201cNow, in you pop\u2026\u201d\n\n\nHe stood aside and pushed Gaius forcefully into the cell, before snapping his fingers so that the bars reappeared at once. Gaius found his voice and roared, furious,\n\n\n\u201cLet me out!\u201d\n\n\nRemus laughed. He was about to turn, to address the rest of the pack - they were all murmuring now, various degrees of nervousness and excitement. He felt a hand on his shoulder. Livia appeared on his left, Castor to his right. They were both smiling, pride gleaming in their eyes.\n\n\n\u201cMy brother,\u201d Livia whispered, \u201cAt last! Father will be so proud.\u201d"

Or maybe it was a defence mechanism, because instinct told him what was coming next.\n\n\nEveryone in the crypt could feel it. A few of them stood up anxiously. Livia closed her eyes and sighed with pleasure.\n\n\nThe heavy, swift footsteps echoed through from the church above. Adrenaline flooded Remus\u2019s body as the concrete slab covering the entrance of the crypt was pushed aside.\n\n\nGreyback descended. He looked different from before. He was not on the defensive now. He was smiling, his posture and scent welcoming. Amiable.\n\n\nRemus\u2019s heart skipped a beat.\n\n\nGreyback smiled, his eyes dark and secretive as the forest.\n\n\n\u201cRemus Lupin,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it's time for a chat.\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded, awestruck.\n\n\nGreyback nodded too, still smiling, then turned and began to climb the stairs again. Remus followed without even glancing back. Finally, finally, this was his chance. To do what, he didn\u2019t know yet. All Remus knew in that moment was that his father had come for him, and he was elated.\n\n\nThe air grew fresher and cleaner as they surfaced in the ruined church, and Remus breathed in deeply, closing his eyes. It was close to evening; cool and quiet. Under the dimly lit clouds the forest around them was transforming from day to night, the nocturnal creatures yawning and stretching and creeping out of their holes and tunnels.\n\n\nGreyback led Remus up the aisle of the church, through to the arched exit, and they walked - not very far - through the slender beech saplings, past sturdy English oaks, down a narrow hidden pathway which led to a kind of cave at the base of a hill. A den.\n\n\nWithout looking back, Greyback entered, stooping only slightly at the entrance before straightening up as the mouth of the den opened up wider and higher than Remus could have anticipated from the outside. He followed, because there was nothing else to do.\n\n\nInside it smelled like home. Earth and forest and meat and wolf.\n\n\nThough there was no natural light source, as soon as Greyback entered a series of torches along the walls of the den lit themselves, creating a cosy, welcoming space. There was even a fire with a pewter cauldron hung over it brimming with something that smelled thick and savoury. A wooden table beside the fireplace was laden with food of all kinds \u2013 freshly killed and skinned game, bowls of nuts and berries, mushrooms, nettles and bread.\n\n\nThe sides of the cave had been carved out into shelves and hollows full of books and scrolls. There were a few wooden stools scattered about, and Greyback gestured that Remus be seated.\n\n\nRemus sat, staring about. Further back, hidden in shadows, he could smell a bed - or at least the place Greyback slept.\n\n\nMore distracting, though, was the smell of the stew. Remus had taken most of his meals cold over the past week and a half in the dark. The delicious smell of a hot meal threatened to overwhelm him.\n\n\nHe watched his captor take a porcelain bowl from a shelf and ladle a small portion of stew from the cauldron, then pick up a spoon and carry it over to him. Greyback handed him the bowl and Remus took it, still unable to take his eyes off Greyback.\n\n\nHis shape filled the entryway, hard, muscular and unmoving. His coarse dark hair was pulled back in a knot and his yellow eyes bore down on Remus, both curious and challenging at the same time.\n\n\nDespite his larger than life demeanour, there was also a quietness about him that Remus had only seen in wild animals. A still silence which promised something more sinister, like a spring-loaded trap.\n\n\nGreyback took a seat opposite Remus, hands on his knees, and nodded at the bowl of stew warming Remus\u2019s hands.\n\n\n\u201cEat.\u201d He said.\n\n\nWithout hesitation - Remus did not yet know if he was following orders because he had to, or because he wanted to - he scooped up some stew and put the spoon in his mouth. He could have cried. It was the most delicious thing he had ever tasted, hot and full of flavour \u2013 some kind of dark meat and rich onion. He chewed, as instructed, before swallowing hard.\n\n\nGreyback licked his sharp pointed teeth, \u201cGood cub.\u201d\n\n\nRemus ignored him, and continued to eat, suddenly starving hungry. A poem he had once read popped into his head, like a warning:\n\n\n\nThough the goblins cuffed and caught her,\n\n\n\n\nCoaxed and fought her,\n\n\n\n\nBullied and besought her,\n\n\n\n\nScratched her, pinched her black as ink,\n\n\n\n\nKicked and knocked her,\n\n\n\n\nMauled and mocked her,\n\n\n\n\nLizzie uttered not a word;\n\n\n\n\nWould not open lip from lip\n\n\n\n\nLest they should cram a mouthful in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, that was goblins. You mustn't eat food given to you by fairies, or goblins - there was nothing he\u2019d read about werewolves. But then, what had he ever managed to learn about werewolves?\n\n\nGreyback watched him a while longer, as though they were sitting down to supper together; old friends. He waited until Remus had almost finished eating to speak.\n\n\n\u201cPicked on Gaius in the end, eh? Interesting, that. I thought perhaps Castor.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe was being cruel.\u201d Remus answered.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good cub. Beautiful wolf; powerful. But he has a few things to learn about leadership, that I\u2019ll grant you. What do you think of my other children, eh?\u201d\n\n\nRemus finished eating. He swallowed, and sucked on the spoon thoughtfully, before setting it back in the empty bowl. He looked Greyback in the eye.\n\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFor the way they live. There\u2019s no dignity in it.\u201d\n\n\nGreyback\u2019s eyes gleamed.\n\n\n\u201cDignity. What a delightful creature you are, Remus Lupin. Yes, dignity. That\u2019s exactly the word. Exactly.\u201d Greyback was stroking his beard, thoughtfully. \u201cIt is a temporary situation, of course. When this war is won--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhen this war is won,\u201d Remus said, steadily, \u201cWerewolves will be more hated and feared than ever before. Because of what you have done. Because of your crimes.\u201d\n\n\nGreyback tossed back his head and laughed, showing long yellow teeth,\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nTruly\n\n\ndelightful, cub. I worried that so long in that cell might have softened you, but\u2026\u201d\n\n\nGreyback raised a bushy eyebrow, and Remus felt an unpleasant wriggling inside his brain, as though someone was swirling their fingers through his thoughts. He screwed up his face, and Greyback gave a low chuckle deep in his throat, \u201cNo. Still unbroken. My good, strong cub.\u201d\n\n\nRemus stared at him. The wriggling sensation stopped.\n\n\n\u201cYou mean,\u201d he breathed, \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to break me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d Greyback spat, scornfully, \u201cIs that what you think? Are these the vile lies spread about me? Why would a father wish harm upon his children?\u201d\n\n\nRemus cocked his head,\n\n\n\u201cYou tell me. Why would you attack a five year old? Why have me locked up?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTrivia,\u201d Greyback waved a long-nailed hand dismissively, \u201cThese are not the questions you want answers to, do not pretend.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow do you know what I want?!\u201d Remus felt his temper rising, and struggled to keep it under control. He tried to hang on to the feeling of power he\u2019d taken from Gaius, to soak up the magic he could feel in the earthen walls of the den.\n\n\n\u201cI know everything about you, Remus Lupin.\u201d He looked at him with razor sharp eyes once more, and Remus felt that unpleasant shuffling through his thoughts.\n\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not fair.\u201d Remus shook his head, trying to build a wall up against Greyback. \u201cYou\u2019re using legilimency!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPah. A wizard trick. Wolves do not read minds. Wolves see souls.\u201d\n\n\nIt sounded like the same thing to Remus. Greyback\u2019s lips curled into a wicked smile once more,\n\n\n\u201cNo, Remus Lupin. It isn\u2019t the same. One can change one\u2019s mind, after all. Remus Lupin might sympathise with his packmates one day, and revile them the next. That is the mind. But Remus Lupin\u2019s\n\n\nsoul\u2026\n\n\n\u201d\n\n\nGreyback closed his eyes and inhaled, as if Remus smelled particularly delicious.\n\n\n\u201cStop it!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMake me.\u201d\n\n\nRemus tried. He tried very, very hard, forcing the magic within him back out, through his eyes, through his thoughts. It seemed to work. His mind calmed, and Greyback leaned back, looking pleased. Remus was so confused now - he didn\u2019t\n\n\nwant\n\n\nto please Greyback, not ever.\n\n\n\u201cIt's perfectly all right to hate me, you know.\u201d Greyback said, stretching his arms out, rolling his shoulders as though he was preparing for bed - or for a fight, \u201cIt is natural to resent one's father.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re not my father.\n\n\nRemus thought, in the part of his brain where he still felt like himself,\n\n\nI\u2019ve never had a father, and I\u2019ve never needed one.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnswer my questions.\u201d Remus said, as forcefully as he could manage, \u201cIf you care about me so much\u2026 like a\u2026 like a father, then why turn me?! Why hunt me down for years, then stick me in a cage the second I show up?!\u201d\n\n\nGreyback was laughing at him again, rows and rows of teeth, long red tongue.\n\n\n\u201cYou can thank Lyall Lupin for your transformation.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Remus pulled a face, \u201cAwfully human, isn\u2019t it?! Revenge?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSelf-preservation.\u201d Greyback countered, scratching behind his ear amusedly. \u201cLyall had ideas about how my family should be treated. Uneducated ideas. He needed to learn.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen why not attack\n\n\nhim\n\n\n--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause he was\n\n\nweak\n\n\n.\u201d Greyback hissed, \u201cI could smell it on him. No backbone at all, a hypocrite. And I was proved right. A better man would not have abandoned his pup and his bitch. Though perhaps I ought to thank him. He destroyed himself before any of that weakness could creep into you.\u201d He licked his lips, \u201cIt\u2019s become my motto. Get \u2018em young, grow \u2018em strong.\u201d\n\n\nRemus felt like throwing up. He hated Greyback so fiercely it was as if his insides had turned to bile.\n\n\n\u201cIf you believe that,\u201d he carried on, stoically, mouth full of saliva making his words thick and sloppy, \u201cThen why wait so long to find me? You could have snatched me out of the Home any time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI considered it,\u201d Greyback nodded, tilting his head thoughtfully, \u201cI took Livia when she was barely speaking. Castor and Gaius when they were tots. But you were a different case. Dumbledore had his paws all over you before Lyall was even in the ground. I knew what the old codger was thinking - his own pet werewolf; his own tamed beast, all trained up and given a head full of wizard tricks and wizard lies. An educated monster.\u201d He licked his lips lasciviously, \u201cI knew all of this, and I thought\u2026 why not? Let the cub come to me when the time was right, let him learn all he can learn of the wizarding world, and we shall see, then, which side wins out.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSide? You mean\u2026 you or Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNature or nurture.\u201d Greyback sniggered. Remus recoiled, disgusted,\n\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m an experiment?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking.\u201d\n\n\nRemus finally tore his eyes away, unable to stare into Greyback\u2019s laser beam gaze any longer. His eyes caught on the bookcase to his right. They were all classics.\n\n\nThe Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, The Island of Doctor Moreau, The Count of Monte Cristo.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd the cage?\u201d He asked, shakily, staring at the gold lettering on each leatherbound book. \u201cWas that part of the experiment?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was clear that you had grown too reliant on the tricks Dumbledore taught you.\u201d Greyback said, as if it was all perfectly reasonable, \u201cYou were confined only as long as was necessary, to ensure that your true gifts were strong enough to shine through. And they were, cub. Look at you now; just\n\n\nblistering\n\n\nwith power.\u201d\n\n\nRemus looked up at him, finally, meeting those wolfish yellow eyes once more. Fine, then. If he was so powerful, he could use it. Burning with bitter, acid hatred, Remus pushed out once more, focussing as sharply as he could on Greyback\u2019s body.\n\n\n\nMake him weak, make him hurt.\n\n\n\nGreyback straightened his back in his stool, and closed his eyes, grinning as though Remus was caressing him, not firing every foul thing he could. Then the werewolf raised a hand - and Remus saw that it was trembling, very slightly. Still, Greyback was incredibly powerful, and Remus could feel his own magic countered and blocked. Worth a try.\n\n\n\u201cVery good, Remus Lupin,\u201d Greyback said, after a long time, his voice a little more hoarse than it had been. \u201cVery good, cub\u2026\u201d He sighed. \u201cEnough, for tonight, perhaps. We\u2019ll speak again.\u201d\n\n\nRemus stood quickly, feeling as if all this time he had been weighted down to the stool; and now the weight was gone.\n\n\n\u201cOne moment\u2026\u201d Greyback rose as well, and pushed past Remus into the shadowy sleeping chamber behind. He returned seconds later with a large grey fur, and handed it to Remus. \u201cA gift, cub. Welcome to the pack.\u201d\n\n\nRemus took it, and held it over one arm, cautiously. It was beautiful; the soft fur silver and black under his fingers.\n\n\n\u201cI can go?\u201d He asked, glancing at the den mouth, now unguarded and open. He was suddenly nervous.\n\n\n\u201cOf course. You know the way back. You are not in the wizard world now; you are free. Go where you please. Return to the pack. Or else\u2026 if you prefer to sleep here?\u201d His face turned hungry again, his smile mocking, as he stepped aside and gestured towards his own bed.\n\n\nRemus\u2019s stomach turned again, and he backed out of the den as quickly as he could.\n\n\nHe stood outside by himself for a long time. The thought of apparating - of getting out of there as fast as he possibly could; going home to Sirius and London and his friends - occurred only fleetingly.\n\n\nNight had fallen in the forest. Remus breathed in the lovely air, and looked up at the fine lights in the sky. Owls swooped overhead, on the hunt for prey. Foxes crept through the underbrush, moles ploughed through the soil below his feet. He felt as much a part of this place as they were. A natural creature, coming to life.\n\n\nA cool breeze rustled the leaves above him, and he shivered. Without thinking, Remus pulled the fur cloak over his shoulders, wrapping it tight around himself. It felt good, like a second skin. He breathed and exhaled once more, to savour the peace and quiet of being alone. Then he turned away from the den, and returned to his pack.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThings changed, after that, of course. By the time Remus returned to the pack that evening he already had a new place in the hierarchy. Gaius had been freed from his prison, and he did not meet Remus\u2019s eyes; did not challenge him, just slunk away to his corner. Livia made it clear that Remus now outranked Gaius, by approaching first and stroking his new furs, purring with joy,\n\n\n\u201cBeautiful,\u201d she said, \u201cbeautiful.\u201d\n\n\nAnd when it came time to settle in and sleep, Remus had his pick of anywhere he liked on the crypt floor. This had to be a carefully thought through decision; sleep beside Livia, the alpha bitch, and what was that saying? It would certainly tell Gaius exactly where he stood. It\u2019s what Moody would suggest, if Moody had half a clue how to conduct himself in such a situation.\n\n\nHe had reservations about Castor too. For one thing, instinct told him to side with the handsome young man - and he knew that it wasn\u2019t entirely to do with the fact that Castor had helped him. Remus was used to the scent now, but that didn\u2019t make him any less attracted. For another thing, Castor was clearly a dissenter. Siding with him might give rise to suspicion from other members of the pack.\n\n\nBut he was tired and sleepy, and he had made so many life altering decisions already. So he chose Castor, who felt safe at least. Remus would have to beg forgiveness later.\n\n\nIn the days that followed, Remus got to know the pack not only by scent and as fellow outcasts - but as individual people. Plenty of them, like Jeremy, were recent converts. Teenage runaways, disowned children of shamed wizarding families. All of them had difficult stories of hunger and suffering and terrible abuse.\n\n\nFor the first time in his life, Remus felt he had had a privileged childhood. So what if Matron was a stone-hearted old cow who hated children. He\u2019d had a roof over his head.\n\n\nSome of them were kind and funny, some of them were silly and immature. Some of them were sad and shy. Every day Remus grew more desperate to help them; to find a better place and a better life for each and every one.\n\n\nBut of course they didn\u2019t all have the same story. Some of them were not with Greyback for protection or shelter - some of them really\n\n\nwere\n\n\nthere for revenge. They believed in their father\u2019s philosophy wholeheartedly; murder for them was not a crime, only the nature of a predator. The world owed them blood, and they were going to take it.\n\n\n\u201cI believed it too.\u201d Castor said, the next morning. He had offered to show Remus their hunting trails in the forest. They caught rabbits and other game using instinct and magic. \u201cI believed everything he said, for a long time. He's the only teacher I ever had.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut you changed your mind?\u201d Remus asked, half hoping, because he still wasn\u2019t quite sure about Castor\u2019s motivations.\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Castor replied, not noticing Remus\u2019s trepidation. \u201cIt was a slow process.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat triggered it?\u201d Remus was puffing a bit to keep up with Castor, who was lithe and muscular, the epitome of good health, despite his scars.\n\n\n\u201cNo one thing in particular,\u201d Castor said, stopping still and looking around, as though he\u2019d caught a scent. He seemed to think better of it, and carried on walking, head held high, eyes sharp. He was so natural and relaxed in himself. Remus didn\u2019t think\n\n\nhe\n\n\ncould ever be like that. It vaguely made him think of Sirius - except if course Castor talked a lot less. You had to really drag answers out of him.\n\n\n\u201cNothing in particular?\u201d Remus panted, \u201cSomething must have--\"\n\n\n\u201cBooks.\u201d Castor said, striding ahead, on the trail of something.\n\n\n\u201cBooks?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFather encourages us to educate ourselves. To develop independent thoughts. And I did. It is the way of nature, to rebel against one\u2019s father.\u201d\n\n\nThat sounded eerily like Greyback. Castor often did that - they all did. They spoke with one voice, and it was always his.\n\n\n\u201cBut if he encourages that, then why haven\u2019t more of the others--\"\n\n\n\u201cI said that we are encouraged, not forced.\u201d Castor said, a small ironic smile playing on his lips.\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Remus said. He remembered Livia quoting Plato to him. Being educated didn\u2019t mean you all came to the same conclusions.\n\n\n\u201cI listened to what you said, too.\u201d Castor said, finally. \u201cWhen I was trapped by the dryad, in Scotland. I knew you were my enemy, but I did not want to harm you. And then I realised I did not want to harm anybody. I think we can live in peace, away from mankind, as other creatures have learnt to.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs that really what you want--?\u201d\n\n\nCastor put a hand out quickly, and crouched low. There was a rabbit not five feet away. Remus held his breath and watched as Castor crept forward slowly, whispering a calming incantation. When he reached the creature, it hopped dozily into his lap. He stroked it softly for a moment, still whispering. Then he broke its neck.\n\n\nRemus wanted to be disgusted, to feel sorry for the rabbit. But he could already smell the blood and his stomach growled. Castor smiled at him, greyish eyes lighting up. He held out the rabbit, blood sliding down his wrist,\n\n\n\u201cFor you, Remus Lupin.\u201d\n\n\nRemus was flattered.\n\n\nJeremy showed Remus some of the pack\u2019s \u2018gathering\u2019 techniques, which basically amounted to theft. There were towns around the outskirts of the forest, and all they needed to do was apparate there and find an empty house, which could be done by scent.\n\n\nThey were standing in the bedroom of one such house when Jeremy spilled the whole truth about the pack\u2019s part in the war.\n\n\nIf Remus hadn't been bothered by a rabbit being unceremoniously slaughtered in front of him, then burgling a house wasn\u2019t going to curl his hair. In fact, it brought back a few fond memories of his criminal youth. Still, he didn\u2019t really participate. Just nosed through the clothes in the wardrobe while Jeremy searched for jewellery in the dresser.\n\n\n\u201cThe way I see it,\u201d Jeremy said cheerfully, \u201cGreyback might be a bit full of himself, bit high and mighty. But he\u2019s done a lot for me, and plenty others. He cares more than anyone else has since I got this bloody bite.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHave you done any of this self-educating stuff?\u201d Remus asked, casually.\n\n\n\u201cNot for me.\u201d Jeremy said, \u201cNever much into reading. Preferred quidditch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHm.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUgh, pearls.\u201d Jeremy tutted, lifting a knot of them out of a green velvet box. \u201cHate the way they feel in your hands. My mother always wore them - pureblood heirloom.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a pureblood?\u201d Renus turned around, mildly surprised.\n\n\n\u201cNah, mother is. Dad\u2019s a mix. Doesn\u2019t mean much anymore. I\u2019m worse to them than a mudblood, now. Bastards.\u201d He slammed the drawer shut angrily. \u201cThat's one of the things Greyback\u2019s right about. They deserve what they\u2019re getting.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho does?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe purebloods.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Remus knew he sounded stupid, but he was genuinely confused. He had always been told that some of Voldemort\u2019s greatest allies were the pureblood houses - that it was the half-bloods and the muggleborns who he targeted.\n\n\nHe said as much to Jeremy.\n\n\n\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Jeremy nodded blithely, \u201cWe\u2019ve done one or two of those. But most of the time we\u2019re really a scare tactic to keep the old families in line.\u201d\n\n\nRemus pressed for more information and Jeremy - who had been eager to do anything he could for Remus ever since the Gaius incident - was all too happy to elaborate. Voldemort was using the werewolves as little more than hired muscle. If any of his influential wealthy supporters started questioning him a little bit too much, started having doubts, then all it took was a visit from Fenrir Greyback and a few of his mad, feral acolytes \u00a0to get everyone back on the same page.\n\n\n\u201cSeen loads of mansions lately,\u201d Jeremy cackled with laughter. He caught the look Remus was giving him. \u201cOh, what?! I told you, they\n\n\ndeserve\n\n\nit. They shouldn\u2019t have gone over to his side in the first place.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWait, so you don\u2019t even support Voldemort?!\u201d Remus gaped at him.\n\n\n\u201cCourse not, he\u2019s a right weirdo. Scares the shit out of me, to be honest. But, y\u2019know. I didn\u2019t choose this side, it's just the hand I got dealt.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut if you did have a choice, if you--\"\n\n\n\u201cThere is no choice, Remus Lupin!\u201d Jeremy said fiercely, that voice coming out of his mouth which wasn\u2019t his own. \u201cThere is the pack. We can trust no one else. You must get used to it, if you want to be one of us.\u201d\n\n\nAnd that was as far as he could get with any of them. After a certain point, they all reverted back to the same old script. \u00a0Greyback was their leader, and even if they did not agree with him in everything, most if them felt indebted to him, and trusted him before anything else.\n\n\nBy daylight, Remus was never sure if he could really trust Castor or Jeremy - or any of the others. Even Castor, who was interested in hearing what Remus had to say, and who was determined to convince the others to withdraw from the war.\n\n\n\u201cIt is not an easy thing.\u201d Castor tried to explain, \u201cTo realise that our father is wrong, that we must have no part in any wizard affairs, least of all war. It would mean splitting the pack.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan you do that?\u201d Remus asked, impressed. Castor gave a small shrug of his shoulders.\n\n\n\u201cPerhaps.\u201d\n\n\nHelpful.\n\n\nRemus expected to see Greyback again, now he had been fully initiated, but the pack father stayed strangely remote. He occasionally summoned Livia, who Remus learnt had been with him the longest - almost all of her thirty years. (Remus was shocked to learn her age - she seemed at once too young and too old.) Otherwise, Remus was left to his own devices.\n\n\nHe could have left whenever he liked, that made been made clear to him. But he\u2019d told the others in the pack that he had nowhere else to go, like them. He needed their trust, and for that they needed to be able to relate to him. So he never tried to sneak away and send a message to the Order - he wasn\u2019t even sure if that was possible, but he didn\u2019t try. He knew he might never have this chance again - and after all, it was what Dumbledore had bred him for.\n\n\nAs far as Dumbledore and Moody and Ferox and every other adult who liked pushing Remus around their chess board was concerned, he was exactly where he was supposed to be. And he wasn\u2019t miserable. He was lonely, of course; he longed for Sirius like a missing limb, and he\u2019d have done anything for a shower, a cigarette and a bar of chocolate. But the forest had begun to feel like a place he belonged - the other wolves felt like family. His mission grew clearer with every day, and he knew he couldn\u2019t leave. So he stayed in plain sight at all times, and didn\u2019t speak a word about his friendships and connections back home.\n\n\nFriendship was different among the werewolves. Pack solidarity was everything, and Remus felt it too - sometimes he thought he would die to protect them, even Gaius. The only feeling that had ever come close to it was when the marauders were in their animagus forms back at Hogwarts - and Remus supposed that made some sense.\n\n\nSex was different with them, too. Midway through the month, Remus noticed a few pack members pairing off, vanishing into the woods for an hour or so at a time, returning with that all to familiar scent. It was obvious what they were all doing, but no one seemed to mind, or take much notice. It was just another instinct they all accepted and followed without question.\n\n\n\u201cThe desire grows stronger as the moon approaches,\u201d Castor explained, as they lay in the crypt one night trying to ignore the quiet gasping and fumbling around them.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never noticed before.\u201d Remus lied, staring up at the ceiling.\n\n\n\u201cIf you choose to mate,\u201d Castor whispered, \u201cChoose wisely. They look up to you, they will notice favoritism.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus said. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 I have someone already.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA human?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen you plan to return.\u201d Castor finished. He sounded so sad about it. Remus wanted to turn and apologise, comfort him somehow, but that was dangerous territory and he knew it. The air was already thick with lust, and he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do.\n\n\n\u201cI have to, eventually.\u201d Remus said. \u201cBut I want to make sure you\u2019re all safe, first.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe will survive without you, Remus Lupin.\u201d Castor returned, his voice no longer its usual calm steady timbre. \"You are not our leader yet.\""

            "content": "Remus had almost spent a full month in Greyback\u2019s pack before he was truly given a reason to leave. He woke late one morning to find himself almost alone. Confused, he sat up, staring around - he\u2019d grown used to having Castor and Jeremy nearby, he felt horribly exposed without their body heat.\n\n\n\u201cFather summoned them.\u201d A voice came out of the gloom.\n\n\nRemus raised his palm to create a heat-free flame for light, as Castor had taught him. It was easier than\n\n\nlumos\n\n\n, though not as bright. Gaius stepped out from the shadows of one of the chambers. He stared down at Remus. \u201cFather came this morning. Summoned Castor and Livia. Only them. I suppose Castor is forgiven, now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWill they be back soon?\u201d Remus asked warily, drawing his cloak around his shoulders protectively.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect so.\u201d Gaius mused. He was fiddling with something shiny, kept glancing down at it, \u201cThey\u2019ve gone to meet the Dark Lord.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost the moon. He\u2019ll have plans for the pack.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...plans?\u201d Reality came clanging down on Remus\u2019s head, like glass shattering; like a car crash.\n\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Gaius said, apparently uninterested in Remus\u2019s crisis of conscience, \u201cI always wondered why father turned three males. I thought perhaps he wished us to learn to lead together; to share the burden of responsibility. But now I realise. He means us to compete.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you want, Gaius?\u201d Remus stood up, squaring his shoulders to remind Gaius that he was bigger, and stronger, when he wanted to be. \u201cWant me to sing you another song?\u201d\n\n\nGaius sneered at him, cheeks red. He backed away.\n\n\n\u201cYou will not triumph.\u201d He said. He threw the shiny object down at Remus\u2019s feet before turning to leave, and it made a hard, metal sound. It was Remus\u2019s pocket watch.\n\n\n\u201cOi!\u201d Remus yelled, stooping to grab it up. But Gaius was gone.\n\n\nRemus slumped against the wall, running his fingers through his grimy hair. His heart raced, his breathing quickened, and he began to panic.\n\n\nShit\n\n\n.\n\n\nShit shit shit\n\n\n.\n\n\nOf\n\n\ncourse\n\n\nthey were still working with Voldemort - the war hadn\u2019t stopped simply because Remus was there. He felt stupid and na\u00efve - and worst of all, he felt guilty. He was supposed to be on a bloody mission! But he hadn\u2019t been thinking of the Order, not really - he\u2019d been more concerned about protecting the pack than getting back to his friends; his true family. All this time, Remus had thought of himself as a victim - when really he was the worst kind of traitor.\n\n\nHe shrugged off his fur cloak. He didn\u2019t want to look like them.\n\n\nHe badly wanted to see Sirius - after weeks of suppressing it, his longing burst up like a geyser, so that he couldn\u2019t get a grip on it and squash it back down again. Sirius would know what to do - or he\u2019d at least make Remus feel better about everything.\n\n\nRemus looked down at his watch, the only connection he still has to his friends. The gold had lost its lustre, and he rubbed it on his filthy trouser leg to see if that helped. Then he opened and closed it a few times, running the pads of his thumbs along the smooth vine leaf engraving. It had stopped working the day he used it to escape his cell; he\u2019d squeezed all the magic out of it like a sponge. Another betrayal.\n\n\nOnce he had at least calmed his breathing down (\n\n\njesus christ what I wouldn\u2019t do for a fag\n\n\n), Remus tried to think rationally. His first instinct was to get out immediately; just walk into the woods and disapparate.\n\n\nBut then what? Explain to Moody and Ferox that while he\u2019d had a lovely few weeks away, things had got a bit too scary so he\u2019d turned tailed at the first opportunity? No. If Greyback was meeting with Voldemort then that had to mean an attack was coming. Remus couldn\u2019t let that happen.\n\n\nHe would wait, at least to find out if Castor would tell him anything. In the meantime, Remus did his very best to conjure up a happy memory. He would need to send a patronus as soon as possible.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nBrothers! Sisters! Gather near.\n\n\n\nLivia\u2019s voice inside his head had to be one of the least pleasant experiences Remus had had since joining the pack. It worked, though, he scrambled up the stairs of the crypt into the ruined church, where the others were congregating. Greyback stood by the pulpit, Castor and Livia either side of him, backs straight and heads high.\n\n\n\u201cMy children,\u201d Greyback addressed them all, raising his arms like an evangelist preacher, \u201cThe moon approaches, our time is near.\u201d\n\n\nThere was a murmur of excitement at this. For many, the full moons represented a chance to be free; to be one\u2019s true self.\n\n\nGreyback raised a finger to silence them. He smiled paternally, \u201cI have spoken with our benefactor. This moon, we shall feast on our enemies. We have been given the gift of prey.\u201d\n\n\nSome of the pack members cheered and whooped, chattering with even more excitement.\n\n\n\nOh no,\n\n\nRemus\u2019s stomach lurched,\n\n\noh no, oh no\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cLivia and Castor will lead you.\u201d Greyback said, \u201cYou will bring the girl-child to me - the parents you may keep for yourselves.\u201d\n\n\nMore cheering. Not everyone - Remus saw a few of the younger ones glancing at each other shiftily, and Jeremy\u2019s wide eyes were practically burning a hole in Castor\u2019s back.\n\n\nNot all of them\n\n\n, Remus thought,\n\n\nthey\n\n\n\ncan\n\n\n\nbe saved, they can, they can\u2026\n\n\nRemus Lupin.\n\nA voice popped into his head. He blinked, stunned - it was Castor.\nIt is not safe to speak of this here. You will join me in the forests.\n\nRemus looked over at Castor, who was staring blankly ahead, as always, inscrutable. He hadn\u2019t tried communicating like that before, but the pack was close enough, and the magic of the forest pressing in, so he concentrated hard.\n\n\n\nYes. I understand.\n\n\n\nCastor made no sign that he had heard, so Remus just had to hope. Greyback left shortly after that, giving Remus a cruel wink as he passed,\n\n\n\u201cYour time to shine, cub.\u201d He said. Remus knew he ought to nod, or something, but he was too tense, and just stared stiffly back.\n\n\nCastor announced that he was going hunting, and Remus quickly agreed to join him. Livia gave them both an appraising look.\n\n\n\u201cDo not tire yourselves, brothers. We have such games ahead of us.\u201d\n\n\nThey walked through the woods in silence. It was late afternoon, and quite mild for April; the sun lowering but still bright. They\u2019d had very little rain so far this year, but that hadn\u2019t stopped the trees and plants around them from exploding into life. Everything was lush and green and bountiful, and as they approached a small clearing Remus saw that the bluebells had begun to spring up, and the woodland floor ahead of them was carpeted in a glorious haze of soft mauve.\n\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t you miss this?\u201d Castor asked, quietly. He obviously judged them far enough away from Greyback.\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Remus replied. He meant it. He had hated nature all his life - even the forbidden forest. He loved London; the concrete and pollution and the noise. But the past month had changed him, and he knew how much he would miss the peace and quiet, and feeling so close to the earth.\n\n\n\u201cBut your time with us grows short.\u201d Castor said. \u201cI think perhaps all our time is short, now.\u201d He sighed heavily, and looked at Remus with completely human eyes; grey and penitent, \u201c I am ready to defy my father.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you mean -- will you help me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe shall help each other. For the good of the pack. I have a plan, but Remus Lupin, you\n\n\nmust\n\n\nlisten to me, and you\n\n\nmust\n\n\nobey me. I need to know that you will do what needs to be done.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI will never kill for him.\u201d Remus said, fiercely.\n\n\n\u201cBut you might kill.\u201d Castor responded, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a question; it was a statement. And Remus did not deny it.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nThursday 12th April 1979\n\n\nThere were no goodbyes, of course. Remus did not even know who was on their side - his and Castor\u2019s. No names were spoken, he just had to have faith.\n\n\nOn the morning of the full moon Remus crept as far away from the pack as he could to cast his patronus. He hoped that the others wouldn\u2019t pick up on the spell, which was powerful and sure to attract attention.\n\n\nHe\u2019d never sent a message via patronus before, and once again regretted the creature\u2019s fearsome size and aspect. Hopefully it wouldn\u2019t be too terrifying for Sirius to hear Remus\u2019s voice coming from the giant silver wolf\u2019s jaws. He could only manage three words.\n\n\nCastle. Tomorrow. Dawn.\n\n\n\nAnd that was his escape route taken care of - if he survived the night. Castor promised - Remus made him swear on their very blood - that if Remus did not live, then he would get a message to Sirius and the Potters. There was no other way, Remus decided. He had to be there for the attack; the last time he\u2019d warned the Order about werewolves nothing had been done. So he would have to do it himself, and damn the consequences.\n\n\nObviously, he\u2019d prefer not to die, though.\n\n\nAn hour or so before moonrise, the pack apparated together. It was just as well that Remus hadn\u2019t run away to tell Moody at his first opportunity - because he had absolutely no idea where they were going. He was forced to side-along with Livia, and they landed together on a soft mossy patch of grass.\n\n\nRemus wrenched his arm away from her and stared around at his new surroundings. It was such a weird place - just a flat plain of grass, a few trees, a fence - ah. He realised stupidly that they were in a park. Man-made nature. The whole place smelled human and muggle-ish. The rest of the pack were arriving around them, one by one with a *crack* and a thud.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the place,\u201d Castor said, addressing everyone. He pointed over the fence to a row of houses across the road. The park was in a quiet muggle cul-de-sac. \u201cWith the green door.\u201d\n\n\nRemus crept as close to the fence as he dared, and peered over at the building. Had his parents lived in a similar house, once? It looked like the sort of place Hope belonged.\n\n\nIt was a small, detached house. The front door was a cheerful shade of green, and the porch light glowed soft amber in the twilight. Remus could make out the silhouette of someone moving in one of the upstairs windows - the pale pink blind was drawn down, so he could only see shadows. That must be the child\u2019s room, he thought with a terrible wave of nausea.\n\n\nHe couldn\u2019t let this happen. He wouldn\u2019t. If he had to kill Livia. If he had to die himself, he wouldn\u2019t let--\n\n\nwait a minute\n\n\n.\n\n\nA gust of wind blew a scent in his direction. One he recognised. He sniffed the air again. What\n\n\nwas\n\n\nthat? Someone he knew? It smelled almost like Sirius,\n\n\nalmost\n\n\n, but not quite. Old blood; old magic. A relative? Not Regulus, he wouldn\u2019t be caught dead on a street this muggle-ish. Nor either of their parents. It was feminine too, it was more like Narcissa, or\u2026 surely not Andromeda??\n\n\nHe couldn\u2019t be sure, he\u2019d only met her once, when he was thirteen. But she had a daughter. A daughter who would be about five or six, now. Heart pounding, Remus desperately wanted to get closer, to find out more.\n\n\nThen, in an amazing stroke of luck, the green door opened, letting light out into the street. A man stepped out, carrying a shiny black bin bag. He walked to the end of the garden path, opened the dustbin lid, dropped the bag inside, then returned to the house.\n\n\nIt was Ted Tonks.\n\n\n\nNo, no no\n\n\n, Remus thought to himself - if something happened to Andromeda, to her little girl\u2026 Sirius would never forgive him. Remus didn\u2019t know if he would forgive himself.\n\n\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Castor whispered from the bushes behind him, \u201cIt is almost time.\u201d\n\n\nRemus turned and nodded. He hoped this would work. He\u2019d never been so close to praying in his life. A stab of pain shot through his back. The moon was rising.\n\n\nHe backed into the park, where a few of the others had curled up on the ground, preparing for the agonies of transformation.\n\n\nRemus looked at Castor, standing beside him. It was a peculiar sensation - he had transformed in front of the marauders before, but never with others who were experiencing the same thing. Castor caught his eye, and seeming to understand at once, reached out his hand.\n\n\nRemus took it, gratefully, and gripped it hard, clenching his teeth as the pain swept through him. Castor gripped back, sharing his suffering, but also lending strength. They both fell to their knees at the same time, and Remus remembered no more.\n\n\n\n\nThe wolf stretched its limbs and sniffed at the night air. Pack. Prey. Magic.\n\n\n\n\nHe rolled over in the grass, pleased to be free, unencumbered by human worries.\n\n\n\n\nHis pack mate nudged him, huffing softly, and he remembered - he had something to do. This was not a night for playing, or for hunting.\n\n\n\n\nThe she-wolf, and the one that hated him both snapped at the others, and the young ones ducked their heads, lowered their haunches.\n\n\n\n\nBut he would not - he was not a cub; he was full grown. He was strong as them.\n\n\n\n\nThe pack-mate with the scarred nose smelled good, he was strong too. He growled at the others, so the wolf did too; puffing up his body and showing all his teeth so that they knew.\n\n\n\n\nThe scarred one gave out a bark, then, and turned away, running for the trees. Some of the others followed, confused.\n\n\n\n\nThe dark wolf, the wolf who hated him, snarled and leapt at the scarred one, onto his back. They grappled, turning over in the grass growling and snapping.\n\n\n\n\nThe she-wolf watched. She sat, and yawned. She need not involve herself.\n\n\n\n\nThe rest of the pack watched avidly, panting and yapping as blood was drawn.\n\n\n\n\nHe wanted to help, to jump in and start biting - but the scarred one needed to win it himself. It was his fight.\n\n\n\n\nThe scent in the air changed, and the she-wolf stood, ears up, tail swishing.\n\n\n\n\nA human.\n\n\n\n\nThey had been heard. She began to stalk towards the fence, hunting, as the stupid human shouted in its stupid human language.\n\n\n\n\nNot quite knowing why, he howled, long and as loud as he could.\n\n\n\n\nThe she-wolf whipped around, growling fiercely at him, pulling rank, but he howled again.\n\n\n\n\nThe human retreated, fast. They knew now. They would bring back others. He had endangered the pack.\n\n\n\n\nThe she-wolf barked at the dark one, but he was already pinned to the ground by the scarred one. Victory. The young wolves looked up to the scarred one now, sniffing at him and lowering their heads.\n\n\n\n\nThe scarred one barked, then climbed off the dark one. He turned and began to walk away. Some followed. The pack divided.\n\n\n\n\nThe she-wolf ran after the scarred one, to bring him back, to restore order. But she would not catch them. They were a new pack now; unless she killed the scarred one they would not follow anyone else.\n\n\n\n\nHe wanted to go too. He wanted to run with them forever, and be their leader, and chase deer through the dark nights\u2026\n\n\n\n\nBut no. He had to do this first. He had to protect\u2026 to protect\u2026 what was it? It was so hard to think, when the delicious scent of human meat was so close; coming in on all sides.\n\n\n\n\nThe dark one limped to its feet. Remus growled. It snarled back at him, jaws frothing, eyes baleful.\n\n\n\n\nHe remembered, now. Protect the pack. He pounced, jaws wide and claws bared.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nAll he knew was pain, pain and blood, as Remus\u2019s body pulled itself back into it's human shape. He screamed, and Gaius\u2019s blood ran down his gullet, rich and warm. It was in his teeth, under his tongue, it was everywhere, and Gaius\u2019s body lay there, limp and pale, throat dark and glistening.\n\n\nThere was no time for shock. The moon was setting, and people were coming, and Remus wasn\u2019t even fully human yet, but there was no time! He squeezed his eyes shut, gritted his teeth, and apparated.\n\n\n*CRACK*\n\n\nHe landed flat on his face with a hard grunt. His ankle cracked sickeningly against a rock. He gasped, rolling into a ball, tears springing in his eyes as he vowed never to apparate right after a transformation ever again.\n\n\nHis whole foot throbbed, shooting all the way up his shin, making him feel giddy. He was still sticky with blood and without any clothes all he could do was curl up in pain on the grass. Was he even in Cornwall?! He couldn\u2019t tell; where was the castle?!\n\n\n\u201cFuck!\u201d He sobbed, exhausted and defeated.\n\n\n\u201cMoony?!\u201d A shout came up from over the side of the hill.\n\n\nRemus rolled onto his back and closed his eyes, so relieved he thought he\u2019d faint.\n\n\n\u201cSirius!\u201d He called back, as the heavy footsteps pounded closer.\n\n\nAnd then he was there, and\n\n\noh god\n\n\nRemus just about fell apart. Sirius threw his cloak over him and pulled him close and wrapped his arms around him. Remus clutched him back, trembling, the pain in his leg now threatening to overwhelm him.\n\n\n\u201cYou came back!\u201d Sirius gasped, voice shrill, \u201cYou came back!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course I did...\u201d Remus said, woozily.\n\n\n\u201cAre you bleeding?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot my blood\u2026\u201d and then everything was going dark around the edges, and he was so exhausted he closed his eyes. And nothing more."

            "content": "He came to in a small white room, with a low ceiling striped with black beams. There was a little square window, but the curtains were drawn over. Someone had washed the blood off him, thank goodness, though he could still smell it, faintly, and taste it too. He was lying in a single bed, and other than a little bedside table with an old lamp on it, there wasn\u2019t much else in the room.\n\n\nThe door was slightly ajar, and Remus could hear voices in the corridor outside.\n\n\n\u201cMarlene\u2019s here,\u201d James\u2019s voice came through clearly, \u201cShould I let her up? Did you ask him any questions?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, send her up. He\u2019s not awake...\u201d Sirius said, his voice sounding odd. \u201cBut it's definitely him. Has to be.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou're sure?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe first thing he said when he landed was \u2018fuck\u2019, I\u2019m pretty certain.\u201d Sirius snapped.\n\n\n\u201cFair.\u201d James replied, without humour. He lowered his voice to a whisper, \u201cPadfoot\u2026 all that blood. And with the attack last night--\"\n\n\n\u201cLet's just see what he has to say, before we jump to any conclusions, shall we?! Send Marlene up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut if it's not\n\n\nsafe\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll stay in the bloody room. Can we please just get someone to\n\n\nlook\n\n\nat him, for fuck\u2019s sake?! He hasn\u2019t even got a wand!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk, ok\u2026\u201d James relented.\n\n\n\nGod,\n\n\nRemus thought, as shame settled over him like dust.\n\n\nThey think I\u2019m not me. They think I\u2019m a spy.\n\n\nHow bad had the war become, in the month he\u2019d been away? He racked his brain quickly for a way to prove his identity. The thought of Sirius not trusting him was too painful to bear.\n\n\nThere was a mess of footsteps in the hall outside, and finally the door opened. Remus tried to sit up at once, pulling himself up by his arms as Sirius entered the room,\n\n\n\u201cPadfoot, I swear it's me, it's Moony! I helped you make the marauders map, and we put rose hips in Snivelllus\u2019 bed, and we went skating on the lake at Christmas and I hated it but you were really good, and\u2026 and\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShh, Moony,\u201d Sirius soothed, sitting on the bed carefully and placing gentle hands on his shoulder, \u201cLie down for fuck\u2019s sake, Godric knows what you broke apparating like that you silly sod\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know it's me?!\u201d Remus gripped Sirius\u2019s arms, but allowed himself to be put back to bed.\n\n\n\u201cOf course I do.\u201d Sirius leaned over and kissed his forehead, \u201cI\u2019d know you anywhere. Look, sorry about Prongs, he\u2019s just on edge. Things have just been a bit\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAll right, all right, give him some room!\u201d\n\n\nSirius whipped around as Marlene stormed into the room, green Healer\u2019s robes flying and leather bag in hand.\n\n\nShe shoved Sirius off the bed and leaned over Remus, laying a cool hand on his forehead and looking in his eyes, her freckled face full of sweet concern. She smiled,\n\n\n\u201cHello sweetheart,\u201d she said softly, \u201cWhere have you been, eh? You\u2019ve had us all worried sick.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHi Marlene,\u201d Remus smiled back fondly. \u201cDid you qualify as a Healer while I was gone?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHardly,\u201d she laughed, \u201cStill very much a novice. But I\u2019m the best the Order could do at short notice so\u2026\u201d She straightened up, hands on her hips, \u201cRight. What's the damage?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHurt my ankle,\u201d Remus reached down to pull up the blanket over his sore foot. It looked awful in the light of day, all swollen and black with bruising. Sirius covered his mouth, but Marlene just tutted,\n\n\n\u201cEasy enough.\u201d She tapped it with her wand, and Remus felt a funny ticklish feeling before *pop* - and it was as good as new. \u201cYou\u2019ll still need to rest,\u201d Marlene cautioned.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a legend, Marls,\u201d Remus said gratefully, and then began to cough, that rough raspy bark he\u2019d almost got used to now. \u201cSorry,\u201d he spluttered, eyes watering, \u201cGot a bit of a cough.\u201d\n\n\nSirius was wincing, and looked more distressed than ever, hand still over his mouth. Marlene pulled down the bedsheets and lay her head directly on Remus\u2019s bare chest, listening.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Bit of a cough\u2019 my arse.\u201d She tutted, surfacing, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a stonking great chest infection, is what.\u201d\n\n\nShe began emptying her bag, pulling out ointments and potion bottles, \u201cI\u2019ll have to ask someone at St Mungo\u2019s what's best for that, I haven\u2019t done infections yet\u2026 now\u2026 Madam Pomfrey asked me to make sure you got this, it\u2019s her own sleeping draught. I\u2019m working on one myself, but hers will be stronger\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give it to him yet!\u201d Suddenly James was in the room, starting forward with his arm out. Everyone turned to look at him, and he rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly, \u201cEr\u2026 sorry. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve finally got hold of Mad-Eye and he\u2019s on his way\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Remus said to the room.\n\n\nMarlene tutted again. She set the potion bottle down on the bedside table.\n\n\n\u201cOne of you make sure he drinks the whole thing as soon as possible, ok?\u201d She gave James and Sirius a severe look, and they both nodded earnestly. \u201cI have to go to work before I\u2019m missed.\u201d She said, straightening up once more.\n\n\nShe squeezed Remus\u2019s hand. \u201cSo happy to have you back, darling.\u201d\n\n\nHe squeezed back, feeling a bit better about everything. They cared about him. He was safe with them. He lay back on his pillow and tried to focus on that feeling.\n\n\nJames and Sirius stood about awkwardly.\n\n\n\u201cHi Prongs,\u201d Remus tried, a bit wary.\n\n\n\u201cHiya Moony,\u201d James smiled, his eyes tired and dark, \u201cYou all right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFelt worse.\u201d\n\n\nJames made a sound that wasn\u2019t quite a laugh.\n\n\n\u201cWhere are we, anyway?\u201d Remus asked, looking around at the pokey little room.\n\n\n\u201cCornwall.\u201d Sirius said. \u201cRemember the pub near the castle? Rented a room. You were\u2026 when you got here, I didn\u2019t want to move you. Seemed like the best place. Out of the way.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoes anyone else know--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d James said. \u201cOnly us, Marlene and Moody. It\u2019s been\u2026 things have been hard, and with the attack last night, we thought--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAttack?!\u201d Remus sat up again, as the events of the night before came flooding back in a riot of blood and teeth and hair. \u201cShit, what happened?! Did anyone\u2026 was anyone\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot on our side.\u201d Sirius said.\n\n\nThat didn\u2019t make Remus feel any better, but he tried to look happy about it. He couldn\u2019t let his friends know just how blurry the lines between \u2018our side\u2019 and \u2018their side\u2019 had become for him.\n\n\n\u201cMoony,\u201d James started. \u201cLast night, were you there--?\u201d\n\n\nThe door swung open once more, creaking loudly, and Alastor Moody came hobbling into the room, his face set with a look of grim determination. James and Sirius backed out of the way, as Mad-Eye approached Remus\u2019s bed. Remus\u2019s first instinct was to duck under his blankets and hide like a little kid.\n\n\n\u201cLupin.\u201d Moody nodded, his electric blue magical eye whirring in its socket, giving him a very thorough once-over. \u201cYou made it back, then.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus croaked.\n\n\nMoody held his wand up, pointing it in Remus\u2019s face.\n\n\n\u201cOi!\u201d Sirius started, but James held out an arm to stop him.\n\n\nMoody fixed Remus with a very serious gaze.\n\n\n\u201cMother\u2019s maiden name?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJ-Jenkins!\u201d Remus stuttered, terrified. Moody nodded, and lowered his wand.\n\n\n\u201cNo offence,\u201d he said, glancing at Sirius, \u201cProtocol.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Remus swallowed, heart pounding.\n\n\n\u201cHow are you? Been seen to?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMarlene was here a minute ago,\u201d James said. \u201cShe\u2019ll be back later.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo one else, do you hear?\u201d Moody said, \u201cNot until I say so. We need to limit his exposure for now, until the furor\u2019s died down.\u201d He waved his wand, and a chair appeared from thin air. Moody sat down, and looked at Remus once more. \u201cPotter, Black, you can go.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sirius said, raising his chin. His defiant look hadn't changed since he was eleven. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\n\n\nMoody gave him another look, his tongue playing in the corner of his mouth.\n\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d He grunted. \u201cBut keep your mouth shut. I don\u2019t want to hear a peep, got it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI um. I\u2019d better go.\u201d James said, rubbing the back of his head again, \u201cSorry Moony, I need to get home\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Remus said, though he didn\u2019t really understand. Did James no longer trust him?\n\n\nJames said something to Sirius before leaving, but Remus didn\u2019t catch it, and didn\u2019t try to eavesdrop. He was too busy holding his nerve against Moody.\n\n\nHe wasn\u2019t up to a battle of wills, not after the last few weeks. Now that he knew the building they were in was muggle, he felt the absence of magic more keenly. He\u2019d been used to the enchanted forest, with its unending pool of shared power. Back in the real world, everything felt so mundane. He felt weaker than ever, and began to cough again.\n\n\nJames left, and Sirius handed Remus a glass of water.\n\n\n\u201cThis can\u2019t take too long.\u201d Sirius said to Moody, \u201cHe\u2019s supposed to rest, after a full moon, Marlene said--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot a peep, Black.\u201d Moody snapped, his blue eye fixing Sirius with a hard stare, the normal, brown one still watching Remus.\n\n\nSirius was quiet, but he was clearly not happy about it. He folded his arms petulantly, and looked away. Remus felt a rush of love for him, the spoilt brat.\n\n\n\u201cI was there, last night.\u201d Remus said, quickly, to get things moving. He thought it was probably best to be as honest as possible from the beginning. \u201cI was at the Tonks house, I know what happened - well, most of it - was anyone\u2026 did anyone\u2026?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOne body recovered.\u201d Moody said. \u201cOne of Greyback\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGaius.\u201d Remus said. He wasn\u2019t sure how he felt. He\u2019d killed somebody.\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not start there.\u201d Moody said, watching his face, \u201cI want to start at the beginning. Where have you been for the past month? Leave nothing out.\u201d\n\n\nRemus was weak and exhausted and sore, but he was not an idiot. He left plenty out. But he also said a lot more than was probably safe. He didn\u2019t look at Sirius the whole time; he knew that would make things impossible.\n\n\nHe explained how the pack had kidnapped him, and locked him up for a week and a half. How he\u2019d finally met with Greyback - he heard Sirius breathe in sharply at this, but Moody\u2019s expression didn\u2019t even flicker. He told them most of the things Greyback had said, though he knew none of it was useful to anyone except him. He confirmed that the pack had been working with Voldemort, keeping the old families scared enough to stay loyal.\n\n\n\u201cYou were imprisoned the whole time?\u201d Moody asked.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026 no.\u201d Remus twisted his mouth, nervously. \u201cThey broke my wand, but\u2026 I could have left any time. I didn\u2019t because I thought\u2026 well, I knew it was only a matter of time before they planned an attack, and I wanted to learn as much as I could.\u201d\n\n\nHe kept his voice steady the whole time, and hoped he was still a convincing liar. Moody did not comment.\n\n\n\u201cAnd the attack?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight, yeah.\u201d Remus nodded. \u201cI had to go with them, because Cas-- one of the other werewolves, he was planning to break from the pack. He wanted to be peaceful, to get away from Greyback. He was my ally.\u201d Remus felt Sirius\u2019s eyes on him, and hoped it was all in his head. \u201cSo I helped him, and he helped me. He led the others away, and I stayed back to stop anyone from trying to attack the house.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhile you were a wolf?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes. I can think better, when there are other wolves there. I tried to warn Mr and Mrs Tonks, I howled, so they\u2019d know they were in danger.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh. So that was you.\u201d Moody nodded, \u201cTed said something about that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen them? Are they ok?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShaken up, but no harm done.\u201d Moody gave a curt nod. \u201cHow many of Greyback\u2019s pack have defected?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. At least half? Maybe there are only four or five left who are loyal.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood to know. Can you give me names?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t use any names.\u201d Another lie, but he just couldn\u2019t do it.\n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Moody nodded. He watched Remus for a bit longer. Then he sniffed and stood up. \u201cLie low for a bit, eh? I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d He turned to leave.\n\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d Remus reached out. Moody turned back, a curious look on his face. Remus bit his lip. \u201cThe body.\u201d He said. \u201cGaius. That was me. I killed him.\u201d\n\n\nSaying it out loud made it distressingly real. He felt queasy, and didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to look Sirius in the eye ever again. Moody kept looking at him. He tilted his head.\n\n\n\u201cWhile you were a wolf?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd he was a wolf? Trying to attack a young family?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, but--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis is a war, Lupin. Get some rest. Don\u2019t dwell on it.\u201d\n\n\nAnd he left, and that was it. Everything Remus had put himself through for almost thirty days, boiled down to a few key tactical points. He fidgeted with the blanket. It was old, and bobbly, and reminded him of the rough army-style blankets he\u2019d grown up with. Sirius was still standing by, watching him, but Remus couldn\u2019t look up, he just couldn\u2019t.\n\n\nThankfully, Sirius broke the silence first.\n\n\n\u201cGot your patronus. Bloody hell, where did you learn to do that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Remus nodded, still looking down, \u201cYeah, I dunno, I\u2019d seen Ferox do it once.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWithout your wand?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t need it, not always\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\n\nMore silence. And then -- \u201cI missed you so fucking much!\u201d Sirius burst out, with such force and passion that Remus finally looked up at him. His eyes were wide, and shimmering with tears. He looked as exhausted as Remus felt, and Remus realised that he must have been up all night, too.\n\n\n\u201cI missed you too!\u201d\n\n\nSirius bolted towards Remus, arms out, but hung back at the last moment,\n\n\n\u201cCan I\u2026 is it ok?\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded, reaching for him, and Sirius came over and enveloped him in a hug that went on for long, wonderful minutes. Remus felt as if he\u2019d finally been given permission to exhale, and he closed his eyes and felt the warm, comforting weight of Sirius against him.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Remus whispered into Sirius\u2019s hair, \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry I was gone so long.\u201d\n\n\nSirius pulled away finally, wiping his eyes briskly,\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better have this potion.\u201d He reached for the bottle and uncorked it.\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Remus said, too tired to argue. He took the potion and gulped it down in a few seconds.\n\n\n\u201cShall I let you rest?\u201d Sirius asked, anxiously. Remus shook his head vehemently,\n\n\n\u201cNo, please stay? Will you lie here with me, for a bit?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere's not much room\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCalling me fat?\u201d Remus poked his tongue out, shuffling aside to make space. Sirius grinned at him, and lay down.\n\n\nHe put an arm gently across Remus\u2019s shoulder, and they lay on their sides facing each other.\n\n\n\u201cDoes James hate me?\u201d Remus asked, finally.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sirius frowned. Oh god, he was so beautiful this close up, how had Remus forgotten? \u201cNo, of course not. He's got a lot on his mind. His parents aren\u2019t well.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh no, what's wrong?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re just old.\u201d Sirius said, sadly. \u201cThe war\u2026 it's been so much harder, lately.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPlease tell me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou should sleep.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPlease?\u201d\n\n\nSirius sighed. He looked down, then back up, and his eyes were shining once more.\n\n\n\u201cWe lost the Prewetts. Gid and Fab.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was awful. Five Death Eaters.\n\n\nFive\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. Is Molly ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us are.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh Sirius.\u201d Remus hugged him again. \u201cI wish I could have been with you\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI thought\u2026\u201d Sirius shut his eyes, then shook his head, hair rustling against the pillow. \u201cNo, never mind, it's over now. You're here. You\u2019re safe.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Remus repeated, feeling the sleeping draught start to kick in. Sirius stroked his hair gently.\n\n\n\u201cRemus\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm,\u201d Remus shifted, making himself more comfortable, \u201cPlease call me Moony? No one has for so long.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMoony.\u201d Sirius leaned forward and kissed his cheek very gently. \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI love you too.\u201d Remus smiled, slipping into a warm and happy dream."

Marlene came back on the first evening, as good as her word, and brought a potion for Remus\u2019s chest infection. She prescribed rest, but the next day Remus was going mad from being cooped up, so he and Sirius caught the bus to the beach.\n\n\nIt was too cool for swimming, being April, so they just walked. It was very quiet out of the tourist season, so it was ok to hold hands, too, for a little bit.\n\n\nRemus closed his eyes and breathed in the sea air, smiling. The sky was grey, threatening rain, but wind was fresh on his face, and he felt better.\n\n\n\u201cWhen we get home,\u201d Sirius said brightly, \u201cWe\u2019ll go to Ollivander\u2019s to get you a new wand.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGreat.\u201d Remus nodded. He hadn\u2019t done any magic since he\u2019d been back. Didn\u2019t trust himself.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s if Mary\u2019ll hold off on your welcome home party,\u201d Sirius chuckled, \u201cShe was going bonkers worrying. I think she must still have a thing for you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHa.\u201d Remus replied.\n\n\n\u201cAnd Lily, obviously. She really wants to tell you something, but she said to wait until we\u2019re all in the same room.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t wait for everything to be back to normal. Back to being marauders, eh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cD\u2019you remember what sort of wand Lyall had? Maybe you can get the same one again.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMoony?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\nSirius was quiet after that, and Remus felt guilty. After his brusque de-briefing with Moody, Remus hadn\u2019t been in a very talkative mood. He was too anxious to say very much - he didn\u2019t know what Sirius might think of him. And on top of that, Remus was struggling more than he thought he would, being away from the pack. He was thrilled to be back with Sirius, of course. But at the same time, he felt he was missing something.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t want Sirius to worry, so he did his best to be normal.\n\n\n\u201cSo nice to be outside.\u201d He commented as they walked.\n\n\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re Moony?!\u201d Sirius teased, pretending to be affronted, \u201c\n\n\nMy\n\n\nMoony hates going outside\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell spend a week locked in a dungeon and tell me how\n\n\nyou\n\n\nfeel about fresh air.\u201d Remus muttered.\n\n\nSirius stopped and looked at him, his mouth slightly open, expression hurt. \u201cSorry.\u201d Remus said, guiltily. He took Sirius\u2019s hand again. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\n\nHe\u2019d been doing that a lot, since he got back. Snapping. The smallest thing might set him off, and Sirius was bearing the brunt.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d Sirius replied, shakily. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t make fun of you. After everything.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t have to treat me like I\u2019m fragile, or something. I just need to get over it, it\u2019s my fault.\u201d\n\n\nSirius didn\u2019t say anything for a long time. Remus fought to urge to probe his mind, as the werewolves had taught him to do. He didn\u2019t know if it worked on non-werewolves, but he did know that Sirius had extremely strong feelings about having his private thoughts invaded.\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to \u2018get over it\u2019.\u201d Sirius said, finally. \u201cBut it might help to talk.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened, in the pack.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2018ve talked about that already; I\u2019ve told Moody everything. You were there.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus.\u201d Sirius raised his voice slightly. \u201cCome on. You didn\u2019t tell him\n\n\neverything\n\n\n. I know you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEverything important to the war effort.\u201d Remus said, firmly.\n\n\n\u201cSo nothing else happened then?!\u201d Sirius let go of Remus\u2019s hand, because his own hands were suddenly in the air, gesturing wildly. \u201cThey just locked up up, then let you go, and it was all\n\n\nfine\n\n\n??\u201d\n\n\n\u201cObviously not.\u201d Remus folded his arms, suddenly feeling the chill. \u201cBut no one wants to hear about things like that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe I want to hear.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHere we go.\u201d Remus rolled his eyes, \u201cWell then? What do you want to hear?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy did you go in the first place? Why didn\u2019t you come back to me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI knew it.\u201d Remus said, tightening his arms around his body, \u201cYou\u2019re angry with me!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not, I\u2019m just...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat's what you meant, wasn\u2019t it?! The night I got back!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know! \u2018\n\n\nYou came back\n\n\n\u2019 that's what you said! You thought I wasn\u2019t going to! You thought I\u2019d left for good!\u201d Remus was shouting, all of a sudden, and he wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d got so angry, but now it was just burning him up.\n\n\n\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t!\u201d Sirius shouted back, \u201cI just\u2026 I just didn\u2019t know\n\n\nwhat\n\n\nto think! Do you know what it was like for me?? You just disappeared, and no one would let me look for you, and fucking Ferox wouldn\u2019t tell me anything, and James was a mess with his parents getting sick, and the fucking Prewetts...\u201d\n\n\nSirius didn\u2019t shout often, not as often as Remus anyway, and his voice got very high very quickly, suddenly sounding incredibly posh and haughty. This just riled Remus up even more.\n\n\n\u201cOh\n\n\npoor you\n\n\n! Jesus, I thought you\u2019d got over this spoilt brat routine by now! We\u2019re not twelve anymore Black!\u201d\n\n\nSirius\u2019s mouth fell open now, utterly affronted. Remus felt more alive than he had in days, but he wasn\u2019t ever going to admit it. He just kept shouting, shattering the peace of the empty beach, voice ringing against dark wet sand.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m not like you, I don\u2019t want to whinge about every unpleasant thing that happens to me!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLike what?!\u201d Sirius yelled, cheeks red, and eyes bright, so that for a moment Remus questioned whether Sirius was enjoying this just as much as he was, \u201cGo on, if I\u2019m so selfish and terrible, please enlighten me on the true nature of noble suffering, Remus, I know that's your speciality!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh\n\n\nup yours\n\n\n!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell? Why\n\n\ndidn\u2019t\n\n\nyou come back?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause they were fucking with my head!\u201d Remus practically screamed this, the waves seemed to crash louder and seagulls cried overhead in answer.\n\n\nHe was ablaze, filled with words that came tumbling out of him as soon as he thought them,\n\n\n\u201cBecause I never felt like that before - they were my family, and we were all the same, we were all at home there, and it was\u2026 it felt like the only place in the world I was meant to be! All that, it was all that except\u2026\u201d and now tears were coming, scalding hot, \u201cExcept\n\n\nhe\n\n\nwas there, that fucking\u2026 that monster. He was so evil, so\u2026 and I was scared, and I wanted to come home, to you, I\n\n\ndid\n\n\n, but I couldn\u2019t just leave them with a man like that. And they could\u2026 they could\n\n\ndo\n\n\nthings I didn\u2019t know I could do, they taught me\u2026 And I just didn\u2019t know who I was anymore.\u201d\n\n\nHe wiped his face, the tears dripping off his chin. He looked Sirius in the eye. \u201cI don\u2019t know who I am.\u201d\n\n\nThey stared each other out, as the echoes subsided. Remus was breathing heavily, his cheeks hot, but he felt\n\n\ngood\n\n\n. Relieved.\n\n\nFinally, Sirius spoke. He put his hands in his pockets and squinted around, off into the distance. He smiled,\n\n\n\u201cWhy is it always this beach eh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Remus blinked, caught off guard. Sirius looked at him, eyes twinkling.\n\n\n\u201cWhy is this the beach where we have all the big revelations?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019re just dramatic.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\nvery\n\ndare\nyou!\u201d Sirius was smirking, and Remus laughed, despite himself. \u201cWell?\u201d Sirius said, \u201cFeel better?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. Oi, wait a minute, did you just deliberately try to piss me off??\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Sirius looked away again, piously, \u201cNot at first\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDickhead.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt worked.\u201d\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t respond, because he really did feel better, and he didn\u2019t want to fight again. They kept walking, and eventually reached roughly the spot where they had all camped out two years ago. The wind was kicking up, sweeping across the grassy sand dunes, and the campsite was empty. It didn\u2019t look like the same place.\n\n\n\u201cThink we\u2019ll ever come back here?\u201d Remus asked, hands deep in his pockets to stop his coat flapping in the breeze.\n\n\n\u201cI hope so.\u201d Sirius replied. \u201cIt\u2019s my patronus thought, this place.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs it?\u201d Remus looked at him, surprised.\n\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t had any better summers yet.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFair point.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOi, look!\u201d Sirius wandered off towards a group of rocks, bent and picked up a big long stick. He waggled it at Remus, grinning, \u201cWant to play fetch?\u201d\n\n\nRemus laughed,\n\n\n\u201cGo on then.\u201d\n\n\nSirius glanced around covertly to confirm they were alone, then transformed into Padfoot. Remus was grateful - he\u2019d done enough talking now, and it was a relief to just play with canine-Sirius for a few hours. The big black dog raced up and down the beach, chased waves, played fetch and generally had an excellent time, and on the bus back to the pub both of them fell asleep.\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until much later that night, after dinner (\n\n\noh, how Remus had missed real food! Mashed potato! Sausages! Gravy!\n\n\n), when they were getting ready for bed, that Sirius brought it up again.\n\n\nRemus was yawning as he crawled under the covers, and Sirius got in beside him, quietly, turning off the bedside lamp. The bed was so narrow that Remus had to lie with his back to the wall, an arm around Sirius\u2019s waist and a face full of silky black hair which he didn\u2019t really mind.\n\n\n\u201cI know who you are.\u201d Sirius whispered into the empty quiet of the dark bedroom.\n\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d Remus asked, sleepy and confused. Sirius pulled Remus\u2019s hand to his mouth and kissed his fingers.\n\n\n\u201cYou said you don\u2019t know who you are any more. But I do. You\u2019re my Moony. Always will be. Ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk, Padfoot.\u201d\n\n\nFor now it was enough.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nMoody got word to them that they could return to their flat, provided that Remus kept a low profile for a while - he didn\u2019t specify for how long. This meant no Order meetings and no missions - he wasn\u2019t even allowed to visit the Potters\u2019 house. For all intents and purposes, Remus Lupin had vanished off the face of the earth a month ago and never returned.\n\n\n\u201cI bet he just wants to wait for the next full moon to get the all clear.\u201d Sirius suggested. \u201cAnyway, you deserve a break.\u201d\n\n\nRemus just shrugged.\n\n\n\u201cServed my purpose now, I s\u2019pose. They don\u2019t know what to do with me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk about yourself like that.\u201d Sirius snapped irritably. They\u2019d been stuck in the same tiny room for too long.\n\n\nThey apparated back, and Remus began to feel a bit more himself once he was really home. The flat was immaculately tidy - apparently Sirius had a lot of nervous energy while Remus was away - but otherwise everything was as it should be.\n\n\nNo one was supposed to know that Remus was back, but of course James had told Lily and Peter, and Marlene had told Mary, so the first evening they were home everyone came over at once. Luckily Lily had the presence of mind to bring food, because Sirius had nothing at all in the house.\n\n\n\u201cBeen eating at the Potters\u2019.\u201d He mumbled, bashfully.\n\n\nRemus and Lily went into the kitchen to set out sausage rolls, cheese and pineapple sticks and sandwiches out on plates. Lily set down her carrier bags on the counter and flung herself at him, arms around his waist, head on his shoulder. Remus patted her gently, when he realised she was crying,\n\n\n\u201cArgh, Lily, please don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d She sobbed, her voice thick and muffled against his best woolly jumper, \u201cI just\u2026 I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see you again!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGod, you\u2019re making more of a fuss than Padfoot.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot likely,\u201d She laughed, stepping back and wiping her cheeks, \u201cHe was a complete wreck while you were gone - you wouldn\u2019t have recognised him. I don\u2019t think he even combed his hair.\u201d\n\n\nRemus felt a horrid stab of guilt. He didn\u2019t want to be gloomy in front of Lily, though, so he just gave her a breezy smile and said,\n\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve got something to tell me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh! Er\u2026 when everyone\u2019s here\u2026\u201d Lily was blushing, and suddenly focussed very hard on chopping up carrots for the dips she\u2019d brought.\n\n\nIt didn\u2019t take much longer for Marlene and Peter to arrive, straight from work. Peter even had a briefcase now, with his initials on it. Apparently he\u2019d been doing all right for himself at the Ministry, and Remus tried not to be too bitter about it.\n\n\nMarlene insisted on giving Remus another once-over in the bedroom, checking his ankle, which was good as new, and his chest, which was much better.\n\n\n\u201cHonestly, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still smoking.\u201d She tutted as he lit up, buttoning his shirt. \u201cYou know it kills muggles.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDie young and leave a pretty corpse,\u201d he winked at her, trying not to think about Hope\u2019s lung cancer. The fact was that smoking and drinking were the only things he felt like doing these days.\n\n\nMary burst into tears as soon as she arrived, and leapt into Remus\u2019s arms.\n\n\n\u201cYou absolute bastard!\u201d She whispered into his neck, \u201cI could kill you!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMissed you too.\u201d Remus said, squeezing her back.\n\n\nOnce they were all together, James and Sirius took over as hosts, which was a relief. Remus felt suddenly very tired, and sat on the couch like a ghost, watching his friends chatter and laugh and act like nineteen year olds for once. He just smiled at them all. Smiled, and drank.\n\n\nEventually, the food was nothing but crumbs, and the booze was running low too. James, Sirius and Peter had the idea to summon beers from neighbouring flats via the window, and the girls were trying to convince them not to, when Remus remember what Lily had said in the kitchen.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your news?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Lily\u2019s head turned sharply towards him. She was standing by the window, arms around James\u2019s shoulders, trying to pull him away from his thieving attempts. James turned too and they shared a sheepish look.\n\n\n\u201cEveryone,\u201d James cleared his throat, \u201cUm. Lily and I have something to--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh Christ!\u201d Mary said, suddenly, from where she was lounging in the armchair opposite Remus, legs flung over the arm. \u201cLily, I thought you were on the pill!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMary!\u201d Lily turned an even deeper shade of red, \u201c\n\n\nNot\n\n\nthat!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPhew!\u201d Mary laughed, closing her eyes, \u201cBecause we\u2019re not even\n\n\ntwenty\n\n\nyet, we\u2019re much too young to be thinking about--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting married!\u201d Lily yelped, quickly, before Mary could make any further comment.\n\n\nYou could have heard a quill drop.\n\n\nRemus blinked a few times, watching James\u2019s face to check that it wasn\u2019t all a big joke. But he was beaming down at Lily with so much love and pride in those soppy brown eyes of his, that Remus simply smiled to himself.\n\n\nYes\n\n\n, he thought.\n\n\nOf course\n\n\n. Remus\u2019s second thought was Sirius, who had been half leaning out of the window when the announcement broke. Now he \u00a0spun around so fast he smacked his head on the frame.\n\n\n\u201cYou what?!\u201d He stared at James, a strange mix of surprise and displeasure plain on his face.\n\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d James grinned, oblivious, wrapping his arms around Lily. \u201cShe asked - and who was I to refuse?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nYou\n\n\nasked?\u201d Marlene poked Lily, \u201cBloody feminist hero, Evans.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was a bit more mutual than that,\u201d Lily laughed, \u201cWe were just talking, and--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut we only just left school.\u201d Sirius said, his voice dull.\n\n\n\u201cA year ago,\u201d Peter reminded him, straightening the lapels on his green-checked blazer.\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even\n\n\nlive\n\n\ntogether.\u201d Sirius folded his arms. Remus felt trapped - these were all the warning signs that Black was getting ready for a fight - except for once it was not Remus he was fighting with.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to move in with James\u2019s family for a bit,\u201d Lily said, her smile faltering as she realised that Sirius was not sharing their joy.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, you know how much they love having her around,\u201d James said. His voice had hardened, and he kept his arms around Lily as if protecting her. \u201cShe\u2019s been amazing while they\u2019ve not been well.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHave you really thought about this though?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they have, Black, chill out.\u201d Mary said, trying to lighten the mood. She got up, \u201cShall I pop out and see if we can get some cheap fizz? This deserves a toast!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Marlene stood up too. She hugged Lily then kissed James on the cheek, \u201cCongratulations you two!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCongratulations!\u201d Peter raised his beer can drunkenly.\n\n\n\u201cHave you all gone mental?!\u201d Sirius almost shouted. Remus caught the look of dismay on Lily\u2019s face and decided that was enough. He stood up.\n\n\n\u201cPadfoot.\u201d he said, firmly, using\n\n\nthat\n\n\nvoice, \u201c\n\n\nNo\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nSirius glared at him now. His mouth shut abruptly, and he tossed his head like a moody teenage girl, before pushing past them all and marching out of the room. The bedroom door slammed.\n\n\n\u201cSilly sod.\u201d Mary said breezily. \u201cI\u2019ll nip out to the shop - coming Marls?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d better\u2026\u201d Remus jerked his head in the direction of the bedroom and followed after Sirius.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t knock, just walked right in. After all; it was his flat too. Sirius was ready for him, and started as soon as Remus closed the door behind himself.\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly tell me that you think this is a good idea!\u201d He ranted, pacing the room. \u201cProngs is being ridiculous! We\u2019re too young, there\u2019s a bloody war on, his mum and dad are ill, and he wants to have a fucking wedding?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think those all sound like good enough reasons to have a fucking wedding, actually.\u201d Remus sighed, sitting down on the bed.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking! We\u2019re kids!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in love.\u201d Remus tried reasoning. Sirius laughed - a mean, cruel laugh -\n\n\n\u201cOh, and\n\n\nyou\u2019re\n\n\ngoing to start waxing lyrical about love, are you Moony?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWatch it.\u201d Remus stood up, sharply, using his height to tower over Sirius. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re being such a tosser to James and Lily, but I\u2019m not going to sit here and have you fling bitchy little comments at me.\u201d\n\n\nSirius was about to retort, when the door swung open again, and this time James barrelled in, angrier than Remus had ever seen him.\n\n\n\u201cYou dick!\u201d He yelled, \u201cWhat the fuck are you playing at?! Moony, don\u2019t defend him!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d Remus said, stepping away and crossing his arms, \u201cI was saying the same!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell?!\u201d James rounded on Sirius again, \u201cWant to explain yourself?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I want you to explain yourself!\u201d Sirius snapped, \u201cWhat the fuck?! You\u2019re getting married, just like that? I know you\u2019ve had this mad thing for Evans since you were twelve, but bloody hell! What\u2019s the rush?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a \u2018mad thing\u2019!\u201d James shouted, \u201cI love her! I\u2019ve been in love with her forever, as you well know!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo you have to get married all of a sudden?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\n\n\nwant\n\n\nto get married, and it\u2019s not sudden! We\u2019ve been talking about it for ages.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFirst I\u2019ve heard of it!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, well, I don\u2019t have to tell you everything! I didn\u2019t want to say anything until Moony was back.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat about your parents?! What do they think??\u201d Sirius was losing steam, but obviously not willing to stop being angry yet.\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re thrilled, actually! They love Lily! And I thought you did too! You\u2019re my best friend, I thought you\u2019d be supportive!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Sirius\u2019s eyes gleamed, \u201cBecause you\u2019ve always been so supportive of my relationships!\u201d\n\n\nJames\u2019s eyes flickered towards Remus, then back again - it was only a split second, but Remus definitely felt it. What the hell was\n\n\nthat\n\n\nabout?\n\n\n\u201cYou know that\u2019s not...\u201d James said, fiercely, jaw clenched.\n\n\nRemus took that as his cue to leave. Whatever was going on between the two of them, he didn\u2019t want any part in it. He went straight to the kitchen and looked under the sink. There was a bottle of firewhisky he\u2019d put there after the last party for safekeeping. He uncorked it and took a long swig.\n\n\n\u201cRemus?\u201d\n\n\nHe almost choked as Lily entered the kitchen. She laughed and reached out a hand,\n\n\n\u201cGive us some, then? Mum always said never to drink alone.\u201d\n\n\nHe laughed, wiping his mouth with the back of his sleeve and handing her the bottle. She drank deeply, and didn\u2019t wince - Remus watched her with awe and thought that if you\n\n\nhad\n\n\nto marry a girl, then she\u2019d better be exactly like Lily Evans.\n\n\n\u201cSorry I ruined your homecoming party.\u201d She said, forlorn.\n\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d Remus shook his head, \u201cSorry about Sirius.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be silly - you\u2019re not his keeper.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s being a prat.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just jealous, I knew he would be.\u201d She laughed, catching Remus\u2019s look, \u201cNot like\n\n\nthat\n\n\n, Moony, it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s madly in love with you, I mean he\u2019s worried he\u2019s going to lose his best friend.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m usually right.\u201d She raised an eyebrow at him, and he laughed again.\n\n\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said, sincerely, this time. \u201cI think it\u2019s brilliant.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks, love,\u201d she smiled softly. \u201cIt is a bit rushed, I know - my parents went spare; Pet was only married last year, and she\u2019s three years older than me. But\u2026 you know Euphemia and Monty aren\u2019t well?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I wish I could go and see them, but\u2026 Moody\u2019s orders, y\u2019know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey understand.\u201d She touched his arm gently, \u201cAnyway, they\u2019re really\u2026 I mean, they\u2019re not suffering or anything, but they\u2019re very old. I knew how much it meant to James - having them see him with me. They want to know he\u2019ll be ok when they\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\n\nMaybe he\u2019d had too much to drink, but tears pricked in Remus\u2019s eyes unexpectedly. He covered his face and groaned,\n\n\n\u201cJesus Christ, Evans, can I have five minutes without an emotional breakdown?!\u201d\n\n\nShe laughed and hugged him again,\n\n\n\u201cLovely boy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve baa-ack!\u201d Mary and Marlene sang as they stumbled into the flat once more, giggling merrily.\n\n\n\u201cHide that, quick!\u201d Lily gave Remus his bottle back, and he stowed it back under the sink behind a box of laundry powder.\n\n\nBy the time Mary had poured everyone a glass (or a mug) of babycham (\u201cthe closest thing to champagne you can get in Soho after midnight\u201d), James and Sirius had re-emerged from the bedroom, both still red faced, but apparently on better terms. Sirius joined in the toast, at least, and even gave Lily a polite kiss on the cheek.\n\n\nStill, the atmosphere had changed, and everyone left within the next hour or so - Marlene was staying over at Mary\u2019s in Croydon, Peter went back with James and Lily. When the door closed for the last time at one in the morning, Remus felt like curling up on the couch, covering his head and staying there for a week.\n\n\nSirius didn\u2019t say much, just did a bit of perfunctory tidying up, then went to the bathroom. Remus heard the lock click shut and took the opportunity for one last glass of whisky and a cigarette before bed. He felt grimy; his teeth were furry, his throat scorched and his eyes itching, but it suited his mood.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t feel like talking anymore; especially if it led to another fight. He even considered just falling asleep on the couch. But then - that might just mean a fight in the morning, and he already knew he was going to be hungover then. Only one thing for it.\n\n\nSirius unclicked the door and Remus heard him padding through to the bedroom. Maybe if Remus took his time brushing his teeth Sirius would doze off before he got there - they\u2019d both had a lot to drink. He hoisted himself off the couch and headed for the bathroom.\n\n\nRemus washed his face and the back of his neck in cold water, and stared at himself in the medicine cabinet mirror above the sink. He\u2019d been avoiding his reflection since he got back. He looked like shit; still too hollow in the cheeks, eyes darker and wider somehow. He was pale from too much drink and his scars stood out like silver wires under his skin.\n\n\nDid he have that same haunted look that they had; the pack? Had he caught that feral glint, that rangy wolfish smirk? Or was he just seeing the angry, frightened care home kid that has always been there?\n\n\nHe sighed, defeated, and flicked off the light, going to bed at last.\n\n\nThe lights were still on, and Sirius was under the covers, only his silky black hair visible, draped over the pillow. He always slept like that; hidden. With a flash of clarity Remus was reminded of the child Sirius had once been; alone in a big house full of family who couldn\u2019t understand him, the weight of expectation pressing in on all sides.\n\n\nRemus turned his loneliness inwards; always had. But Sirius - he pushed his loneliness\n\n\nout\n\n\n, and let other people take it from him. So he got a bit possessive sometimes, a bit panicky - so what? Nobody was perfect. Softening, Remus got in beside him and very gently stroked Sirius\u2019s hair.\n\n\n\u201cAll right?\u201d He whispered.\n\n\nSirius\u2019s head bobbed in a sort of nod under the duvet, and he reached out to wind his arms around Remus\u2019s waist. Remus sighed, relieved. It felt so good to be back in his own bed. They could always just\n\n\nnot fight\n\n\n, he thought to himself. \u201cLove you,\u201d he murmured, kissing the top of Sirius\u2019s head.\n\n\nSirius\u2019s arms grew tighter around him, and soon enough they both fell asleep."

It was going to be a relatively small affair - order members and school friends, mostly - and it would be held at the Potters\u2019 estate. They were hoping the weather would be nice enough to have it in the gardens, but even if it rained there was plenty of room indoors.\n\n\nAfter making such a fuss on the night of Remus\u2019s homecoming, Sirius was clearly very embarrassed by how he\u2019d acted, and made up for it by doing pretty much anything James and Lily asked of him. He ordered dress robes for the boys in Madam Malkin\u2019s, went to pick up the rings from the jeweller, and offered his entire record collection up for use at the reception.\n\n\nRemus, who had never been to a wedding, tried to stay well back. As far as he knew, his duty as groomsman was to show up, keep Sirius\u2019s head from exploding, and make sure none of Lily\u2019s muggle family saw anything too scarring.\n\n\nSirius\u2019s most bonkers act of contrition was to hand-write all of the invitations. His talent for calligraphy was still one of Sirius\u2019s darkest secrets, (and Remus\u2019s favourite thing to tease him about) but he was determined to be the perfect Best Man, so he sat hunched over the dining table one afternoon and worked at it for a solid four hours.\n\n\n\u201cFifty-eight!\u201d Sirius said, triumphantly, finishing the last invitation with a flourish of his quill.\n\n\n\u201cWell done,\u201d Remus said, glancing over the top of his newspaper, \u201cAhh, look at your pretty handwriting! So dainty!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBetter than your chicken-scratch!\u201d Sirius poked his tongue out.\n\n\n\u201cJust don\u2019t tell anyone you did them,\u201d Remus advised, \u201cOr you\u2019ll start getting requests.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you really think they\u2019re that good?\u201d Sirius asked, holding one up to the light to inspect the delicate whorls of black ink.\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re gorgeous. Really.\u201d Remus said, fondly.\n\n\n\u201cWell, this is the only time I\u2019m doing it,\u201d Sirius sniffed, tidying up the pile, \u201cThis is the one and only wedding I will ever support.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat if Mary got married? Or Pete?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d show up and get drunk, but secretly I would hate every minute.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cVery reasonable,\u201d Remus nodded.\n\n\n\u201cAnother thing you can blame the noble and most ancient house of\n\n\ncack\n\n\nfor.\u201d Sirius said, \u201cDo you know how many engagement dinners and weddings I\u2019ve been to? Ugh.\u201d He shuddered visibly. \u201cSo I\u2019m sorry, Moony, but you\u2019ll never make an honest man of me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, and I was just about to propose,\u201d Remus said dryly, getting up, \u201cTea?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPlease.\u201d Sirius nodded, rubbing his sore knuckles.\n\n\nRemus entered the kitchen, tapping the kettle with his wand - they\u2019d gone to get it the same day as the dress robes. It had reminded Remus a bit of going to get his school shoes as a boy; Ollivander measured him and \u00a0then hummed and ahhed and muttered to himself under his breath. He\u2019d rummaged about in the stock room and bought out box after box of wands for Remus to try. Eventually they\u2019d settled on a flexible cypress number, with a unicorn hair core.\n\n\nHe\u2019d been trying to get used to it. It wasn\u2019t the same as Lyall\u2019s wand (which he\u2019d found out had been blackthorn, with a kelpie hair core) - it seemed less rigid, more inclined to do what Remus told it. Which meant that Remus had to remember not to put too much force behind his magic, as he\u2019d grown used to doing.\n\n\nHe watched the steam rising from the kettle spout thoughtfully.\n\n\n\u201cIt would really piss them off, though,\u201d Remus called through the thin wall.\n\n\n\u201cWhat? Who?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYour family.\u201d Remus said, plonking two tea bags into two mugs, \u201cIf you married a bloke. A half-blood, werewolf, bloke.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget poor!\u201d Sirius laughed. \u201cMerlin, just imagine sending my mother an invitation to that!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cImagine sending\n\n\nanyone\n\n\nan invitation to that,\u201d Remus snorted, \u201cChrist, I can already hear James making horrible puns about the honey\n\n\nmoon\n\n\n.\u201d He carried the mugs of tea back through to the living room, setting them down on the coffee table.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already been engaged once, I really don\u2019t fancy doing it again.\u201d Sirius said, with an air of finality.\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah, you\u2019re welcome for that.\u201d Remus winked.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nWell, if I had a nickel, I'd find a game\n\n\n\n\nIf I won a dollar, I'd make it rain\n\n\n\n\nIf it rained an ocean, I'd drink it dry\n\n\n\n\nAnd lay me down dissatisfied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's legs to walk and thoughts to fly\n\n\n\n\nEyes to laugh and lips to cry\n\n\n\n\nA restless tongue to classify\n\n\n\n\nAll born to grow and grown to die\n\n\n\nThe wedding planning was actually a very welcome distraction, as the summer opened up before them. Sirius, James, Peter and Lily were often called out urgently for order missions, and the list of missing read out at the beginning of every meeting was growing longer.\n\n\nBenjy Fenwick, who had been working with Moody for years was horribly murdered - they couldn\u2019t even have a casket at his funeral; there wasn\u2019t enough of him left. Darius Barebones - who Remus had never liked, but who was nonetheless a dedicated agent - was found flayed alive in his own office at the ministry. They were miserable times.\n\n\nRemus was finally allowed to return to the Order officially after two full moons had passed without incident. Ferox believed that the split Castor had instigated meant that Greyback\u2019s pack was too weak to be much use to Voldemort - and somehow everyone had got the idea that Remus was responsible for this.\n\n\nDumbledore actually shook his hand, saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve done us all so proud, Mr Lupin.\u201d\n\n\nDanny McKinnon had even apologised to him - Remus thought that was probably Marlene\u2019s doing.\n\n\nBy July, the Order\u2019s numbers had dwindled so much that even Remus was getting sent out - and he was often paired with Mary, which made things bearable. Their general orders were to backup Aurors by standing guard, or managing surveillance on some of the better known death eaters. Remus and Mary spent a lot of time sitting in cafes together, or hiding behind bushes.\n\n\nOne such mission involved following a death eater called Travers, who was known to drink at a wizard\u2019s pub near Stoke Mandeville. They were just supposed to see where he went; how he spent an average day. Caradoc Dearborn, a hero of the Order of the Phoenix, had last been seen entering the pub, but no one had heard from him since.\n\n\n\u201cYou came back,\u201d Mary whispered, as they waited in the backseat of an ancient Ford Cortina, parked across the road. \u201cSo maybe Caradoc will too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI hope so.\u201d Remus replied.\n\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t bear not knowing.\u201d Mary\u2019s leg was shaking nervously, \u201cI keep imagining\u2026 and what they did to the Prewetts!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think about it.\u201d He put a hand on her knee to keep her still, and searched for a distraction, \u201cHey, did Lily decide on flowers in the end?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnything except lillies or petunias,\u201d Mary said, with a grateful smile, \u201cMe and Marls are wearing lavender, so whatever goes with that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSounds nice.\u201d Remus nodded, though he couldn\u2019t for the life of him picture the colour lavender - was it purple? Or blue?\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here with me, Remus,\u201d Mary said, \u201cI could only ever get my defensive spells right in your study groups.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just here to watch. Everything will be alright.\u201d\n\n\nThey waited for hours, and when Travers finally came out, staggering and reeking of spirits, he was not alone. Remus had to nudge Mary, who\u2019d nodded off, lolling against his shoulder.\n\n\n\u201cOh shit!\u201d She whispered, her voice hoarse with terror, \u201cSix of them, Remus!\u201d\n\n\nRemus held a finger to his lips, signalling her to be quiet. He watched the death eaters spill out of the pub onto the quiet country road. He recognised a few of them from pictures Moody had shown the order - Karkaroff, Dolohov, and Alecto Carrow. Two of them he recognised by scent.\n\n\n\u201cFuck.\u201d He said under his breath, \u201cIt\u2019s Mulciber and Snape.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Mary grabbed his arm, peering to look, \u201cOh my god! We\u2019ve got to get out of here!\u201d\n\n\nThe problem was, the car was just for show, and anyway neither of them could drive.\n\n\n\u201cStay calm,\u201d Remus said, \u201cWe\u2019ll just wait for them to go - I bet they\u2019re going to app--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOooh, muggles!\u201d Alecto Carrow, a stocky, horsey faced young woman pointed gleefully at the Cortina, \u201cLet\u2019s play!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFuck.\u201d Remus said again. The six dark robed wizards glided towards them, drawing their wands. Remus pulled his out too, Mary following suit. \u201cQuick,\u201d he said, \u201cLet\u2019s get out, maybe we can--\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nAPERIO\n\n\n!\u201d Travers whipped his wand at the car, and the doors ripped away, wrenched from their hinges with a horrible, crunching metal sound.\n\n\nMary screamed, but she kept her wand up. Remus pushed her backwards, shielding her with his body and hoping they could get out the other side. He\u2019d feel much better with a car between them and the six dangerous killers.\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not muggles!\u201d One of the death eaters said, gleefully - was it Mulciber? \u201cThey\u2019re mudbloods!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAhh even better!\u201d Alecto cackled.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nImpedimenta\n\n\n!\u201d Remus yelled, as he and Mary got free of the car.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nLoony Lupin\n\n\n, is that you?!\u201d Snape now, \u201cWhat luck!\n\n\nSectumsc\n\n\n--\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nLANGLOCK\n\n\n!\u201d Mary cried, with so much emotion that Remus heard the\n\n\nclick\n\n\nas Snape\u2019s teeth snapped shut, and he clutched his jaw with both hands, unable to speak.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nCrucio\n\n\n!\u201d Mulciber shouted, aiming at Mary, but Remus jumped in quickly with a shield charm.\n\n\n\u201cStupefy!\u201d Mary got Mulciber, but the others were still advancing, even Snape, though he was still disabled.\n\n\n\u201cQuick, Mary!\u201d Remus grabbed her hand, and they disapparated, landing just about on their feet in the middle of Cardiff town centre. Luckily it was so late there were no muggles about - except for a very drunk looking tramp, who rubbed his eyes at the sight of them.\n\n\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Mary asked, shakily, her eyes huge.\n\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Remus panted, \u201cWe need to do it again - six times to be safe, remember?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight, yes, ok,\u201d she nodded, clearly in shock. Remus realised he\u2019d have to do it again. He squeezed her hand once more, and they were in Essex, only a mile or so from St Edmund\u2019s. The landing was even harder this time, and Remus had to bend forward to stop his head spinning.\n\n\n\u201cAgain.\u201d He grunted.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d Mary took his hand, and dragged him whirling through space once more. Next they had arrived in an industrial estate somewhere, trucks and lorries parked outside big warehouses, glowing under faint yellow street lamps. \u201cUgh,\u201d Mary pressed a hand to her forehead, wincing, \u201cOk, again.\u201d\n\n\nThe fourth time, they had to cling to each other to stop from falling over. The fifth time, they landed on their backs - thankfully in a soft grassy field somewhere in the Lake District. Remus hauled himself up, his legs practically jelly, his head spinning. He pulled Mary up too, and she stumbled against him, woozy.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be sick.\u201d She said, then promptly turned around and threw up. Remus rubbed her back gently, blinking sweat out of his eyes,\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing so well,\u201d he choked, \u201cJust once more\u2026\u201d\n\n\nIt was almost dawn when they got back to London, exhausted and queasy, heads throbbing. Mary stayed at their flat, saying she couldn\u2019t go to her mum\u2019s looking so rough. Sirius summoned Moody through the fireplace, and he arrived immediately, interrogating Remus and Mary who sat shaking on the couch, wrapped in blankets and sipping weak tea.\n\n\n\u201cExcellent work, you two,\u201d He nodded to them before leaving, \u201cKeep it up, and you\u2019ll both make it through.\u201d\n\n\nMary burst into tears.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nIt was bad all round. Remus and Mary\u2019s narrow escape that night was not their last, nor were they the only ones to find themselves in a tight spot. Remus frequently had to leave the room while James and Sirius recounted their own misadventures, and Peter had developed a bit of a stammer whenever anyone mentioned death eaters.\n\n\nAll told, the wedding felt like the only bright spot in their rapidly shortening futures. They\u2019d certainly had their fill of funerals.\n\n\nSo, in late August when Remus and Sirius had an unexpected visit from Lily, who was in a state of panic, they immediately assumed the worst.\n\n\n\u201cOh, thank god you\u2019re here!\u201d She said, bursting into their living room. Her hair was up in a messy ponytail, and she looked over tired and overworked.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?!\u201d Remus stood up, quickly.\n\n\n\u201cNot you,\u201d she brushed him aside dismissively, then turned to Sirius, \u201cI need\n\n\nyou\n\n\n!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Sirius looked just as puzzled as Remus. Lily\n\n\nnever\n\n\nneeded his help. \u201c Is it Prongs?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, the bastard.\u201d\n\n\nThe worry left Sirius\u2019s face and he smirked.\n\n\n\u201cLook, if this is about the stag do\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t care what you lot get up to,\u201d she tutted impatiently, \u201cThis is much, much more important.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll put the kettle on, then\u2026\u201d Remus said, disappearing into the kitchen. He could still hear them through the wall.\n\n\n\u201cSo, what is it then?\u201d Sirius was asking.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t dance.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d He scoffed, \u201cI\u2019ve seen you dance.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I can shake my hips to pop music, but I\u2019m talking about\n\n\nproper dancing\n\n\n. With steps, and James leading, and counting \u2018one two three\u2019, the whole shebang!\u201d\n\n\nSirius was laughing, now.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be\n\n\nthat\n\n\nsort of wedding? Prongs practically promised me there would be modern music!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere will be!\u201d Lily returned, defensively, \u201cBut\u2026 well it\u2019s traditional to have a first dance, and I think his mum would like to see it. I agreed to do it ages ago; I thought \u2018fine, we\u2019ll just stick on something soppy and just sort of cling on to each other for a few minutes\u2019, but that\n\n\nwanker\n\n\njust casually mentioned the fact that he\u2019s been ballroom dancing since he could walk!\u201d\n\n\nSirius snorted,\n\n\n\u201cYep, sounds about right. Look, Evans, you\u2019re the one bonkers enough to marry a pureblood, you\u2019ve made your bed now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut you have to help me!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOhhhh no\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus re-entered the room with a tray balancing three mugs of tea.\n\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d he said, slyly, \u201cI\u2019d love to see this.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Sirius folded his arms decisively. \u201cGet Pete to do it! He\u2019s a pureblood too!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s too short,\u201d Lily shook her head, \u201cAnd\u2026 well I don\u2019t want to be mean, but he\u2019s very clumsy, and I don\u2019t want him stepping on my feet while I\u2019m breaking in my wedding shoes. They\u2019re white satin.\n\n\nPlease\n\n\n, Sirius? I\u2019m a fast learner, I swear, you just need to get me through one dance.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMoony!\u201d Sirius pleaded, as Remus sat beside him, \u201cSave me!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think you should do it,\u201d Remus replied, sipping his tea, \u201cFor James.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d Lily nodded enthusiastically, \u201cFor James!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve me.\u201d Sirius grumbled. \u201cFine.\n\n\nOne\n\n\nlesson. A waltz is easy enough. Moony, go away.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Remus sat down on the couch, settling in for the show, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you waltz before, and I\u2019m not going to miss it.\u201d\n\n\nSirius held up his middle finger, then tossed his head and turned to Lily.\n\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d he said, haughtily, \u201cGive me your hands\u2026\u201d\n\n\nAs amusing as it first seemed, fifteen minutes into the lesson Remus was completely entranced.\n\n\nSirius worked hard to hide his pure-bloodedness most of the time. Ever since they were kids, Remus had been aware of Sirius mimicking his accent, and sometimes even his mannerisms in an effort to seem less privileged. He slouched, he swore, he wore ripped jeans and leather jackets. But here was proof that Sirius Orion Black, heir to the most prestigious and ruthless magical house in Britain, had not completely forgotten his roots.\n\n\nAt the time, Remus found it charming - as he found almost everything about Sirius charming. He held his head high, showing off his long white neck and regal jawline. He took Lily in his arms like a real gentleman - like a courtly prince. When he moved, he glided; not a step out of place. He was the picture of incorruptible nobility. It drove Remus mad.\n\n\n\u201cThank you so much!\u201d Lily gushed, rather pink cheeked after two hours of dancing, \u201cI have to get back, or he\u2019ll wonder where I am, but I seriously owe you one, Black.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, just your first born will do.\u201d Sirius waved a hand gallantly, grinning. He looked like he\u2019d enjoyed himself too.\n\n\nLily grabbed her bag, kissed them both on the cheek, and left via the fireplace. Sirius turned to Remus, who was still watching him from the couch. He pulled a face,\n\n\n\u201cGo on then, take the piss\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d Remus smirked, getting up and walking over to him, \u201cI love how fancy you are.\u201d\n\n\nHe slung his arms over Sirius\u2019s shoulders and leaned in for a kiss. It went on a long time; Sirius pressing against him, affectionately at first, but then with more eagerness as the kiss deepened. Since Remus had returned from the pack things had been a bit dry in that department - not that they\u2019d been monks, exactly, but on the rare instances neither of them was exhausted, sex had become pretty functional.\n\n\nSirius grinned against Remus\u2019s lips, tilting his head back. Remus\u2019s hands were on Sirius\u2019s waist, and his thumbs found their way under the waistband of his jeans, stroking circles on his hip bones that made Sirius squirm.\n\n\nRemus grinned too, pulling back,\n\n\n\u201cWanna dance?\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nSo tell my baby, I said so long.\n\n\n\n\nTell my mother, I did no wrong -\n\n\n\n\nTell my brother to watch his own\n\n\n\n\nAnd tell my friends to mourn me none\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree days after the dancing lesson, Sirius and Remus found themselves with a miraculously free Sunday. There were no missions; there were no meetings; there were no wedding-catastrophes to solve. And as far as Remus knew, neither of them were in mortal peril. So they spent it the best way they could think of - sleeping.\n\n\nThey had the longest lie in since Hogwarts had finished, and it must have been almost twelve by the time Sirius got up to let the post-owl in - it had been angrily pecking at their bedroom window for fifteen minutes.\n\n\nThe owl hooted indignantly, circled the room, then dropped the Daily Prophet on Remus\u2019s legs, while Sirius rifled around in the bedside table for a knut to give it. Remus rolled over, groaning. He considered covering his head with the duvet and just going back to sleep.\n\n\n\u201cShall I do breakfast?\u201d Sirius asked, picking up the paper. \u201cBreakfast in bed?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHave I told you how much I love you?\u201d Remus smiled, eyes squinting open. He stretched a bit, yawning, \u201cI think we\u2019ve run out of eggs though, so--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Sirius grabbed his arm so hard he\u2019d have bruises the next day. He shoved the paper in his face, and Remus - startled and half awake - blinked at the headline.\n\n\nBLACK HEIR CONFIRMED DEAD\n\n\n\u201cEh?\u201d Remus scratched his head, confused, \u201cThat's mental, you\u2019re not--\"\n\n\nThen it hit him. Oh. He felt so stupid. He looked up at Sirius, who was white as a sheet, eyes wide and pained.\n\n\n\u201cOh\" Remus said, helplessly reaching out, \u201cOh no, Sirius\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm chained upon the face of time\n\n\n\n\nFeeling full of foolish rhyme\n\n\n\n\nThere ain't no dark till something shines\n\n\n\n\nI'm bound to leave the dark behind"

He got up, he made tea, and offered whisky, though Sirius shook his head at that.\n\n\nHe tried talking to him, but Sirius just stared at the article.\n\n\n\u201cIs there anything you need? I\u2019ll get you anything at all, just say\u2026?\u201d\n\n\nNothing. Sirius just blinked, and began re-reading from the top. There was a photograph of a tall terraced house in a posh part of London, but Remus couldn\u2019t see much else, and Sirius was clutching the newspaper so hard his knuckles turned white.\n\n\nIt was frightening. Remus stood beside him, reached out and touched his shoulder, which was as stiff as a statue\u2019s. Sirius barely reacted. Remus left the room.\n\n\nHe went to the front door, where their two jackets were hung, one soft and brown, one silver studded black leather. He reached into the pocket of the leather jacket and pulled out the silver compact mirror inside. He cracked it open,\n\n\n\u201cProngs?! Prongs!\u201d\n\n\nJames\u2019s face appeared, dark eyed and concerned,\n\n\n\u201cMoony?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt's Sirius - something\u2019s happ--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d James cut him off, \u201cI just saw the paper. I'll be two minutes.\u201d\n\n\nHe vanished, and the mirror just flashed back Remus\u2019s own distressed face. Still; that was a relief. James would know just what to do.\n\n\nRemus hated himself for thinking it, but one thing kept blaring in his mind like a foghorn;\n\n\nwas it werewolves? Was it Greyback?\n\n\nHe needed to read the article; he needed to find out as much as possible.\n\n\nThe fireplace suddenly blazed green, and James stepped through, casting around. He looked at Remus.\n\n\n\u201cBedroom.\u201d Remus said. James nodded and went straight through without a word.\n\n\nRemus closed his eyes, breathing deeply. He could make more tea. He really wanted a proper drink, but it was early in the day, and if Sirius didn\u2019t want any then it would look pretty bad if Remus started on the gin.\n\n\nFuck\n\n\n. Sirius had been\n\n\nso good\n\n\nwhen Hope died - how?! At the time Remus had taken it for granted, and now he couldn\u2019t think of a single useful thing to say or do.\n\n\nRegulus was dead. Sirius\u2019s brother was dead.\n\n\nRemus went back into the bedroom. James was sitting on the bed, an arm around Sirius, talking in his ear very low. Sirius looked as though he was only half listening as he stared into space. The paper had been dropped, finally, and lay on the floor, half under the bed.\n\n\n\u201cHe made his choice a long time ago,\u201d James was saying, \u201cYou mustn't blame yourself, you mustn\u2019t let this--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t say what happened.\u201d Sirius said, finally speaking, his voice deeper than usual, \u201cDoes anyone know? Your dad, or Moody? Was there an attack last night, or--?\u201d\n\n\nJames shook his head, arm still around Sirius,\n\n\n\u201cNo, nothing that would suggest\u2026 but of course, we could have missed something. There\u2019s evidence that he - that Voldemort\u2019s been killing death eaters. To um. To keep them in line. Some of them are having doubts, you know.\u201d\n\n\nRemus remembered the werewolves\u2019 sinister occupation. Perhaps Greyback hadn\u2019t been enough of a threat for some of the old families. Voldemort had to make an example. That made some sense. Apparently it did to Sirius, too. His eyes focussed, narrowing. He sniffed, though he hadn\u2019t shed one tear, and straightened his back, shrugging off James.\n\n\n\u201cWell then.\u201d He said brusquely, \u201cGot what he deserved, didn\u2019t he.\u201d\n\n\nJames glanced back at Remus, and they shared a worried look.\n\n\n\u201cMate,\u201d James said, \u201cHe was your brother, it\u2019s ok if--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sirius stood up, sharply, forcing James to get up too, staggering back against the wardrobe, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t my brother. They\u2019re not my family. That was always made\n\n\nvery clear\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut you--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe was my enemy. He\u2019d have killed every one of us without a second thought. So I\u2019m glad he\u2019s gone. One less Death Eater. Good. Brilliant.\u201d He looked at James and Remus, as if challenging them. Neither of them dared. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower.\u201d He said, and left the room.\n\n\nRemus gnawed his lip. James let out a heavy sigh.\n\n\n\u201cAt least he\u2019s up, I s\u2019pose. Ugh,\n\n\nRegulus, you little shit\n\n\n. It\u2019s like his final act was to mess with Sirius\u2019s head.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d Remus said, trying to see the funny side. \u201cIt feels like any time things start getting back to normal another catastrophe hits.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMoody would say \u2018that\u2019s war, lads\u2019.\u201d James replied, just as humourlessly.\n\n\nThey were quiet for a bit, and heard the boiler in the bathroom grinding as Sirius turned on the hot water. James ran his fingers through his hair, \u201cIt\u2019ll be over for good, one day. I know it will, Moony. We\u2019ve just got to do our best until then.\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded - and he did feel a bit better. James had that power; he could bring optimism to even the darkest hour.\n\n\n\u201cHow are your folks?\u201d Remus asked, aware that James had left his sick parents very suddenly.\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re ok. Mum\u2019s panicking about flower arrangements. Pete and his mum are visiting, and Lily\u2019s there, so they\u2019re not alone. I didn\u2019t tell them about this\u2026 there wasn\u2019t time, and I don\u2019t want to put any more strain on them. They\u2019d want to come over and check on him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s decided to be like this about it,\u201d Remus said, \u201cThen I think it\u2019s best not to fuss too much.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d James nodded, tiredly. He gave Remus a soft smile, \u201cYou were always right, when it came to him, eh?\u201d\n\n\nRemus shrugged, because he thought James was being awfully kind - usually Remus thought he was doing a terrible job taking care of Sirius.\n\n\n\u201cI tried to contact Moody,\u201d James continued, back to business, \u201cSee if he knows anything - but he\u2019s not answering. To be honest -\u201d James lowered his voice, leaning in to confide in Remus, \u201cI don\u2019t think Regulus was particularly high priority for anyone. It\u2019s only because he\u2019s a Black that he ended up in the paper at all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou think it was Voldemort, though? Who killed him?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSeems likely. He\u2019s getting desperate, dad reckons. No one thought the war would go on this long - it\u2019s not just our side that\u2019s flagging.\u201d\n\n\nThey went through to the living room, and Remus made more tea. They were almost out of PG tips, and he scribbled down a note to pin to their cork noticeboard which hung beside the fridge. Once they\u2019d sat down, Remus finally read the article in the paper.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nBLACK HEIR CONFIRMED DEAD\n\n\n\n\nRegulus Arcturus Black II, only child of Orion and Walpurga Black, has today been confirmed dead in a statement issued from the Black family home in Islington. Born in 1961, the heir to the Black house and fortune was eighteen years old. He had recently completed his education at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he distinguished himself as an impeccable student and gifted quidditch player.\n\n\n\n\nRegulus is survived by his parents and his cousins who will attend a private memorial service later in the week. The family have requested privacy.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\nThat was all. There wasn\u2019t much else to say about such a short life, Remus supposed, and what had been said was largely untrue, or at the very lease a smudged version of the truth. There was no mention at all of how he had died - but Remus thought that was probably a good thing; at least it definitely wasn\u2019t Greyback. The Daily Prophet wouldn\u2019t miss a chance to slip in a bit of werewolf bashing.\n\n\nSirius came into the living room, hair dripping, towel around his waist.\n\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll work on the bike, today.\u201d He said to the room, not really looking at either James or Remus, \u201cGo home, Potter, I\u2019m fine.\u201d And left again, presumably to get dressed.\n\n\nJames and Remus looked at each other again.\n\n\n\u201cWill you be ok?\u201d James asked, \u201cIf I go?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk.\u201d James hoisted himself up out of the armchair and went to the fireplace. \u201cYou have the mirror, if you need me. I\u2019ll pop back this evening.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Remus said, getting up to say goodbye. \u201cHe just needs a bit of space.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give it to him.\u201d James said, suddenly, looking Remus in the eye, \u201cMoony, I need you to keep an eye on him, ok? Don\u2019t let him go anywhere. Don\u2019t let him\u2026 don\u2019t let him try to get in touch with anyone he\u2019s related to. Except Andromeda, I s\u2019pose.\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded. That wouldn\u2019t be too hard - Sirius never spoke to his relations.\n\n\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI mean it. He might do something stupid, and we can\u2019t risk it. Plenty of people still think Sirius is\u2026 you know, untrustworthy, because of his name, and something like this is going to\u2026\u201d James pinked the bridge of his nose, as if he was getting a headache. \u201cBloody Regulus.\u201d He muttered again.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll look after him.\u201d Remus said, firmly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks, Moony,\u201d James gripped his arm, and it was as if they were thirteen again; juggling responsibility for their wayward best friend.\n\n\nJames left, and Sirius reappeared at once, as if he had been waiting.\n\n\n\u201cWere you talking about me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course we were,\u201d Remus jutted out his chin, \u201cWe\u2019re worried about you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat did Prongs say?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat I\u2019m not to let you out of my sight.\u201d\n\n\nSirius snorted, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to come to the garage, then.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Remus smiled, breezily, \u201cLead the way.\u201d He was determined to do as James had instructed - if only because he had no idea how else to be useful.\n\n\nRemus had only ever been to their shared garage once. There were a few things stored there - mainly Sirius\u2019s quidditch kit and various childhood things which wouldn\u2019t fit in the flat. And the bike, of course. It was a Triumph Bonneville T120, the same as the one Sirius had first fallen in love with years ago at the Potters\u2019. He\u2019d painted a lion on the tank, and done some kind of enlarging spell on the body.\n\n\nSirius pulled out a rag and polished it, though it was already glistening. Remus stood quietly by, watching. Sirius prodded it with his wand in a few places, oiled it in others.\n\n\n\u201cWhen do you think it\u2019ll be finished?\u201d Remus asked, finally. \u201cReady to ride?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLast week,\u201d Sirius replied, not looking up.\n\n\n\u201cYou what?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s done. Engine runs, flying function works. I\u2019m finished. I think so, anyway, haven\u2019t taken it out yet.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\nSirius just shrugged, and resumed his polishing. Remus watched him a bit longer. Obviously Sirius didn\u2019t feel like talking, and that was fair enough - Remus understood that better than most people. But he also understood the need to do\n\n\nsomething\n\n\nwhen you couldn\u2019t express yourself properly.\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, then.\u201d He said. Sirius, crouching in front of the bike rocked back on his heels and looked at Remus.\n\n\n\u201cGo? Go where?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnywhere you like,\u201d Remus shrugged, \u201cLet\u2019s take it for a spin.\u201d\n\n\nSirius blinked,\n\n\n\u201cReally? You\u2019ll come with me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019m hardly going to let you fly off on that deathtrap alone, am I?\u201d Remus laughed, \u201cWhat sort of boyfriend would I be if I didn\u2019t follow you into the jaws of certain doom?\u201d\n\n\nThe ghost of a smile flickered on Sirius\u2019s face, and he stood up.\n\n\n\u201cOk, then,\u201d he nodded, \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d\n\n\nRemus had never liked flying. He was competent on a broom these days, but it would never be his chosen form of transportation. He just didn\u2019t like heights very much.\n\n\nStill, he would do almost anything for Sirius, so he clambered onto the back seat and wrapped his arms around Sirius\u2019s waist and took lots of very deep breaths. Sirius actually laughed at him, which was progress,\n\n\n\u201cMoony, are you sure you want to do this? I can feel your heart pounding!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Remus nodded, squeezing his eyes shut as Sirius gripped the handlebars, \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve faced worse than your driving.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re sure\u2026\u201d Sirius revved the engine and Remus clung on even tighter as the seat began to rumble.\n\n\nThey went slowly at first, Sirius navigated carefully out of the garage, pointing his wand at the door so that is closed and locked behind them, then trundled slowly along the quiet back street. Then he flicked a switch, and pressed down his foot, and they sped away, Remus still trying not to look, his stomach doing backflips.\n\n\n\u201cHere we go!\u201d Sirius called out, and Remus buried his head in Sirius\u2019s shoulder as they lifted off the ground, engine roaring as they gained height. Remus felt himself sliding backwards and yelped as his tailbone hit the metal back of his seat.\n\n\n\u201cChrist\u2026\u201d he whimpered. He really was going to die. Sirius laughed again,\n\n\n\u201cWe did it, Moony!\u201d He cried, \u201cOpen your eyes you big wuss!\u201d\n\n\nRemus did, and instantly regretted it. They were a few hundred feet above the London skyline already; he could see the broad concrete rooftops and beige streets below. The people looked like tadpoles and the cars like beetles and it was\n\n\nsuch\n\n\na long way down.\n\n\n\u201cOh my god\u2026\u201d he moaned.\n\n\nSirius cheered happily\n\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing!?\u201d - he was facing forward, eyes on the horizon. It was blue skies as far as the eye could see. The wind rushed past their ears, cold and fresh, and Remus had to squint against the sun.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018mazing,\u201d he shouted back, feeling quite sick, but pleased that Sirius was happy.\n\n\nThey zoomed all over London for the better part on an hour - going as low as Sirius dared along the winding Thames, taking sharp corners around skyscrapers and almost crashing right into the dome of St Paul\u2019s. Finally, the engine began to slow, and Remus noticed they were losing height. He looked down, bravely and squinted at the unfamiliar streets below,\n\n\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIslington.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?! Sirius!\u201d\n\n\n\nShit!\n\n\nHe was supposed to be keeping him\n\n\naway\n\n\nfrom the Blacks, and now they were heading right for them!\n\n\n\u201cCalm down,\u201d Sirius replied, as they sank even further. They appeared to be aiming for a huge stretch of green space - a public park with trees and a lake and neat gravel paths around brightly coloured flower beds.\n\n\nThe landing was less than perfect. They hit the grass so hard they drove great muddy tracks in it, and Remus was finally thrown from the saddle altogether (though he was so relieved to be back on solid ground he could have kissed the grass).\n\n\n\u201cBugger,\u201d Sirius said, cutting the engine and leaping off gracefully, \u201cI\u2019ll get better at that bit - you ok?\u201d He held out a hand to help Remus up.\n\n\n\u201cFine, I think,\u201d Remus brushed his trousers and arms. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHighbury Fields.\u201d Sirius cast\n\n\nobfuscate\n\n\non the bike and then did his best to mend the ruined lawn. \u201cI used to come here a lot before I left home.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, right,\u201d Remus said, softly, \u201cWith Reg?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Sirius sniffed, \u201cOur governess brought us.\u201d\n\n\nRemus decided to store away this new revelation that Sirius had had a\n\n\ngoverness\n\n\nfor another time.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice,\u201d he said, looking around at the lush green parkland, \u201cPretty. Want to show me around?\u201d\n\n\nSirius smiled at him gratefully, and they went for a quiet Sunday afternoon walk. Here and there Sirius would stop and point something out - a tree he had climbed once, or a bridge he\u2019d hidden under. Remus enjoyed listening. He had rarely heard any happy childhood memories from Sirius, and for a little while he even forgot why they were there.\n\n\nThey stopped by the war memorial. It was particularly fancy - Remus supposed because there was a fair bit of money in Islington. Atop the white plinth stood the green hued statue of a young woman in ancient robes, holding aloft a laurel crown. An allegory for victory.\n\n\n\u201cI did my first magic here.\u201d Sirius said with a grin, \u201cWhen I was four.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally? What did you do?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSet fire to her head,\u201d he nodded at the statue. \u201cAlways been a rebel.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAmazing,\u201d Remus laughed.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, Douceline - our governess - went mad trying to put it out. But we kept laughing, me and Reggie, and every time she extinguished it I just did it again, because it made him so happy.\u201d\n\n\nSirius looked down. He was quiet for a while, and Remus just put a hand on his shoulder, to show that he didn\u2019t have to speak, if he didn\u2019t want to.\n\n\nThey looked at the plaque on the memorial.\n\n\nHow sleep the brave who sink to rest, By all their country\u2019s wishes bless\u2019d.\n\n\nRemus couldn\u2019t help but wonder about the names of the men listed below. How old had they been? Robert Fenn, Peter Cross, Arthur Hill\u2026 Had they all thought they were doing the right thing? Had they all been brave in their last moments? Had they thought of their family, their brothers?\n\n\nAnd when this war was over, would there be a plaque just like this in Diagon Alley? Whose names would it bear? Not Regulus\u2019s.\n\n\n\u201cCome on.\u201d Sirius said, finally. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go home, now.\u201d"

He thought about Livia and Castor, as he did every full moon since meeting the pack. He hoped they were both safe, and he sort of wished he had them nearby, just for the healing benefits.\n\n\nArm fixed - or as close as he could get it, he struggled to his feet and pulled on his clothes, stashed under a nearby bush.\n\n\n\u201cOk?\u201d Sirius asked, watching him warily, \u201cYou look a bit shaky.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust hurts a bit,\u201d Remus said, having to stop himself from shrugging, \u201cCan I side-along with you to get back?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course. Oi, Prongs,\u201d Sirius nudged James with his elbow, grinning, \u201cBloody good stag do, eh? Eh??\n\n\nStag\n\n\ndo?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, Padfoot, very funny,\u201d James snorted, \u201cJust as funny as the last hundred times.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wasted on you lot,\u201d Sirius sighed.\n\n\n\u201cLess than twenty-four hours to go!\u201d Peter said, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTired.\u201d James said, with a yawn. \u201cShall we?\u201d\n\n\nThey apparated back to the Potters\u2019, which was already a hive of activity. They\u2019d hired four extra house elves in preparation for the wedding the next day, and the tiny little creatures darted back and forth across the kitchen whipping up a feast.\n\n\nLily and Mrs Potter were sitting at the kitchen table - Mrs Potter in her dressing gown and slippers, which she was never out of these days. Lily jumped up to kiss James,\n\n\n\u201cMorning darling - I just stayed long enough to see you, but I\u2019ll be off now. How are you, Remus?\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded, blank and exhausted.\n\n\nLily cocked her head and tutted, \u201cGo to bed, the lot of you, you all need your beauty sleep. James, I\u2019ve left you a list of things you need to get sorted this afternoon - give me a ring when it\u2019s all finished or I\u2019ll never sleep. Sirius, did he give you the rings? Oh no, silly me, I\u2019ve got them, here you go\u2026 Remus, will you make sure he doesn't lose them? Pete, your mum popped round and I said you\u2019d gone out with the lads and were sleeping off a hangover, so better if you don\u2019t go home. I\u2019m sending Mary over this evening with the buttonholes for you all, and the ties if Madam Malkin hurries up and gets them finished\u2026 oooh, do you all have shoes?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMerlin, Evans,\u201d Sirius yawned, \u201cAnyone would think you\u2019re getting married tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\nShe stuck her tongue out at him, kissed James, hugged Remus and hurried out the door.\n\n\n\u201cGo to bed, boys!\u201d She shouted, as she left. \u201cSee you at the top of the aisle, Potter!\u201d\n\n\nRemus looked down at the list Lily had left James - it was at least fifteen inches of parchment, and Lily had small handwriting. James ignored it,\n\n\n\u201cAlright, mum?\u201d He said, going over to Mrs Potter. She had two dark smudges under her eyes, and her hair was pale and stringy. Remus was finding it hard to meet her eye, these days - she reminded him so much of his last visit with Hope.\n\n\n\u201cFine, fine,\u201d She beamed up at him, \u201cThere\u2019s so much to do!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLeave it for now,\u201d he said, an arm around her, \u201cLet\u2019s all go to bed\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat Lily,\u201d Mrs Potter said as they all made slow progress up the stairs, \u201cShe\u2019s a force to be reckoned with.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cToo right.\u201d The boys all agreed.\n\n\nRemus collapsed into bed without even taking his clothes off, and could have fallen asleep right there.\n\n\n\u201cMoony,\u201d Sirius yawned again, pulling his boots off, \u201cDon\u2019t conk out until you\u2019ve had your potion, McKinnon\u2019s orders.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMmmph.\u201d Remus groaned, rolling over and reaching for the bottle on the bedside table. Sirius clambered in beside him as he finished it.\n\n\n\u201cWhose idea was it to have a wedding right after a full moon?!\u201d He complained, another yawn encroaching.\n\n\n\u201cI told you all to just leave me to it,\u201d Remus replied, closing his eyes and flinging an arm over his face.\n\n\n\u201cAnd miss the chance to make \u2018stag do\u2019 puns for the rest of the week? No chance.\u201d\n\n\nRemus chuckled and quickly fell asleep.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nHaving never attended a wedding in his life, Remus was very grateful to Lily for having left a list. It meant he always knew what to do. However, he quickly learnt that very little about weddings made any sense at all. For example, once they\u2019d all woken up around midday, their first task was to decorate the quidditch hoops in the back garden.\n\n\n\u201cWhy are we doing this?\u201d Remus asked, frowning up at the goals, as Peter arrived levitating a crate of white flowers.\n\n\n\u201cSo they look nice,\u201d James replied, broom in hand. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way Lily would get married under them.\u201d\n\n\nRemus stared at him,\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting married under your old quidditch hoops?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know!\u201d He grinned, \u201cBrilliant, isn\u2019t?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cErr\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMoony,\u201d Sirius said quickly, \u201cYou and Pete work on the growing charm down here, Prongs and I will fly up and do the hoops.\u201d\n\n\nOnce they were finished, the three goal posts looked like a bizarre spindly rose bush had tried to take over. Next they had to decorate the nearby trees with the same flowers, and summon all of the chairs from the Potters\u2019 extensive attic, then get them to line up neatly in rows of eight. After that, Mrs Potter asked Peter and Sirius to help her with all of the crockery for the reception, and gave James and Sirius instructions to \u2018sort out the ballroom\u2019.\n\n\n\u201cBallroom?!\u201d Remus looked at james, confused. He\u2019d been visiting the Potters\u2019 for years now, and felt he knew the house pretty well - but he\u2019d never seen a ballroom.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, we don\u2019t use it much,\u201d James replied casually, \u201cKeep it in storage.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIn\u2026 storage?\u201d How on earth you \u2018stored\u2019 an entire room, Remus did not know.\n\n\n\u201cYup, I just need to remember where the instructions are\u2026\u201d\n\n\nThey went into James\u2019s dad\u2019s study, and James located a map inside one of the desk drawers. Remus got quite interested then - he would always be very fond of maps. This one was a blueprint for the Potters\u2019 mansion, which made it extra fascinating. There were all kinds of special little spells and enchantments labelled on it, but they had work to do, so he couldn\u2019t get a good look.\n\n\nThe ballroom was hidden behind the living room couch. James and Remus both had to concentrate very hard and murmur some ancient incantations to get the doors to appear. Then, of course, the couch had to be moved and the door unlocked, which was annoyingly fiddly.\n\n\nWhen James finally pushed the oak panelled double-doors open, Remus\u2019s jaw dropped. It was one of the most beautiful rooms he had ever seen; art deco marble pillars as far as the eye could see, and a glorious stained glass ceiling which cast jewel coloured patches of sunlight onto the dark hardwood floor.\n\n\n\u201cBloody hell.\u201d He swallowed, feeling very small. He remembered watching Sirius and Lily rehearsing dance steps in their tiny living room, and for the first time in a long time Remus felt very poor and grubby next to his wealthy pureblood friends.\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d James laughed, \u201cStupid, isn\u2019t it? But y\u2019know, at least we\u2019ll fit everyone in. I think we\u2019ve got thirty-three Weasleys coming already.\u201d\n\n\nFeeling a bit better, Remus set about helping James check the room, and then they conjured some mops to begin cleaning the floor. James closed the doors while they did this, so that they would not be disturbed,\n\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re not\n\n\nreally\n\n\ndoing anything,\u201d he said guiltily, leaning against a marble column, \u201cBut I just want five minutes without someone giving me an order. I wouldn\u2019t mind, but Moody\u2019s only giving us two days off for the wedding - we\u2019re expected to report for duty on Sunday.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cChrist,\u201d Remus shook his head, tutting. They stood quietly for a bit, watching the mops glide back and forth like funny skinny ballroom dancers. Remus was grateful for a breather, too. The weekend had begun with a full moon, and was only going to get more hectic as it went on.\n\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s Sirius?\u201d James asked, out of the blue.\n\n\n\u201cEh? Fine. Why?\u201d Remus frowned.\n\n\n\u201cJust checking.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou see him almost as much as I do.\u201d Remus teased him. It was true - James was much keener on the flying motorbike than Remus was, and they went for rides together almost every evening.\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d James nodded, \u201cBut he hasn\u2019t said anything about Regulus since\u2026 well, since he died.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus sighed, \u201cNo, he hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t as if Remus had been pushing Sirius to talk about it, either - but he didn\u2019t think James would understand their policy of never discussing family stuff.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like him bottling it up,\u201d James said, \u201cI know he had a complicated relationship with Reg, but it can\u2019t be normal to just pretend like he never existed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s to say what\u2019s normal?\u201d Remus countered, \u201cEveryone grieves differently.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo he\n\n\nis\n\n\ngrieving?\u201d James was giving Remus a very intense look, and it made him uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t like other people asking him about Sirius\u2019s personal stuff - that was between them.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d He lied. That seemed to work.\n\n\n\u201cGood. I\u2019ve been worried about him, it\u2019s been a shit year all round, eh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCould say that,\u201d Remus snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s about to get a lot better though. Any pre-game nerves?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d James grinned, the worry leaving his face, \u201cFeel like I\u2019ve already won the cup.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh my\n\n\ngod\n\n\nProngs, you soppy git. That\u2019s what you get for going out with girls.\u201d\n\n\nJames roared with laughter, and by the time he had regained his composure the mops had finished their task, and the floor was gleaming as if brand new.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nSaturday 8th September 1979\n\n\nThe first wedding Remus ever attended was the most beautiful and the happiest - and there was no way you could convince him otherwise. Everything went off without a hitch (well, he did have to talk an overexcited Sirius out of transforming into Padfoot to deliver the rings, but luckily it was only a fleeting mania), and it was smiles all round.\n\n\nJames\u2019s parents looked as though they would burst with pride, both appearing healthier than Remus had seen them in ages, decked out in red and gold dress robes - Gryffindor colours. Marlene and Mary made beautiful bridesmaids in simple pale mauve dresses with circlets of gypsophila in their hair, and of course Lily herself was a vision in white lace.\n\n\nIt seemed to Remus that the day flew by in a pastel hued blur. He was always supposed to be somewhere, or doing something; there was barely a moment to relax and take stock. He was very glad that he\u2019d never be getting married, because just being a groomsman was exhausting enough.\n\n\nOnce the ceremony was over and they had to start mingling, Remus found himself feeling very shy. He hadn\u2019t been around so many wizards and witches since Hogwarts - the magic in the air was palpable; muggy. It bothered him less, now. His time with Greyback\u2019s pack had taught him to cope with it, and as long as he didn\u2019t need to do magic he was fine.\n\n\nThere were plenty of people he knew, of course. He spotted the Weasley\u2019s without too much bother; Arthur and Molly were running around all over the place after their five rambunctious redheaded sons; the eldest two had decided they wanted to play quidditch with the decorated hoops now that the boring bit of the day was over.\n\n\nThen of course Moody and Hagrid and Dumbledore, and lots of other people from the Order. It was nice to see them all at a happy event, for once; it made everyone look younger. Frank and Alice were just back from their honeymoon - which Alice confided to Remus had actually involved quite a lot of work; they\u2019d gone to Slovenia on a knowledge transfer mission with the local Aurors.\n\n\nAnd of course Ferox was there. He came over to shake Remus\u2019s hand manfully,\n\n\n\u201cLooking very smart, Lupin,\u201d he nodded, and Remus felt himself blush head to toe - though he knew Sirius looked a million times better in exactly the same robes. \u201cAnd Ms. McDonald,\u201d Ferox kissed her hand, which made her blush too, \u201cVery beautiful indeed. Will it be wedding bells for you two, next?\u201d\n\n\nRemus blinked - he hadn\u2019t come out to very many people, fair enough, but he sort of though most people had cottoned on by now.\n\n\nMary laughed,\n\n\n\u201cAs if Remus would marry me! I\u2019d drive him up the wall!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh well,\u201d Ferox clapped him on the shoulder, \u201cYou\u2019re still young. Lots of wild oats to sow.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI live with Sirius,\u201d Remus said, raising his eyebrows a little bit to see if his old teacher took the hint. But apparently not. Why were grownups always so dense?\n\n\n\u201cFree wheeling bachelors, eh?\u201d Ferox laughed, gruffly.\n\n\nMary looked as though she was about to say something, but Remus caught her eye and gave the tiniest shake of his head. Not worth it.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he nodded enthusiastically at Ferox.\n\n\nAfter dinner (the best part of the day, in Remus\u2019s opinion) Lily and James cut the cake - a huge towering affair with thirteen tiers covered in buttercream icing and pink piped roses - and then the dancing began.\n\n\nLily did Sirius proud - Remus could hear him counting under his breath as he watched them; \u201cOne two three, one two three\u2026 straighten that back, Evans! Good girl\u2026\u201d\n\n\nThe waltz over and done with, someone cast an amplifying charm on the Potters\u2019 old turntable, and a Bad Company song began playing, which got all of the young people up and dancing - including Sirius, who Remus was grateful to hand over to Andromeda. Remus Lupin did not dance.\n\n\nHe was happy enough to sit by with a glass of champagne just watching, as usual. He look for Peter, who liked to dance but often lost steam after a few songs, but couldn\u2019t see him anywhere. He\u2019d probably found some friends from work and gone to chat with them. Yaz and Marlene were on the dancefloor - they were both pretty dreadful, Marene wasn\u2019t used to heels - but it was very sweet all the same. Yaz had cut her hair since leaving Hogwarts in June, and the cropped pixie look really suited her.\n\n\nMary came to Remus\u2019s rescue, in the end, as always. She hobbled over with a pained expression on her face and plonked down beside him.\n\n\n\u201cBlimey, these french knickers she\u2019s got us in go right up your bum.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCharming as ever, MacDonald,\u201d Remus smirked.\n\n\nJames and Lily whirled past them, smiling at each other like maniacs.\n\n\n\u201cLook at them,\u201d Mary sighed. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I find a bloke who loves me that much, eh? Not like I haven\u2019t been looking.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find him,\u201d Remus replied, just as happy.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll know it when I see it, that's what my mum says.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re lucky,\u201d Remus snorted. He was a bit drunker than he\u2019d initially thought, and his tongue was loose. But it was only Mary. \u201cThey say \u2018love is blind\u2019 for a reason.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI never had trouble recognising it, to be honest.\u201d Mary confided. \u201cIt\u2019s letting it in, that's the hard part.\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded in agreement, though he wasn\u2019t sure he followed. She continued, sipping her champagne. \u201cLike you did, with Sirius.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah, my freewheeling bachelor friend.\u201d Remus poked his tongue out, making Mary crease up, giggling. Remus grinned, happy to make her happy. He squeezed her knee, \u201cYou\u2019re going to fall in love one day, how could you not? Anyone would be lucky to have you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe once the war is over.\u201d She said, lowering her voice, still watching the dancing. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I could survive falling in love right now, not with everything else on top.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d Remus looked away.\n\n\n\u201cHiya,\u201d Marlene appeared, drink in hand, \u201cRemus, your boyfriend stole my partner.\u201d She nodded across the dancefloor at Sirius and Yaz, who were swinging each other around wildly, apparently unable to decide who should lead.\n\n\nRemus laughed, and Mary frowned, shifting uncomfortably in her seat. Marlene gave her a sympathetic look,\n\n\n\u201cFrench knickers?\u201d\n\n\nMary nodded, wearily. Marlene leaned in and whispered, \u201cI took mine off in the loos after the ceremony.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh my god McKinnon, you genius.\u201d Mary sat up abruptly and strode across the room towards the doors. Marlene laughed, taking her seat.\n\n\nOne of the Weasley kids came skidding past, sliding on his knees across the highly polished ballroom floor. Molly came chasing after him, panting,\n\n\n\u201cWILLIAM ARTHUR WEASLEY YOU WILL\n\n\nRUIN\n\n\nTHOSE TROUSERS!\u201d\n\n\nMarlene giggled, covering her mouth with her hand politely. She leaned in and whispered to Remus,\n\n\n\u201cI heard her tell Hattie Bones that she\u2019s pregnant\n\n\nagain\n\n\n- and she only just had twins last year!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCrikey.\u201d Remus said, developing a whole new respect for quiet and reserved Arthur Weasley.\n\n\n\u201cI reckon those two are having kids as soon as possible.\u201d Marlene nodded at James and Lily, \u201cBe very surprised if we don\u2019t get an announcement before Christmas.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEurgh, really?\u201d Remus wrinkled his nose. Weddings were one thing - they only lasted a day. But\n\n\nbabies\n\n\n?! They had to do babies, now?!\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be such a grumpy sod.\u201d Marlene gave him a sharp elbow, \u201cChange is part of life. Come on, treat me to a dance. Be nice to have a partner that\u2019s taller than me.\u201d She stood up and tugged on his wrist.\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Remus sighed. \u201cOk, but only because they haven\u2019t served the cake yet.\u201d"

Remus tried to be grateful for it; for once in his life things were quiet. He didn\u2019t get kidnapped by werewolves; there were no parents\u2019 funerals or brothers dying.\n\n\nHe tried to make himself useful to the order. Sometimes they wanted things researched - help identifying curses that the death eaters were using, or coming up with new spells that could be used against them. He occasionally worked with Alice on this, and got to know her fairly well. She was incredibly intelligent, one of the most skilled duellists Remus had ever met. He got very good at defensive charms, and spent a lot of time visiting various safehouses, setting up barriers and early warning systems.\n\n\nRemus worked hard. He threw himself into it. He had a very strong desire to be involved, to strive for something good. Maybe he was growing up. Maybe he was just sick of having no control over his own life.\n\n\nMarlene came over a few evenings a week after work. She and Remus would sit up at the kitchen table, and he would tell her as much as he could about being a werewolf - his sense of smell, his increased metabolism, and how he cared for himself during and after a full moon. He tried to be as honest as he could without getting anyone else in trouble, and she diligently took notes, asked questions and suggested improvements.\n\n\nIt was difficult for Remus, but also necessary. Marlene\u2019s earnest nature and fierce determination to improve living standards for werewolves made him feel a bit better - like he might be doing some good after all.\n\n\n\u201cWe need to get the ministry away from this idea that cells and bars are the only remedy,\u201d she would say, \u201cFrom what you\u2019ve told me, woodland is far better for the health of the subject - and we\u2019re hardly short of woodland, are we? A few protective barrier spells would do it\u2026 all we need is some creative thinking, some\n\n\ncompassion\n\n\n\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus smiled at her. Marlene made him feel like there really would be change one day. And it was nice to spend time with a friend - Sirius was so often out in the evenings on missions or at meetings.\n\n\n\u201cHow are you finding it, living with Sirius?\u201d Marlene asked one evening as she was packing up. She looked around at the dark empty flat, \u201cQuieter than my house.\u201d\n\n\nMarlene was still living with her mother and step-dad, and Danny ever since he\u2019d been bitten. More recently, Yaz had moved in too. Remus didn't know all the details, but it sounded as though Yaz\u2019s parents hadn\u2019t been thrilled when they found out about Marlene.\n\n\n\u201cIt's fine,\u201d Remus nodded, helping her collect together her notes. \u201cDifferent from school, obviously.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBet it's nice having your own space.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt can be.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you\u2026 do you two fight much? You know, with all the stress and the missions\u2026\u201d Marlene was chewing her lip now, fiddling with a strand of loose hair.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus said, reflexively; shutting down, as he always did when it came to his private life with Sirius.\n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Marlene sighed, lowering her eyes. \u201cMaybe it's just us then. Maybe because my family's around all the time.\u201d\n\n\nRemus felt a rush of sympathy for her. He touched her arm, \u201cI bet it's normal, with all the stuff everyone's been through lately. Emotions running high and all that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Marlene still sounded forlorn.\n\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Remus said, lowering his voice even though they were alone, \u201cThe only reason Sirius and I\n\n\ndon't\n\n\nargue is that we\u2019re barely ever in the same room lately. And when we\n\n\nare\n\n\nin the same room we do everything we can to avoid talking about the war, even though it's all either of us can think about.\u201d\n\n\nHe felt a rush of adrenaline having said this - he rarely spoke so openly about his feelings with anyone but Sirius.\n\n\nMarlene blinked at him tearfully,\n\n\n\u201cReally? You don\u2019t talk about it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot since Regulus died.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, of course,\u201d she nodded, softly, then wiped her eyes with her wrists, \u201cSometimes I feel like it\u2019s\n\n\nall\n\n\nme and Yaz talk about; it\u2019s exhausting. God, I can\u2019t take all this death - all this\n\n\nmisery.\n\n\nDo you know what Mary said to me the other day? She\u2019s thinking of bowing out, giving up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOn the war?!\u201d Remus stared, alarmed.\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Marlene shook her head, \u201c\n\n\nEverything\n\n\n- the wizarding world. She said she\u2019d rather just take her chances as a muggle with no education. Of course I know she didn\u2019t mean it, but I understand where she\u2019s coming from. We\u2019ve been fighting and fighting, doing everything we can and it\u2019s just not enough, is it? They\u2019re winning.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t think like that.\u201d Remus said. He really didn\u2019t want to hear this - it was awful to listen to someone he admired being so pessimistic. She was saying exactly the things that kept him up at night.\n\n\n\u201cI know, I know, we\u2019ve got to keep trying, no matter what.\u201d Marlene said, still crying quietly, \u201cBut it\u2019s taking everything I have, Remus. All I do - all\n\n\nany\n\n\nof us do is work and fight. What if\u2026 what if the war ends, and there\u2019s nothing left of me? What if I can\u2019t remember how to be happy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s bollocks,\u201d Remus shook his head vehemently, \u201cOf course you know how to be happy!\u201d\n\n\nHe went over to give her a hug. Marlene was almost as tall as he was, and her fair hair tickled his cheek.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m being silly,\u201d she sniffed, over his shoulder, \u201cJust over-tired. The nights are drawing in, it makes me gloomy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re being silly,\u201d Remus said as they pulled apart, \u201cAnd you know you have so many friends to talk to when you feel gloomy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she smiled, cheeks blotchy. \u201cThanks, Remus.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCup of tea?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I ought to get home - Yaz is stuck listening to stories of Danny\u2019s glory days with the Cannons, otherwise.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHa, go and rescue her then,\u201d Remus grinned. He wanted to ask how Danny was - but he didn\u2019t dare. They hadn\u2019t spoken properly in a year - another thing that would have to wait until the end of the war.\n\n\nMarlene said goodbye and left through the fireplace in a blaze of green flames. Remus tidied up a bit, then went to wash the ink off his hands. It had got under his fingernails and turned them black, which made him think about Livia again. He\u2019d become extremely enthusiastic about hygiene ever since he came back from the werewolves.\n\n\nHe looked out of the living room window, which was fogged up with the early winter chill. Street lamps were flickering on, glowing yellow in the blue twilight - except the one outside their window, which was faulty and stayed pinkish-red all night. With Marlene gone, Remus was gripped with a terrible aching loneliness. He fetched his scarf and jacket and headed out the door.\n\n\nThe garage door was open as he approached from the dark alleyway, light pouring out onto the uneven cracked pavement. As he got closer, he could hear the radio playing softly - a Stranglers song;\n\n\n\u201cAnd it sounds like an empty house, standing still...\u201d\n\n\n\nSirius was singing along, under his breath, like he was concentrating hard. When Remus was finally at the threshold he found Sirius cross-legged on the floor in front of his bike, wand behind one ear, spanner in hand. The garage was conspicuously warm, for winter, but Remus couldn\u2019t see where he\u2019d cast the heat charm. Perhaps on the floor itself.\n\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d he said. Sirius looked up, surprised.\n\n\n\u201cHello, what are you doing here?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMarlene left,\u201d Remus shrugged, \u201cThought I\u2019d just pop down and see what you\u2019re up to.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSame old. Just tinkering.\u201d Sirius said.\n\n\n\u201cOh, ok.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...sit down for a bit, if you like. I\u2019m nearly finished.\u201d Sirius gestured to a stool in the corner of the garage.\n\n\n\u201cOnly if I\u2019m not in your way.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d Sirius flashed him a smile, and Remus sat.\n\n\nHe watched Sirius working for a while, fascinated. Remus knew nothing about mechanics - muggle or magic - and it made him feel weirdly proud that Sirius was clearly so skilled. He liked that feeling.\n\n\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d He asked, thinking of the conversation with Marlene.\n\n\n\u201cEh? Fine.\u201d Sirius didn\u2019t look up, wand between his teeth now as he fiddled with the engine.\n\n\n\u201cNo, I mean really.\u201d Remus pushed, \u201cAre you ok? Just in general? Don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve asked much lately.\u201d\n\n\nSirius looked at him, and set down his wand.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Remus,\u201d he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut I love worrying,\u201d Remus poked his tongue out.\n\n\nSirius grunted with laughter and returned to his work, \u201cHow are you?\u201d He asked.\n\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d Remus nodded, before re-thinking, \u201cWell, you know. As good as it\u2019s possible to be, right now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm. Do you fancy a takeaway for dinner? I don\u2019t want to cook.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, ok.\u201d Remus agreed. He waited quietly. There was a stack of boxes to his left. All of Sirius\u2019s things were packed into big mahogany trunks with scorch marks where he\u2019d burnt the Black family crest off. But the boxes next to Remus were cardboard and held together with brown muggle tape.\n\n\n\u201cWhat are these?\u201d He asked, picking at the tape. Sirius looked up, wiping his hands on an old dishcloth,\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 those are the boxes from Gethin.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Remus stood up to get a better look. Sirius bit his lip, looking nervous.\n\n\n\u201cI know you said to get rid of the stuff your mum left you, but\u2026 well you weren\u2019t in any state to talk about it after the funeral, and I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of you regretting it. So James and I went to collect them, and I\u2019ve just had it all here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you,\u201d Remus said, stunned. Sirius climbed to his feet hurriedly,\n\n\n\u201cMoony, I\u2019m sorry, it wasn\u2019t meant to be a secret or anything, I swear! It\u2019s just that after your mum passed away it was one disaster after the other, so it sort of slipped my mind\u2026 and you can still get rid of them, if you want to, I haven\u2019t looked!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSirius,\u201d Remus shook his head, smiling, \u201cI mean I\n\n\ncan\u2019t believe\n\n\nyou. You\u2019re amazing. Thank you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Sirius smiled too, scratching behind his ear bashfully, \u201cThat\u2019s good. Because you had so little time with her, I thought you\u2019d want something to remember her by. Do you want to look now?\u201d\n\n\nRemus thought about it. Shook his head.\n\n\n\u201cNot just yet. Maybe on a rainy day.\u201d\n\n\nHe helped Sirius collect everything up, and they walked back to the flat, stopping at the pie shop on the way. Sirius liked chicken and mushroom, Remus preferred steak and onion. He carried the paper bag, to be gallant.\n\n\n\u201cSeriously,\u201d He said, as they climbed the stairs to the flat, \u201cThank you so much for the boxes. I\u2019d have forgotten all about them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cS\u2019ok,\u201d Sirius shrugged, \u201cI know if I had anything of Reg\u2019s\u2026\u201d he stopped abruptly.\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t know what to say, so he kept quiet as Sirius unlocked the door and entered the flat, switching the lights on and complaining, \u201cBloody hell, Moony, it\u2019s freezing in here!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry!\u201d He tended to run hot, even in winter, and didn\u2019t turn the heating on if he was the only one in the flat. He felt very stupid now, remembering that Marlene had kept her gloves on the whole time she'd been there and it hadn\u2019t even occurred to him to ask why.\n\n\nSirius lit a fire, and Remus went to get plates for their dinner. They sat on the couch, leaning shoulder to shoulder and listening to the new album by The Police, which Andromeda had sent for Sirius\u2019s birthday.\n\n\nWhen they\u2019d finished eating, Sirius rested his head on Remus\u2019s shoulder and closed his eyes, settling in. Remus sent the plates to the kitchen and raised his arm for Sirius to fit under. Warm, well fed and relaxed, he could have fallen asleep just like that.\n\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s Marls?\u201d Sirius murmured after a little while.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, fine. A bit down.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDown?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just having a hard time with the war.\u201d Remus felt butterflies in his stomach, but continued bravely, \u201cI think we all are, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\nSirius was quiet for a bit, and Remus couldn\u2019t see his face, only the top of his head, but he knew he was thinking. Finally, he whispered,\n\n\n\u201cYeah. We are.\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nFriday 21st December 1979\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly a breakthrough - they still didn\u2019t talk about the war any more than they really needed to - but it felt good enough at the time. And while it felt cathartic to admit that they were both struggling, there was nothing that could be done to improve things. People were still dying, the death eaters were still gaining power, Sirius and James were still super heroes.\n\n\nAs Christmas approached, no one felt very merry. They would not be spending the day at the Potters\u2019 this year - in early December both of James\u2019s parents were admitted to St Mungo\u2019s. They\u2019d contracted dragon pox, which was so contagious it meant that just visiting them was a mission in itself.\n\n\nWhen Sirius heard the diagnosis he locked himself in the bathroom for two hours. Remus did a bit of research and found out why - elderly people rarely survived the disease. So that became another thing they didn\u2019t talk about.\n\n\nJames practically lived at the hospital, when he wasn\u2019t meeting with Moody or on an assignment somewhere. Lily told Remus that he\u2019d had to pick up a lot of Fleamont\u2019s work, and that he was up until the small hours every night working in his father\u2019s study.\n\n\n\u201cI wish I could help him,\u201d she said mournfully, \u201cHe\u2019s not ready to lose them yet, it\u2019s too cruel.\u201d\n\n\nRemus agreed. In what sort of a world could people like Voldemort and Greyback live while Mr and Mrs Potter died?\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t realise how dark things had become until late December, when he got an unexpected phone call.\n\n\nSirius was out - he and James had been sent to West Cork to follow up on some reports of a black magic ritual taking place. Remus had been alone all day, trying to distract himself as each minute crawled by with no news. Sirius had left him his compact mirror, in case anything happened, and Remus had spent the past hour staring at it.\n\n\nWhen the phone rang he practically jumped out of his skin, then leapt to answer it.\n\n\n\u201cHello?!\u201d Logically he knew it couldn\u2019t be bad news - wizards never used phones if they could help it - but his voice shook all the same.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Ello!\u201d A voice boomed - it was so cheerful it couldn\u2019t possibly be anyone Remus knew. Must be a wrong number.\n\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d Remus frowned, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I think you have--\u201d\n\n\n\u201c--Reeeeemus!\u201d Grant sang down the phone. He sounded drunk, and there was a lot of noise behind him, \u201cCome down to the Sawyer\u2019s Arms!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere's that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBloomsbury! Come onnnn! We\u2019re all celebrating!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCelebrating? What? With who?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy mates!\u201d\n\n\nRemus felt a sinking feeling.\n\n\n\u201c...ok, give me an hour.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWeeeeeey!\u201d Grant hung up abruptly.\n\n\nRemus got up to change his clothes.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t want to go. Not where there were muggles. Not where there were\n\n\npeople\n\n\n, but Grant was definitely drunk, and the last time Remus had seen him drunk he had needed help. He sounded perky enough on the phone, but Remus wanted to be sure. Besides. He needed a distraction; he couldn\u2019t sit about in the flat all evening.\n\n\nHe shoved the mirror in his jeans pocket, pulled on a jumper, then his coat and scarf, and headed out into the wintry London streets. He got the tube to Holborn; the streets were too busy with Christmas revellers to apparate safely, and he wanted to take a convincing amount of time to arrive.\n\n\nThe Sawyer\u2019s Arms was a proper old man\u2019s pub; thick red and yellow carpet, etched glass windows, grimy brass fixtures. It was foggy inside with cigarette smoke, but Remus managed to track Grant down without much bother - he was sitting in a large corner booth, surrounded by a group of young people who looked about their age. Ah, Remus realised - they were\n\n\nstudents\n\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cReeee-musssss!\u201d Grant cheered, raising both arms in greeting as Remus entered the pub. \u201cYou caaaaame!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d Remus said, shyly. The people sitting at Grant\u2019s table all looked friendly enough, but they were still strangers.\n\n\n\u201cLads,\u201d Grant slurred loudly, addressing the group of men and women, \u201cThis is Remusss, my very\n\n\noldest\n\n\nfriend. \u2018E went to a posh private school an\u2019 evvvry-fin\u2019. Dead clever.\u201d\n\n\nRemus waved awkwardly at everyone, then turned to Grant, \u201cI see you\u2019ve been celebrating.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cToo bloody right! \u2018Ere, got you a pint.\u201d He pushed a glass across the table, and it slid a bit fast, the table slick with spilled beer. Remus darted forward to grab the drink before it flew off the edge.\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he raised it slightly, then drank. Ah. It had been a while since he\u2019d been in a pub. The lager went down very smoothly.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re celebratin\u2019!\u201d Grant said, beaming at him, \u201cEnd of exams, innit!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, congratulations,\u201d Remus smiled, pulling up a stool and perching on the end of the table. \u201cWhat do you all study?\u201d\n\n\nThey went around introducing themselves - Remus was never going to remember everyone\u2019s name - Suzie was doing Accountancy - she was a small, mousy girl with huge round glasses and a pimple on the end of her nose. Rajesh wanted to study Engineering at Kings, but he needed to get a better Maths result first, Tim - a tall, blokey man in a rugby shirt - was doing social studies. Martine was Tim\u2019s girlfriend, studying for her nursing qualification. They were all pretty tipsy, but Grant was drunkest of all.\n\n\nRemus introduced himself as best he could - he told them he was studying ancient languages, because he was actually very good at Runes, and rarely got the opportunity to show off about it. He needn\u2019t have worried about Grant - these new friends were a world away from the sort he\u2019d been mixing with a few years ago.\n\n\nThe drinks kept coming, too. Remus tried to be polite, and turn down each round, but it was no good - everyone was in a Christmas mood. Three beers in, so was Remus. The pub music alternated between Slade, Wizard, Cliff Richards and Shakin\u2019 Stevens, there was tinsel hanging from the sconces on the walls, and even the barmen were wearing party hats. Remus had half forgotten about the season - there was no time for this sort of fun any more.\n\n\nAt about half-eight he heard a voice in his pocket, and hurried into the gent\u2019s to check the mirror. It was Sirius.\n\n\n\u201cAll\u2019s well,\u201d he said, looking very ruffled, black smudges streaking his face, \u201cBoth ended up covered in ash, though - don\u2019t ask - going to wash off at Prongs\u2019 then have something to eat - be a while yet.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAs long as you\u2019re ok!\u201d Remus said, earnestly.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re fine,\u201d Sirius nodded gravely. Then he frowned, peering up at Remus through the mirror. \u201cWhere are you? At home?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPub.\u201d Remus said, guiltily.\n\n\n\u201cWith Mary?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, with\u2026 um. With Grant. He\u2019s celebrating the end of exams.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, celebrating.\u201d Sirius\u2019s face turned stony.\n\n\n\u201cI got invited out, that\u2019s all.\u201d Remus said, \u201cI was going mad in the flat by myself.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk, Moony,\u201d Sirius gave him an odd look, \u201cHave fun.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can come to Prongs\u2019 if you wan--\u201d Remus started, but Sirius\u2019s face had gone.\n\n\nRemus left the loo\u2019s and ordered a round for everyone. He didn\u2019t have any money, so he cast a glamour on a scrap of paper he found in his pocket, and the barman thought it was a twenty pound note - he even gave Remus change.\n\n\nIf Sirius was allowed to stay at James\u2019s and have a nice dinner and take his sweet time getting home, then Remus didn\u2019t see why he shouldn\u2019t be allowed to get steaming drunk in the pub with a bunch of muggles.\n\n\nThey stayed for a few more hours, talking about TV and music and clothes and films, and other gloriously mundane muggle things. Eventually, one by one, the others said their goodbyes and left.\n\n\nSuzie was the last to get up. She whispered to Remus, \u201cWill you make sure he gets home ok?\u201d Nodding at Grant, who had fallen under the table looking for his bus pass, and was now sitting on the floor giggling to himself.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, no worries,\u201d Remus nodded, feeling a bit giggly himself.\n\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas, Remus, it was lovely to meet you,\u201d she smiled, pulling on her coat.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, you too.\u201d\n\n\nOnce she\u2019d left, Remus knocked back the dregs of his pint and decided that would be it. \u201cOi,\u201d he gave a gentle kick under the table, \u201cC\u2019mon, you, time to go.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNah, let's stay out!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow many have you had?\u201d Remus asked, hands on his hips. He was feeling pretty tipsy, and Remus's tolerance was higher than most.\n\n\n\u201cA few,\u201d Grant said, pulling himself up, shaking the whole table. Remus got a hand under his elbow to steady him, and began to guide him towards the doors.\n\n\n\u201cWhere are you living these days?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know where,\u201d Grant hiccupped, \u201cBrighton.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBrighton?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, s'fine, just stick me on the last train.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Remus said, \u201cYou\u2019ll get arrested or something. Come on, you can kip on my couch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAwww,\u201d Grant grinned.\n\n\nThey staggered onto the tube together, and at Leicester Square the escalator was switched off, so they had to climb it, and were breathless by the time they reached ground level.\n\n\n\u201cI need a fag,\u201d Remus gasped, patting his pockets for his cigarette case.\n\n\nHis fingers brushed against the compact mirror instead, and he felt a quiet twinge of dread as he wondered whether Sirius was home. Not that anything untoward was going on - he just didn't want to start the fight that was brewing\n\n\njust\n\n\nyet.\n\n\nGiving up on the cigarette, he steered Grant towards Chinatown. The streets were still quite busy, light and laughter spilling out from the soho bars and sleazy picturehouses.\n\n\n\u201cWhaddidya think of Tim?\u201d Grant slurred, leaning heavily against Remus, \u201cReckon I\u2019m in wiv a chance?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI thought he was seeing Martine?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPffft.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s er\u2026 very tall?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\u2018E\u2019s strong,\u201d Grant said, decisively, \u201cLike me a strong bloke. S\u2019how I know you an\u2019 me\u2019d never work out.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOi!\u201d Remus took umbrage, \u201cI\u2019m stronger than I look!\u201d\n\n\nGrant scoffed at him, laughing, and Remus was drunk enough to take this as a challenge to his manhood. He didn\u2019t often go in for displays of masculine bravado, but maybe the beer was having some influence. Acting quickly, and barely thinking, he bent and grabbed Grant around the legs, lifting him up and hauling him over his shoulder.\n\n\nGrant was yelping and spluttering with laughter as Remus jogged with him a good few yards,\n\n\n\u201cPut me down!\u201d He shrieked, \u201cYou\u2019ve proved your point, you\u2019re very strong!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I needed to hear,\u201d Remus smirked, stopping to set Grant down, carefully. Still unsteady on his feet, Grant grasped Remus\u2019s shoulder for support, choking laughter and grinning madly.\n\n\n\u201cOoo-ooooh, what\u2019s this then?\u201d A nasty, sneering voice came from behind them.\n\n\nGrant stiffened, and his back straightened; he stared forward and lowered his head, making to ignore the danger brewing, but Remus was a bit pissed, and couldn\u2019t help looking back.\n\n\nThree men were approaching, their faces were cast into shadow by the unreliable streetlights and tall buildings, but their body language could not be misread; the rounded shoulders, balled up fists and wide gait. Masculine bravado.\n\n\n\u201cIgnore them,\u201d Grant breathed, his lips barely moving, \u201cCome on, quick.\u201d\n\n\nBut Remus had never been very good at running away from a threat.\n\n\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d\n\n\nThe men sniggered meanly, still advancing. One spoke to another, as if Grant and Remus were deaf - or just not worth addressing at all.\n\n\n\u201cLooks like a couple\u2019a nancy boys to me, couple\u2019a dirty queers out looking for trouble.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re looking for trouble,\u201d another said, \u201cI know where they can get it.\u201d He slammed his fist into his open hand, as if to demonstrate.\n\n\n\u201cRemus\u2026\u201d Grant hissed, tugging on his coat, \u201cCome\n\n\non\n\n\n!\u201d\n\n\nRemus ignored him. He faced the three men, and raised his chin. Using his very politest private-school voice, he said,\n\n\n\u201cMove along, gentlemen, before I do something you\u2019ll regret.\u201d\n\n\nThe men crowed with laughter, and did not move alone. Remus was glad. His lips curled, he shifted position, legs apart, and stared them down. With a slight turn of his wrist, they froze to the spot. It took them a second to realise what had happened, their gormless faces now visible in the red light of a neon \u2018SEXXX\u2019 sign flashing in the shop window next to them.\n\n\nThey stared at each other, tried to move their legs, but were fixed in place, as if they\u2019d stepped into quick-setting concrete.\n\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d One of them grunted angrily.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be scared, boys,\u201d Remus grinned, rather enjoying himself, \u201cI don\u2019t bite. Often.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna fucking batter ya, yer poof!\u201d One of the men yelled, \u201cI\u2019m gonna beat the piss out of ya!\u201d\n\n\nThat gave Remus an excellent idea. He snapped his fingers quickly, and watched the men\u2019s faces. One by one, a look of horror crossed each of them, and Remus caught the scent moments before their jeans began to visibly darken.\n\n\n\u201cPoor loves,\u201d Remus chuckled. Even Grant stopped tugging his sleeve, then, and stared in disbelief.\n\n\n\u201cHave you\n\n\npissed\n\n\nyourselves?!\u201d\n\n\nThe three humiliated men started shouting insults then - each one worse than the last, but it didn\u2019t matter. Remus and Grant were both practically hysterical.\n\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Remus said, slinging an arm around Grant\u2019s shoulder, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\n\nHe did not release them until they were two streets away, locked inside the flat.\n\n\nIt was hugely risky, doing magic on a busy street in central London in front of muggles. But remus couldn\u2019t work himself up to feel guilty about it; he was jubilant. It didn't seem like Grant understood what had happened - he was pretty drunk, and mostly just relieved to be safe, so Remus thought he\u2019d got away with it. Back in the flat he cracked out the whisky to toast his own success - this was met with roaring approval from Grant.\n\n\nSirius wasn\u2019t back yet, and Remus decided not to care about that, either. Most likely he\u2019d decided to stay at the Potters\u2019 for the night. Remus dug out some blankets and pillows to make up a bed on the couch for Grant, and then they settled in for another few hours of drinking and smoking and laughing. Time began to warp; stretching and contracting the more intoxicated Remus grew.\n\n\nIt must have been almost two in the morning when they hit the bottom of the bottle. Remus ran his finger around the bottom of his glass tumbler, then sucked it.\n\n\n\u201cUngh.\u201d Grant whined from the sofa, \u201cGotta give up the booze. New year\u2019s resolution.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHa.\u201d Remus barked, slouching down in his armchair, rolling a cigarette.\n\n\n\u201cRemusss?\u201d Grant asked, dopily, his head lolling over the arm of the couch, blonde curls tumbling back from his upside-down face.\n\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Remus slurred in response.\n\n\n\u201cCan I ask you summink?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\u2018ave you got a plan?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA plan?\u201d Remus frowned, confused and bleary.\n\n\n\u201cFor what you\u2019re gonna do wiv your life, y\u2019know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Remus scratched his head, arms slow and heavy. \u201cI dunno. You?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDunno.\u201d Grant sighed. \u201cBeen thinking. Maybe I wanna just find a girl or summink. Get married.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGet\n\n\nmarried\n\n\n?!\u201d Remus choked. \u201cChrist, you\u2019re pissed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt might not be awful!\u201d Grant defended himself, \u201cDon\u2019t mind spending time wiv girls. They can be fun.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026 y\u2019know, if you got married you\u2019d be expected to...\u201d Remus gestured delicately. Grant snorted.\n\n\n\u201cShe might not wanna do it much. Anyway, might not hate it. Never given it a try, \u2018ave I?\u201d\n\n\nRemus put his fag between his teeth, thoughtfully. \u201cI did, once.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Grant sat up interested, \u201cAnd?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was ok.\u201d He shrugged, lighting up. \u201cNot much to say about it really. Mostly just embarrassing. But we\u2019re still friends and stuff.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t be that bad then.\u201d Grant sighed, leaning back once more. He looked sad, and Remus wished he knew how to cheer him up. Grant reached his hand out towards Remus, who sighed and handed him the newly lit cigarette. He began to roll another.\n\n\nGrant sighed, rolling his head back and blowing plumes of smoke up at the ceiling. \u201cThey just always let me down, that\u2019s all. Men.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot always,\u201d Remus said, not liking the melancholy turn things were taking.\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Grant replied wistfully, glancing up, meeting Remus\u2019s eye, \u201cNo, I s\u2019pose you never did.\u201d\n\n\nRemus felt a flutter of warm pleasure at that - though maybe it was because he was just so drunk. Grant was still staring at him intensely, and smiling a bit now. Something passed between them. A very small thing; but something.\n\n\nThe door opened and Sirius entered, bringing the winter chill in with him. He stopped in his tracks when he saw Grant, who scrambled to sit up right.\n\n\n\u201c...hello.\u201d Sirius said, eyes darting back and forth cautiously. Remus never had guests over - let alone muggles.\n\n\n\u201cHiya mate!\u201d Grant stood up quickly, extending a hand across the coffee table, the empty whisky bottle on top. Sirius shook it, politely.\n\n\n\u201cGrant\u2019s celebrating the end of his exams,\u201d Remus explained, feeling guilty but not sure why.\n\n\n\u201cOh, congratulations,\u201d Sirius nodded, his expression guarded.\n\n\n\u201cCheers!\u201d Grant grinned, \u201c\u2018ave a drink? Oh bugger, we\u2019ve \u2018ad it all...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Sirius folded his arms across his chest and raised an eyebrow, putting on his bored aristocrat routine. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201d\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t give Remus so much as a second glance, just walked though the living room, down the hall to the bedroom.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Ave I got you in trouble?\u201d Grant whispered. Remus shook his head,\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just tired. I\u2019d better\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah, \u2018course. I\u2019m knackered, anyway - thanks again for letting me stay.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAny time.\u201d Remus smiled, meaning it, \u201cThanks for inviting me out. I really needed it.\u201d He patted Grant\u2019s shoulder as he left.\n\n\nSirius was undressing. He ignored Remus, who closed the door quietly behind himself and sat on the end of the bed.\n\n\n\u201cHow did the mission go?\u201d He asked, gently, \u201cIs James--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA muggle in the flat, Remus?!\u201d Sirius snapped, \u201cDid you even\n\n\nthink\n\n\nabout the danger?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat danger?\u201d Remus frowned, confused.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a war on! This place is supposed to be a safe house, it\u2019s supposed to be locked down tighter than Gringotts!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFunny.\u201d Remus said, flatly, \u201cI thought it was supposed to be our home.\u201d\n\n\nSirius didn\u2019t respond, just glowered, tying the string on his pyjama bottoms. Remus rubbed the back of his neck, sighing, \u201cLook, he lives in Brighton; I couldn\u2019t have just abandoned him at a train station, he was plastered.\u201d Remus tried to explain.\n\n\n\u201cSo the solution was to get even more plastered?\u201d Sirius shot back.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nSonoro Quiescis\n\n\n.\u201d Remus said, casting a silencing charm on the bedroom - the first time they\u2019d needed it since Hogwarts. \u201cIf you want a fight,\u201d he said, stretching his arms out invitingly, \u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019m more than happy to oblige.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight, I want to sleep.\u201d Sirius said.\n\n\n\u201cOk, fine.\u201d Remus shrugged. He pulled off his jumper, t-shirt coming with it, and began changing for bed too. Sirius got in under the duvet and watched him, still scowling. He definitely did want a fight.\n\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t\n\n\nbelieve\n\n\nyou just went out to get pissed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas.\u201d Remus muttered, \u201cSorry if I wanted to squeeze a tiny bit of joy out of the season.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t wait, could you? The second I left the house you had to--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re\n\n\nalways\n\n\nleaving! Am I supposed to sit around worrying myself sick all night?! I still exist when you\u2019re not here, you know, I still need to talk to people sometimes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHa!\u201d Sirius scoffed, \u201c\n\n\nYou\n\n\nwant someone to pour your heart out to, all of a sudden? That\u2019s rich.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGo fuck yourself!\u201d Remus yelled at the top of his voice.\n\n\n\u201cGo and fuck your muggle! That\u2019s obviously what he\u2019s here for!\u201d Sirius shot back. Remus reeled as if he\u2019d been struck. He stared at Sirius, and saw the hurt in his eyes. Was this all just boring old run-of-the-mill jealousy?\n\n\nRemus forced himself to relax, to lower his shoulders and unclench his jaw. He closed his eyes, breathing in.\n\n\n\u201cGrant\u2019s on the couch because he\u2019s my friend and I didn\u2019t want any harm to come to him.\u201d He said, very steadily. \u201cAnd I\u2019m in here with you, because there\u2019s nobody else I\u2019d rather be in a room with. Even when you\u2019re being a massive tosser.\u201d\n\n\nSirius\u2019s lips pursed, then relaxed. He looked very much like he wanted to keep arguing, but had nothing left to say. In the end he just slumped back in the bed, arms folded, and said to the ceiling,\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nYou\u2019re\n\n\na massive tosser.\u201d\n\n\nRemus laughed, finished changing, and climbed onto the bed, crawling towards Sirius.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\n\n\nyour\n\n\nmassive tosser.\u201d He reached up for the edge of the duvet and pulled it down, peeling it back from Sirius\u2019s body. Sirius allowed it, watching Remus, who started to untangle the knot of string on Sirius\u2019s pyjama bottoms. He pulled those down next, and licked his lips. \u201cLet me make it up to you?\u201d\n\n\nSirius bit his lip, nodded, then arched his back, and they didn\u2019t speak again for hours.\n\n\nIn the morning, Grant had gone."

            "content": "You know I'm born to lose,\n\n\n\n\nand gambling's for fools.\n\n\n\n\nBut that's the way I like it baby\n\n\n\n\nI don't wanna live forever\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat January, just over a year after his mother\u2019s funeral, Remus attended another memorial service - this time for Fleamont and Euphemia Potter.\n\n\nThey passed away within hours of each other in the final bleak days of December. Their loss was felt immensely, and not only by the members of the Order. The Potter mansion was full for weeks with visitors, mourners and old friends, and every one of them had a story of some kindness James\u2019s parents had performed.\n\n\n\u201cEuphemia always said I could ask her\n\n\nanything\n\n\nwhen I saw her at St Mungo\u2019s.\u201d Marlene sobbed, \u201cShe was such a brilliant healer, I wish I\u2019d known her longer.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey were so kind to us after we eloped,\u201d Andromeda said, holding Ted\u2019s hand and bouncing her daughter on her hip, \u201cChecked in on us all the time, made sure we never struggled for anything\u2026 I just can\u2019t believe they\u2019re gone\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf our home is even half as welcoming as theirs, I\u2019ll be proud.\u201d Arthur Weasley added, cleaning his glasses, which had grown misty.\n\n\n\u201cThe very best of wizard kind,\u201d Dumbledore intoned in the speech he gave at the service. \u201cA beacon of understanding, tolerance, good humour and community - all those values we hold most dear.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSort of fitting to have them go at Christmas,\u201d one wizened old crone said at the wake, \u201cAlways loved coming to the Potters\u2019 boxing day party.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll miss Effie\u2019s mince pies!\u201d An old man added.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll miss Monty\u2019s home brew!\u201d Another cackled. A smatter of fond laughter, followed by tender silence as everyone recalled the Potters\u2019 limitless hospitality.\n\n\nRemus kept his own memories of the Potters to himself, because he felt he had the least claim on them. Still, he would never forget that it was they who had taken him in when he\u2019d found himself homeless at seventeen, and they who had helped him locate his mother.\n\n\nIn a way it was different from the earlier deaths in the Order, because the Potters had died at an advanced age, and they hadn\u2019t been murdered - so there was more room for happy memories.\n\n\nIt still didn\u2019t feel very fair. Time is meaningless, when it comes to the people you love, Remus reflected. Eleven months had not been enough time with Hope - and twenty years had probably not been enough for James.\n\n\nSirius, Peter and Remus silently made the decision to pull together for James. He had been the source of the marauders\u2019 strength ever since they were children; had selflessly defended or supported each of them at one time or another, and there was no question that they return the favour now, in his darkest hour.\n\n\nThey took up the task of greeting as many of the droppers-by as possible, and keeping them away from James, who had quite enough to deal with. For a solid two weeks, the three of them spent their days accepting bunches of flowers and pots of home cooking (which was useful, because Gully the house elf had been inconsolable, and spent his time curled up under the aga sobbing and drinking butterbeer). Lily handled everything financial or legal - Remus couldn\u2019t help but admire how quickly she took to wizard property law - while Alice and Molly helped her manage the house and pack up the things which needed to be packed up.\n\n\nIt was grimly fitting that 1980 began with death. Years later, it would mark a turning point in the war for Remus; as if losing the Potters had shaken the very foundations of reality. After their funeral less and less things began to make sense. Things he had once felt sure of became uncertain, and the - already small - circle of people he trusted and loved began to shrink further.\n\n\nFor the rest of January, Sirius and Remus passed each other like ships in the night - one would be up late, the other awake with the dawn for some mission or other. They were both determined to make up the slack for James, and it kept them busier than ever. One or both of them might sleep at the Potters one night, or else stay with someone else in the order, for safety's sake.\n\n\nMourning Fleamont and Euphemia on top of all that meant that the short hours they did spend together were filled with silence.\n\n\nSirius had cried, the day the found out. They both had, but the pain was more raw for Sirius,\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair! It\u2019s not fair!\u201d He repeated over and over, eyes wild and desperate.\n\n\nRemus carefully put his own grief aside in order to be the stronger one, and found that things were easier when he focussed his attention on helping Sirius.\n\n\nIt was very hard work, and for a while it seemed there would be nothing at all to feel happy about again. Their only piece of good news came completely out of the blue (as good news generally does) one Sunday in early February.\n\n\nSirius was out with James - not on a mission, for once. As boys, James and Sirius had crawled into each others beds whenever one of them was unhappy. As men, they spent long afternoons rocketing around the countryside on Sirius\u2019s motorbike. Remus was not jealous - if anything it was a relief that he didn\u2019t have to go.\n\n\nHe was spending the afternoon studying counter curses, which at least made him feel like he was doing something useful. He\u2019d just decided to have a quick break and make himself a pot of tea when an owl pecked on the kitchen window. It bore a note from Lily; \u2018\n\n\nCan you pop over before five? I\u2019ll cook dinner.\n\n\n\u2019 And of course he got ready to leave at once. It was a good thing too - his own supper plans were beans on toast, which he\u2019d already had three times that week.\n\n\nIt was very cold still, the frost hung around for weeks that February, and spring took a lifetime to arrive. Remus was grateful to be able to simply step through the fireplace in their flat and instantly appear in the Potters\u2019 living room without having to go outside. He hoped Sirius was wrapped up properly; wind chill was no joke at the speeds he drove.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d Remus called, brushing soot and floo power off his shabby robes.\n\n\nHieronymus the cat mewed angrily at him - he had disturbed the warm spot on the rug.\n\n\n\u201cKitchen!\u201d Lily called back.\n\n\nRemus wandered through. The house felt empty, and had for weeks now, but the kitchen was as warm and comforting as it had ever been. Lily was sitting at the broad oak table, pouring over a recipe book, her wand holding her hair up in a messy bun. There was a self stirring pot on the stovetop, and something delicious smelling in the oven.\n\n\n\u201cHello gorgeous,\u201d she grinned, looking up at him.\n\n\n\u201cHiya,\u201d he waved, \u201cCan I help with anything?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cKnives and forks would be great,\u201d she nodded at the dresser against the wall. \u201cWe\u2019ll eat in here, I think, it\u2019s cosier.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust the two of us?\u201d He asked, going to pull out the cutlery.\n\n\n\u201cFive,\u201d she shook her head, \u201cPeter\u2019s due in a minute, and the boys shouldn\u2019t be too much longer\u2026 well, depending on Sirius.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEh?\u201d Remus frowned, the note hadn\u2019t mentioned Sirius. Lily was blushing.\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 so I asked you here because I have something to tell you\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus\u2019s hands began to shake, and he dropped the butterknife he\u2019d been holding. No news was ever good, these days, and he\u2019d developed a bit of a paranoia around announcements.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good!\u201d Lily said, quickly, seeing the look on his face, \u201cI promise! It\u2019s just that, er\u2026 we thought it might be best,\n\n\nJames\n\n\nthought it might be best, if he told Sirius on his own, you know, one on one\u2026 after what happened last time\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLast time?\u201d Remus frowned. They couldn\u2019t be getting married again, surely. \u201cYou\u2019re not splitting up?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus, I said a\n\n\ngood\n\n\nthing!\u201d Lily laughed, lightly. \u201cHonestly, you always think the worst\u2026\u201d\n\n\nShe stood up, clearing her books from the table. Remus took a good look at her. She was a bit thicker around the hips - not that he\u2019d ever say such a thing to one of his oldest and best friends. And anyway, it suited her, she was still uncommonly pretty, in his opinion. But she smelled slightly different, too.\n\n\nHe blinked, and shook his head, slamming the cutlery drawer shut so hard it rattled, and Lily jumped.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant!\u201d\n\n\nShe blushed harder, and nodded, face stretched into the broadest smile Remus had seen on anyone in months. Lost for words, he hurried around the table to hug her, \u201cAmazing!\u201d He choked, suddenly very emotional, \u201cBrilliant! Oh my god, Lily!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know!\u201d She squealed, \u201cDue in July! You\u2019ve no idea how hard it\u2019s been to stay quiet!\u201d\n\n\nRemus stepped back to give her room, and wiped his eyes.\n\n\n\u201cNot because of Sirius?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot just that\u2026\u201d she conceded, \u201cWe wanted a proper mourning period\u2026 Euphemia and Fleamont knew, of course. It was heartbreaking telling them. But I have to admit, I am\n\n\nslightly\n\n\nconcerned about how Sirius will take it\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf he says anything other than congratulations I\u2019ll box his ears!\u201d Remus said, fiercely. Lily laughed,\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to get in the queue behind me and James.\u201d\n\n\nRemus laughed, still wiping his eyes, and went to lay the table. No sooner had he set down the last plate, than a rumbling roar could be heard in the distance, getting closer. Lily looked up at him and bit her lip. He just smiled at her,\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\n\nSirius had been parking his bike on the back patio. Remus often wondered what Euphemia might make of that - but of course she could never refuse her blue eyed boy anything, and would have forgiven the muddy tire marks in her lawn with motherly indulgence.\n\n\nThe patio doors rattled open, and Sirius strode in, hair still windswept from flying, nose and cheeks pink from the cold. He was smiling, smiling so wide that Remus\u2019s heart skipped a beat, and he felt that old schoolboy crush resurface in him.\n\n\n\u201cMrs Prongs!\u201d Sirius went straight for Lily, arms wide, and enveloped her, kissing the top of her head, \u201cBloody brilliant!\u201d\n\n\nRemus sighed with relief, and went to shake hands with James, who\u2019d come in behind Sirius, hair and scarf flying, wind-burned face glowing like a beacon of joy.\n\n\n\u201cA kid!\u201d Was all Remus could think to say, \u201cYou\u2019re having a fucking kid!\u201d\n\n\nJames laughed, gripping his hand,\n\n\n\u201cToo bloody right, Moony.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSit down!\u201d Sirius pulled out a chair for Lily, ushering her into it, \u201cMerlin, Moony, what sort of gentleman are you, letting Lily do all the work in her condition?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOi,\u201d Remus scowled, \u201cI laid the table...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Lily giggled, \u201cBut if you boys want to serve dinner, be my guest. Lamb\u2019s in the oven, James, it should be done by now.\u201d\n\n\nSo the three of them bustled around the kitchen, making quite a bit more noise and mess than was probably necessary. Sirius began whistling \u2018Kooks\u2019, James cracked out a bottle of champagne to toast (with butterbeer for Lily) and Remus just grinned until his cheeks hurt, watching his friends be happy together.\n\n\nThen Peter arrived, and it began all over again, their happiness multiplying as they sat down to a perfect family dinner. It was just what everyone needed.\n\n\n\u201cHow did it even happen?!\u201d Peter exclaimed, mopping up gravy with his last yorkshire pudding.\n\n\n\u201cWell, Wormtail,\u201d Sirius smirked, \u201cWhen a witch and a wizard love eachother very much\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShuddup,\u201d Peter laughed, kicking him under the table, \u201cYou know what I meant\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt just happened,\u201d James shrugged, \u201cWe might have got a little bit careless around Halloween\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJames!\u201d Lily slapped his arm lightly with the back of her hand, \u201cNo need for detail, I\u2018m sure Moony doesn\u2019t want to hear all that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d Remus furrowed his brow,\n\n\n\u201cOh well\u2026 you know, I just know you prefer to be discreet about\u2026 um\u2026\u201d Lily fumbled for words. Remus folded his arms, staring at them all with mock-indignation.\n\n\n\u201cYou all think I\u2019m a prude!\u201d\n\n\nThey all burst out laughing, and Sirius patted him on the shoulder affectionately,\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Moony - they just don\u2019t know you like I know you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean--\u201d Peter started, but Remus - seeing where the conversation was heading - quickly intervened,\n\n\n\u201cHave you got any ideas for a name, yet?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, not really,\u201d Lily said, still chuckling, \u201cA family name would be nice, but--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhatever you do,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cCall the poor kid something\n\n\nnormal\n\n\n. No constellations, for godric\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that,\u201d Remus raised his glass sand drained it. It was his third, but he didn\u2019t think anyone had noticed, and besides, they were celebrating.\n\n\n\u201cWhen will you know what it is?\u201d Peter asked\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re\n\n\nnot\n\n\ncalling it Peter,\u201d James teased him.\n\n\n\u201cBagsy godfather!\u201d Sirius shouted.\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t\n\n\nbagsy\n\n\ngodfather!\u201d Peter said, outraged,\n\n\n\u201cJust did,\u201d Sirius poked his tongue out.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nAnd so, as per usual, it was James and Lily who managed to bring everyone out of that gloomy winter slog, just in time for spring. The marauders and their friends faced the rest of their year with fresh eyes and renewed purpose. Because fighting a war was one thing - but fighting for the Potters\u2019 future child made every challenge seem more worthwhile.\n\n\nWhat was more, they weren\u2019t the only ones celebrating good news. Arthur and Molly welcomed yet another red haired son that March, and Alice announced that she and Frank were also expecting in the summer.\n\n\n\u201cImagine that!\u201d Mary said, clearing away tea cups and mugs of coffee left behind from an Order meeting, \u201cTheir kids are all going to grow up together, and go to Hogwarts together\u2026 it\u2019s sort of nice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded in agreement. He would have given anything to be raised by any one of these people; to have a childhood surrounded by magic and love and laughter.\n\n\nHe had never given much thought to children before - his own childhood had been such a disaster he didn\u2019t think he was fit to be a parent. But watching James and Lily do it; that actually sounded pretty nice.\n\n\nOf course, Remus\u2019s enthusiasm for \u2018Baby Prongs\u2019 paled in comparison to Sirius\u2019s overwhelming excitement.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be so much fun, Moony!\u201d he babbled, coming in one May afternoon from another spur of the moment shopping trip, \u201cImagine them all on brooms! The Order of the Phoenix Quidditch team!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 how old do you need to be to ride a broom?\u201d Remus asked, eyeing his packages nervously. None of them looked broom-shaped, but you never knew with Sirius.\n\n\n\u201cThese are mostly books and clothes,\u201d Sirius reassured him, laughing lightly, \u201cAnd some toys, just little things\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis kid is going to be so spoilt\u2026\u201d Remus tutted.\n\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Sirius poked his tongue out. \u201cDoesn\u2019t do anyone any good to be brought up joyless, does it, Moony?\u201d He raised an eyebrow and Remus ducked his head, ashamed, and he never chastised Sirius about it again.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nIn June, after the full moon, Remus was invited for another meeting with Moody and Ferox. A year older and wiser, he requested not to meet them at the Auror\u2019s office this time. They agreed - they didn\u2019t have much choice. Remus had grown very flippant about his role as unofficial werewolf liaison officer, and it probably showed. At least Moody didn\u2019t boss him around much any more.\n\n\nThey met in a small working man\u2019s pub just outside of Derby. Remus arrived first and got himself a pint, then sat down with a newspaper he\u2019d picked up at the train station. He took out the page with the crossword on it and folded it up neatly into his breast pocket. Sirius liked doing crosswords.\n\n\nHe chose a seat in the back on the pub, because it was quiet, but also because the seat was a high backed wooden pew, which was good for his back. He was hurting after the last moon, still, and tried to sit straight.\n\n\nFerox got there a few minutes later.\n\n\n\u201cAlright there, our Kev?\u201d He nodded, sitting down on the three legged stool opposite Remus.\n\n\nThey had all received instructions to start using fake names when out on Order business, in case anyone listened in. Remus wasn\u2019t overly fond of \u2018Kevin\u2019, but he had to admit it was probably better than his own ridiculous name. When the marauders first heard about the codenames they\u2019d wanted to use Paul, John, George and Ringo, but Moody told them it was too obvious.\n\n\n\u201cHello, Norman.\u201d Remus nodded at Ferox.\n\n\n\u201cMr Thompson won\u2019t be long.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood. Get you a drink?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNah, on duty.\u201d\n\n\nRemus shrugged and took a glug of his own beer. Ferox watched him with a level expression. \u201cSo,\u201d his old teacher asked, \u201cHow\u2019s tricks?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, you know,\u201d Remus shrugged again, \u201cWe\u2019re all just doing what we can.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHear you\u2019ve been busy - got a knack for security, eh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been helping out Alice--er\u2026 Steffi. Sorry.\u201d\n\n\nFerox laughed gruffly at Remus\u2019s blunder,\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s all bollocks anyway. Still, security\u2019s a good talent to have , eh? Something you might fancy doing for the ministry, maybe? After all this is over?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSecurity alarms?\u201d Remus frowned. He hadn\u2019t really thought about it before. \u201cI dunno, it\u2019s not really\u2026 I mean, I want to help people, obviously, but I\u2019m not sure if\u2026 people don\u2019t want someone like me in their homes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cChin up, lad,\u201d Ferox said, kindly, \u201cIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom.\u201d\n\n\nRemus drank again. He was nearly finished, and wondered if he would have time for a second pint. Probably not. Not very professional. Though, it was\n\n\ntechnically\n\n\nmedicinal - his back really hurt.\n\n\nMoody - \u2018Mr Thompson\u2019 - arrived a few moments later. He was looking more haggard than ever. The war seemed to affect him physically - he had accumulated more scars than anyone Remus knew (except himself, maybe). In return, he had lost more body parts - if Moody wasn\u2019t more careful, Remus thought, he\u2019d end up like old professor Kettleburn.\n\n\n\u201cKevin, Norman,\u201d Moody nodded at them both.\n\n\nHe was wearing muggle clothes - or at least his approximation of them. A gaudy hawaiian shirt paired with ancient looking mustard yellow bell-bottoms. Remus had to concentrate to keep a straight face.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get straight to business,\u201d he said, taking the third stool around the table. \u201cHe\u2019s been seen again. Our mutual acquaintance.\u201d\n\n\nThat meant Greyback. Remus swallowed, nodding,\n\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOutside of Dublin. We reckon he\u2019s been keeping a low profile; licking his wounds, but he\u2019s still in you-know-who\u2019s pay.\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded again. He\u2019d known Greyback wouldn\u2019t be vanquished so easily; he\u2019d always known they would meet again, eventually.\n\n\n\u201cThe good news is,\u201d Ferox said, learning in, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been recruiting - all sources seem to say that most of his pack have left him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSources?\u201d Remus looked at him, sharply.\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Ferox grinned, \u201cI took a little trip to the emerald isle last week.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou what?!\u201d Remus was shaken by this news. \u201cYou could have been killed!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCalm down, lad,\u201d Moody said, laying his palm on the table. \u201cNorman here\u2019s been on this case since you were a nipper. He knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh, he\u2019s just worried, eh Kev?\u201d Ferox nudged him.\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t respond. How could he tell these two men - who were older, more experienced, wiser, and probably more powerful than him - that they were being idiots? It was completely ridiculous that even fifteen years after Lyall Lupin\u2019s death the ministry continued to underestimate Greyback. Refused to learn anything from their mistakes.\n\n\n\u201cYou should have told me.\u201d He said, finally. \u201cI could have helped. Advised you, at least.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go alone, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Ferox smiled, \u201cI took young Daniel with me - I mean, er\u2026 no, bugger, I\u2019ve forgotten it\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDanny?!\u201d Remus balked, even more alarmed, \u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was nothing personal,\u201d Moody said, \u201cYou know more about them than anyone, but after last year, you\u2019re just too close, too recogniseable to the pack. We couldn\u2019t risk it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI wish you\u2019d told me.\u201d Remus repeated, though he knew it was getting him nowhere.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re telling you now.\u201d\n\n\nRemus pursed his lips. Danny McKinnon! Greyback must be laughing at them; they just had no idea.\n\n\n\u201cSo, what, then?\u201d He asked, knowing he was visibly irritated now. \u201cWhat do you need from me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, we know he\u2019s on the move. He left Dublin after the last full moon, without a trace. Him and a young female.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLivia,\u201d Remus said.\n\n\n\u201cYou know who she is?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s most likely her,\u201d Remus nodded, \u201cShe\u2019s his most loyal supporter, she\u2019ll never leave him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCould you give us a description? Daniel caught a scent, but we didn\u2019t get eyes on her.\u201d Ferox said, eagerly.\n\n\nRemus nodded.\n\n\n\u201cOk. But you need to tell me, next time--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine, fine,\u201d Moody shook his head impatiently, \u201cWe\u2019ll keep you in the loop,\n\n\nwhere possible and within reason\n\n\n. Now, what can you tell us about this Livia bitch?\u201d\n\n\nRemus told them as much as he knew. He felt he was re-treading old territory, but no one ever listened to him anyway. He explained what Livia looked like - that was easy enough, she was hardly an ordinary looking witch.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get them lad, don\u2019t you worry,\u201d Ferox said as he shook Remus\u2019s hand before leaving. He had completely missed the point.\n\n\nThey hadn\u2019t tracked down Castor\u2019s pack - if they were still a pack. Moody thought they\u2019d left the country, and Remus hoped so. He hoped no one ever found them again. By the time they were all ready to go, Remus needed a shot, never mind another pint - his back was twinging with every step, threatening a full on spasm. And he was in a seriously bad mood.\n\n\nHe apparated back to London, and pushed his front door open so hard the knob banged against the plasterboard.\n\n\n\u201cFucking hell!\u201d Sirius jumped out of his seat on the couch.\n\n\nRemus blinked at him, embarrassed.\n\n\n\u201cSorry. Didn\u2019t know you were in.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBloody Moody! Bloody\n\n\nFerox\n\n\n!\u201d Remus winced as he pulled off his jacket.\n\n\n\u201cDoes your back still hurt?\u201d Sirius cocked his head, sympathetically. \u201cCome here.\u201d He shuffled back on the couch, pulling his knees up so that Remus could sit in front of him.\n\n\nRemus did, and closed his eyes, sighing gratefully as Sirius began to rub his shoulders firmly, wringing the pain out with his clever fingers.\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d He asked, \u201cThey\u2019re not\u2026 you don\u2019t have to go again, do you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Remus said, \u201cNo, just\u2026 I dunno, do you ever feel like everyone thinks you\u2019re just some idiotic kid who doesn\u2019t know anything?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo one thinks that.\u201d Sirius soothed.\n\n\n\u201cI know\n\n\nyou lot\n\n\ndon\u2019t, but\u2026 ugh. They just don\u2019t listen to me. I know more about the werewolves than anyone in the Order. I\u2019m Greyback\u2019s prodigal son, for god\u2019s sake!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d Sirius suddenly wrapped his arms around Remus\u2019s waist, pulling him close and tight, as if he was about to bolt. \u201cIf Moody and Ferox keep you away from that monster then good.\u201d\n\n\nRemus leaned into Sirius, and didn\u2019t say any more.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nWill you stay in our lovers\u2019 story?\n\n\n\n\nIf you stay, you won\u2019t be sorry,\n\n\n\n\n\u2018cuz we believe in you.\n\n\n\n\nSoon you\u2019ll grow, so take a chance\n\n\n\n\nOn a couple of kooks, hung up on romancing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31st July 1980\n\n\n\u201cRemus, wake up!\u201d Sirius shook him hard.\n\n\n\u201cPiss off.\u201d Remus grunted, covering his head with the duvet, \u201cS\u2019the middle of the night.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho cares?! Come on, it\u2019s time! Baby Prongs is on his way - or her way\u2026 their way!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Remus sat bolt upright in bed, \u201cFuck!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d Sirius cheered, \u201cGet dressed!\u201d\n\n\nRemus scrambled out of bed, and got dressed so fast he tripped over his trouser legs twice, banging his head on the dresser.\n\n\n\u201cOw.\u201d He grumbled, rubbing his forehead as he joined Sirius in the living room.\n\n\n\u201cSilly sod,\u201d Sirius said fondly, \u201cLucky Marlene\u2019ll be there, eh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI have a feeling she\u2019ll be busy\u2026\u201d\n\n\nSirius walked into the fireplace, grabbing some floo powder. Just as he was about to throw it down, he gave Remus a funny look, cocking his head, \u201cMoony, your shirt\u2019s on inside out.\n\n\nPotter Manor.\n\n\n\u201d\n\n\nAnd with a blaze of green flame, he was gone. Remus looked down at his shirt. The buttons were on the inside. Damn. Ah well, he was too sleepy, and too jittery to sort it out now. He took a handful of floo powder and walked into the fireplace next.\n\n\nHe stepped out into the Potters\u2019 living room, which currently resembled a train station waiting room. Gully came scuttling through, arms piled high with blankets, and Mary, Peter, Sirius and Arthur Weasley were standing about, talking.\n\n\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Mary gave him a quick hug. \u201cYour shirt\u2019s inside out,\u201d she said, smoothing a hand over his chest.\n\n\n\u201cAny news?\u201d He asked.\n\n\n\u201cJames sent a patronus for Marlene about two hours ago - she was staying at mine to be closer to St Mungo\u2019s, so I came too. They\u2019ve been upstairs ever since, I asked if there was anything I could do, but you know what Marls is like when she\u2019s got a job to do\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJames is up there too?\u201d Remus glanced at the ceiling nervously. He\u2019d never say so, but he had an absolute horror of childbirth. He wasn\u2019t one hundred percent sure what it involved, other than a lot of screaming and probably blood too.\n\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think they need anything?\u201d Sirius said, wandering towards the stairs.\n\n\n\u201cMs McKinnon will have it all under control,\u201d Arthur said, cheerfully, \u201cJames won\u2019t be doing anything more useful than holding Lily\u2019s hand, I promise you. Sit down lads, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re all in for a very long wait.\u201d\n\n\nThey all did, quietly. There was a funny atmosphere - no one except Arthur had ever experienced this sort of worry before, and Remus was very glad he was there. Mary got up and drew the curtains back. It was the peak of summer, and the sun was already full in the sky, birds singing and the muggle milkman whistling as he made his rounds.\n\n\n\u201cTea, anyone?\u201d Remus said, feeling the need to do something useful. He eyed Peter, who was leaning on his elbow, head nodding, \u201cOr coffee maybe?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood man, Moony,\u201d Sirius nodded, \u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d\n\n\nIn the kitchen, they found that Gully had already laid out the things for tea, and set some water to boil in the big copper kettle on the hob, so Remus and Sirius only needed to bother with the coffee. They did this quietly, though Remus caught Sirius\u2019s eye once or twice and couldn't help but smile at the boyish excitement he saw there.\n\n\nJust as they were about to bring the trays through to the living room, a door upstairs slammed open, and footsteps could be heard on the landing.\n\n\n\u201cPadfoot?!\u201d James\u2019s voice.\n\n\n\u201cProngs?!\u201d Siris ran through to the hallway, leaning over the stair bannister and staring upwards. Remus hurried to join him, and Peter was not far behind.\n\n\nJames peered down at them, red faced, misty eyes and beaming.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a boy!\u201d\n\n\nHarry. That was the name they\u2019d decided on, according to Marlene, who came down to gratefully accept a cup of tea and sank slowly into the couch. She had dark rings under her eyes, but smiled at everybody anyway.\n\n\n\u201cLightning fast delivery,\u201d she murmured, sipping the milky brew slowly, \u201cTwenty minutes active labour!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll be a chaser, like James!\u201d Peter said, eagerly.\n\n\n\u201cIs Lily ok?\u201d Mary asked.\n\n\nMarlene nodded, \u201cOf course she is. Nothing stops Evans.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be off, then,\u201d Arthur said, standing up and fastening his threadbare cloak, \u201cI\u2019ve been away from Molly and the boys too long already - I\u2019ll let Dumbledore know the good news, of course.\u201d\n\n\nThey all said goodbye. Once he\u2019d gone, Sirius went to the stairs again to look up.\n\n\n\u201cSirius, love,\u201d Marlene called sharply, \u201cGive them a bit of time alone, eh? Family time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, ok.\u201d He nodded, turning back to the room and leaning in the door frame. He stared into space for a while, and for once Remus couldn\u2019t guess what he was thinking. Sirius shook his head slowly, and said, \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d very low.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice name, I think.\u201d Mary said, brightly. She glanced at Marlene and stifled a giggle, \u201cBetter than Neville, eh?\u201d\n\n\nMarlene giggled too, guiltily, \u201cOh, don\u2019t, I could barely keep a straight face when Frank told me.\u201d\n\n\nRemus got up and went to stand with Sirius. He threaded their fingers together.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a godfather,\u201d he whispered. Sirius turned his head towards Remus, smiling,\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he nodded, \u201c... blimey, I really hope I don\u2019t balls it up.\u201d"

No he ain't.\n\n\n\n\nHe's just another burden on the welfare state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday 3rd September 1980\n\n\n\nWhooosh - splash.\n\n\n\nRemus landed on his feet - just about - right in a muddy puddle in the middle of the high street.\n\n\n\u201cBugger.\u201d He muttered, yanking his cloak up out of the way - his boots were beyond saving, socks already soaked through. He hadn\u2019t realised the holes were that bad, it was definitely time for a new pair, he\u2019d need to check his savings.\n\n\nIt looked like it might rain later, too. Bloody\n\n\nperfect\n\n\n.\n\n\nRemus was in a very bad mood, and wet feet were the least of it. Still, he was in Hogsmeade for a reason, and he knew he just had to pull his (metaphorical) socks up and get on with it. He wished he wasn\u2019t alone, but even if someone had been available to come with him (James had the baby, Lily and Sirius were in Broadstairs on reconnaissance, Marlene, Peter and Mary were all working), he\u2019d been told to come alone. As usual.\n\n\nHe trudged towards the Three Broomsticks, thinking at least there would be a nice warm fire and maybe a nip of whisky waiting for him. He\u2019d need it. Whenever he was summoned to meet someone alone, it was usually werewolf business, and that always required a stiff drink. He hoped it was news of Greyback rather than Castor.\n\n\nIt began to spit rain as he came within sight of the pub, and he jogged a bit to save the rest of his clothes from damp. It was a quiet afternoon in the little scottish village - the students of Hogwarts would be in their lessons, the wizards who lived in town would be at their occupations. And very few people left the house these days, if they didn\u2019t have to.\n\n\nThe pub was nice and empty. Remus felt a stab of nostalgia as he entered, remembering how only two short years ago he and his friends had all sat in one of the booths, bright-eyed and naive, looking forward to their futures. Who could have known that saving the world would be such a grey, monotonous slog?\n\n\n\u201cRemus Lupin, as I live and breathe!\u201d Rosmerta chirped from the bar, one hand on her round hip, bosom overflowing as usual. She glanced hopefully over his shoulder, \u201cBlack not joining you?\u201d\n\n\nRemus shook his head, and went to take a seat near the hearth, so he could at least try to dry out his shoes.\n\n\n\u201cNot today, Rosmerta,\u201d he said, trying to affect good cheer, \u201cCould I get a glass of--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTwo glasses -- of butterbeer, please,\u201d a familiar voice intoned. Remus whipped around, finding himself face to face with Dumbledore.\n\n\n\u201cOh, h-hello, professor.\u201d Remus said, embarrassed.\n\n\n\u201cRemus,\u201d Dumbledore nodded politely. He never called him \u2018Mr Lupin\u2019, not since Remus had asked him not to, years ago. \u201cPlease, be seated,\u201d he gestured grandly, like a vicar about to give a sermon.\n\n\nRemus sat. Dumbledore always made him feel eleven years old.\n\n\n\u201cHow have you been?\u201d His old headmaster asked, kindly, gracefully taking the armchair opposite. He set down a heavy looking leather briefcase on the rug between them. Remus eyed it warily, but answered,\n\n\n\u201cWell, thanks. You know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThese are difficult times.\u201d Dumbledore said, and Remus didn\u2019t respond to that, because he wasn\u2019t sure he was supposed to.\n\n\nRosmerta bustled over with the butterbeers, setting them down on the little round side table. When she\u2019d left, Remus lifted his tankard and drank, just for a distraction. He could pretend it was alcohol, maybe that would help steady him. He desperately wanted a cigarette, but for some reason that felt wrong in front of Dumbledore. So he just sipped the butterbeer, feeling the cloying syrupy mixture rest on his tongue, slide down his throat.\n\n\n\u201cYou must be wondering why I asked you here,\u201d Dumbledore said, watching him.\n\n\n\u201cIs it\u2026 is it\u2026 Greyback?\u201d Remus whispered. Dumbledore smiled,\n\n\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about eavesdroppers, Remus, we are quite safe to speak freely here. No, alas, there have been no further reports of Greyback or the young lady he is travelling with.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Remus blinked. Well then what?\n\n\n\u201cThis is rather a more pressing matter - or at least, it will be, if I am correct.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d Remus shifted uncomfortably. He was not usually the go-to agent when it came to \u2018pressing matters\u2019. Dumbledore seemed to read his mind.\n\n\n\u201cI am in need of someone with a keen eye for detail, and a good deal of patience.\u201d He leaned forward and opened the briefcase a crack. Remus peered inside.\n\n\n\u201cBooks!\u201d He said, surprised. There must be a hundred of them inside - some sort of extension charm perhaps.\n\n\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Dumbledore smiled, closing the briefcase again.\n\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 you need some research done?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI do indeed. Tell me, Remus, how much do you know about prophecy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 well I never took Divination,\u201d he scratched his head. He was intrigued now, \u201cBut obviously it comes up a bit in Runes\u2026 I\u2019ve read a bit.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou will need to read a lot more,\u201d Dumbledore said, gravely, \u201cAnd I must impress upon you both the importance of this task, and the sensitivity. Anything you learn must be kept entirely confidential, do you understand?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026 of course,\u201d Remus nodded, slightly alarmed. \u201cBut what do you want me to look for?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFor now, we are simply seeking a fuller understanding of the nature of prophecy. Many of these books contain secret transcripts - some of which may need translating - of known prophetic and oracular statements. I should like to know if there are any which appear to relate to Voldemort, or to this particular moment in history.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 you think someone might have already made a prophecy? About how the war ends?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey may have.\u201d The professor replied, shortly. \u201cBut we cannot afford to make any rash decisions. While there is still time, I would like to know as much as we can.\u201d\n\n\nDumbledore switched between \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018we\u2019 regularly, when he spoke about the war, Remus noticed. Still, he thought he pretty much understood,\n\n\n\u201cOk.\u201d He said, \u201cHow shall I let you know, if I find anything?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI shall come to you.\u201d Dumbledore replied, cryptically. \u201cOnce again, Remus, I cannot overstate the importance of this task. You must tell nobody, understood?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\n\n\nThat meant not telling Sirius, or James, or any one of his friends. Sometimes Remus wondered if secrets were simply his lot in life. He thought for a moment, \u201cProfessor?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShould I keep an eye out for prophecies that have been prevented - or--\u201d he re-phrased, because he knew that was impossible, \u201cCircumvented? I mean, I don\u2019t know loads about it, but there are always loopholes, aren\u2019t there?\u201d\n\n\nDumbledore\u2019s eyes glittered, and a small smile played on his lips.\n\n\n\u201cVery good, Remus.\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday 24th October 1980\n\n\nAnd that was how Remus spent much of his autumn. He studied well into October. It wasn\u2019t bad at all - actually, he enjoyed it. He\u2019d always liked research, and though he missed the peaceful airy chambers of Hogwarts\u2019 library, he was pretty content squirrelled away in the little London flat, with endless pots of tea and a quietly smoking ashtray on hand.\n\n\nIf Sirius came in, he would cast\n\n\nobfuscate\n\n\nover his books and notes, and Sirius seemed happy with this arrangement. He understood what needed to be done in the service of the war.\n\n\nAnyway, they were barely at the flat - Remus only used it to work in. They spent much more of their time at the Potters\u2019 mansion, where James\u2019s old bedroom had been turned into a nursery, but Sirius\u2019s old bedroom was the same as ever, only with half of Remus\u2019s things in it too. Together, the marauders and Lily had grown into a funny little family, with baby Harry at the centre.\n\n\nIt took Remus a month or so to really get over his fear of infants - and it still made him a bit anxious to actually hold Harry - but Sirius had been a huge help.\n\n\nSirius was utterly besotted with his godson. The child was barely ever out of his arms when they were visiting (a relief for Lily and James, who were only just bearing up under the pressure of parenthood combined with their duties for the Order).\n\n\n\u201cSay Padfoot, Harry, go on! Pah-d-foo-t\u2026\u201d Sirius cooed one evening, as he bounced the tiny little green-eyed creature on his lap.\n\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t talk until they\u2019re at least one,\u201d Remus smirked, sitting gingerly on the arm of the couch, \u201cI looked it up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nNormal\n\n\nkids don\u2019t,\u201d Sirius tossed his hair back, gently holding Harry\u2019s chubby little wrists, \u201cBut Harry Potter is no ordinary baby, he\u2019s clearly very advanced for his age. Come on, Harry, say\n\n\nPad-foot\n\n\n\u2026\u201d\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up,\u201d Lily laughed, \u201cJames\u2019s mum told me\n\n\nhe\n\n\ndidn\u2019t speak until eighteen months.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOi,\u201d James yelled from his father\u2019s study, \u201cI was an extremely thoughtful child, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah, what changed?\u201d Sirius yelled back, grinning.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re hogging him, Padfoot!\u201d Peter whined, reaching his arms out, \u201cCome on, I haven\u2019t had a cuddle yet,\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot my fault he likes me best,\u201d Sirius replied, poking his tongue out at Peter, and then at Harry, puffing out his cheeks and bulging his eyes so that the baby giggled and burbled contentedly.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you a cuddle, Pete,\u201d Remus teased.\n\n\n\u201cLily, tell him!\u201d Peter tutted, folding his arms crossly.\n\n\n\u201cHonestly! I\u2019ve got one son and that\u2019s plenty,\u201d Lily laughed, getting up, \u201cNo fighting while mummy and daddy are out, ok boys?\u201d She gave them all a very stern look.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been spending too much time with Molly.\u201d Sirius said.\n\n\n\u201cRight, I\u2019m ready,\u201d James came back through to the living room in his travelling cloak. Lily already had hers on. She gave him a stoic smile,\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d\n\n\nA cold silence entered the room, and Remus looked at the floor, because he couldn\u2019t bring himself to look at any of his friends, and especially not the baby.\n\n\nLily broke it,\n\n\n\u201cOh, stop being so melodramatic, you lot. It\u2019s a standard mission, we\u2019ve done a hundred of these.\u201d She went over to Sirius and bent to kiss Harry\u2019s head - already sprouting a thatch of fine black hair. \u201cBye bye Harry, mummy and daddy love you so much. We\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d\n\n\nJames didn\u2019t say goodbye - he had a wooden, muted expression that Remus had been seeing more and more of since his parents\u2019 funeral.\n\n\n\u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t tell us where--\u201d Pete started.\n\n\n\u201cSorry Wormy,\u201d James held his hands up, \u201cMoody\u2019s orders. You know how it is.\u201d\n\n\nPeter nodded, shoulders slumping. Remus knew how he felt - it was difficult enough knowing that your friends were walking into danger. It was even harder not knowing exactly what they would be facing - as though they were disappearing out of reach.\n\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Lily hurried her husband, pulling him from the room, \u201cBack before morning, we hope!\u201d She called from the hallway. And then the door slammed, and Harry burst into tears.\n\n\n\u201cOh bugger,\u201d Sirius said, over the screams, \u201cEr\u2026 have him now if you like, Pete?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt took hours to finally calm Harry down. He bawled as if his heart was broken, and wouldn\u2019t settle until it was nearly midnight.\n\n\n\u201cDefinitely couldn\u2019t do this full time,\u201d Sirius said, head in his hands as he slumped on the floor of the nursery.\n\n\n\u201cJesus, I swear the kid\u2019s possessed.\u201d Remus whispered, rubbing his temples. He had a splitting headache.\n\n\n\u201cShit, you should go to bed,\u201d Sirius said, looking up at him. His usually immaculate silky black hair was in knots, and there was definitely still some milky baby sick stuck in there. Without a trace of irony, he frowned at Remus, \u201cYou must be exhausted,\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Remus shrugged - he tried not to wince as he felt every tendon in his back tug. Yesterday had been a full moon. \u201cActually I wasn\u2019t going to stay\u2026 you know, I\u2019ve got that work to do.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, that.\u201d Sirius nodded. His mouth was a straight line. He climbed to his feet, glancing at the red and gold cot one last time. Harry was sleeping, thank god. They both padded quietly out of the room, leaving it open just a crack.\n\n\nOn the landing, where the lights were still on, Sirius looked even worse - he had rings under his eyes, which were bloodshot. Remus touch his arm gently,\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nYou\n\n\nought to go to bed.\u201d\n\n\nSirius grabbed his arm, suddenly, eyes widening,\n\n\n\u201cMoony, don\u2019t go.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEh? I\u2019m only going to the flat\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPlease?\u201d Sirius clutched at him, half mad with tiredness, \u201cJust take the night off, just stay here with me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPete\u2019s here\u2026\u201d Remus turned his head slightly. He could hear Peter snoring in the couch downstairs. Not much comfort, he supposed,\n\n\n\u201cBut I want you,\u201d Sirius said, desperately.\n\n\nThat struck Remus in an unusual way. To anyone else, it might have sounded whinging; childish. After all, Sirius was a grown man, and Remus had important work to do. But somehow it dislodged a feeling Remus hadn\u2019t had for Sirius in a long time - a desire to protect him. To hold him close and tell him everything was going to be ok, and to be strong and reliable for the man he loved.\n\n\nAmazed by this revelation, Remus did exactly that, hugging Sirius tightly and kissing his filthy hair,\n\n\n\u201cOk then,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d\n\n\nAfter all, he thought, as Sirius trailed off to have a shower, relief evident in his posture; wouldn\u2019t Sirius do the same for him?\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nFriday 21st November 1980\n\n\nThat time, Lily and James came back, as always; tired, a little harder, a little less bright, but otherwise perfectly ok. Remus always felt enormous relief when any of his friends returned safely, and each time swore to himself he would not take it for granted. But what does that mean, when you are young?\n\n\nThere had been deaths - deaths in the Order, deaths of people he knew - but no one really close. No one he truly loved. The Prewetts he had been fond of. Benjy Fenwick he had chatted to once or twice. But they weren\u2019t close, and their losses didn\u2019t affect him severely. Compared to others, Remus had been extremely lucky.\n\n\nOf course, you never feel lucky, at the time. Good fortune is too often something that can only be recognised with hindsight.\n\n\nSirius turned twenty one in November. They didn\u2019t have a party, but Hagrid baked a rather wonky - though very large and very delicious - cake, which they all ate at the Order safe house after the regular meeting. Someone took a few photos, but Remus forgot to try and track them down.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal for muggles, twenty-one.\u201d He commented as they climbed into bed that evening. \u201cThat\u2019s when they come of age.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy? Muggles can\u2019t do magic.\u201d Sirius frowned, yawning.\n\n\n\u201cNo, I know, it\u2019s just an old fashioned thing,\u201d Remus tried to explain. \u201cYou get the key to your front door or something like that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDaft muggles.\u201d Sirius grumbled, his eyes already closing. \u201cI feel old.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re not,\u201d Remus settled down beside him, \u201cI\u2019m the one going grey. Twenty-one is young. Really really young.\u201d\n\n\nSirius sighed wearily.\n\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t feel it.\u201d\n\n\nRemus knew exactly what he meant, but he didn\u2019t like it. They were all of them caught in a confusing place between adolescence and adulthood - baby Harry had only exacerbated that. There was a sense of time running out; of needing to accomplish as much as possible as fast as possible. Peter\u2019s crawling at his ministry job, always angling for a better position; James and Lily playing house and soldiers at the same time - Remus and his stupid drinking.\n\n\nAt least he had the research to do. That seemed to be going well - every now and then Dumbledore dropped by to see how he was getting on. And Remus would offload as much information as he could - with detail, because he knew Dumbledore liked detail. The old man would nod sagely, stroke his beard and sit quietly, ruminating. If he came to any conclusions, he didn\u2019t tell Remus.\n\n\nIt felt good, though. Remus even felt himself warming to Dumbledore for the first time. He liked being useful. And then, just before the November full moon, Remus got his chance to be\n\n\nreally\n\n\nuseful.\n\n\nAs usual, there was a message from Moody. He was to apparate to some very specific coordinates on Friday 21st November, and meet Ferox there.\n\n\n\u201cTell him no,\u201d Sirius said, annoyed, \u201cBloody Moody, he knows that\u2019s the night before the full moon! You shouldn\u2019t be out running his errands when you\u2019re not well.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJesus, you make me sound like an invalid,\u201d Remus rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a good reason for it. I\u2019ll be fine, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSend a patronus, if anything happens?\u201d Sirius asked, solemnly. \u201cI don\u2019t care about protocol, just say you\u2019ll let me know?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt will be\n\n\nfine\n\n\n.\u201d Remus repeated.\n\n\nHe really did feel fine about it all. When the moon was waxing he often felt stronger than usual, and usually didn\u2019t get bouts of nausea until a few hours before sunset.\n\n\nIt was good to get out of London; away from traffic and noise and crowds. It was good to get away from the Potters\u2019 - from nappies and baby talk and crying and creamed spinach. At the agreed time, Remus apparated following the instructions he\u2019d been given, and found himself on a windy clifftop, somewhere very cold and bleak.\n\n\nThe sea crashed and raged miles below, and the long grass whipped around his ankles. Remus breathed in, deeply, inhaling the salt, the soil, the sharp cold scent of the clouds. The wolf inside licked its lips, ears pricking to attention. Yes. Greyback had been here.\n\n\n\u201cHello!\u201d Ferox was a way off in the distance, a stick figure man waving at him. Remus raised a palm in greeting, bent forward into the wind and trudged to meet him.\n\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d he said, breathless as he approached, cold hands deep in his pockets, nose frozen. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGalloway,\u201d Ferox said, cheerfully. He had a thick leather cloak on, with a hood, but his face was still ruddy from the harsh weather, and white fog blew from his lips as he spoke. \u201cPretty, eh?\u201d\n\n\nRemus wasn\u2019t sure if he was being sarcastic or not, so he just gave a neutral smile. Privately he thought that yes, the landscape was beautiful, if forbidding.\n\n\n\u201cGreyback\u2019s been here.\u201d He said, wanting to get down to it.\n\n\n\u201cYou know for sure?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOne hundred percent.\u201d Remus nodded. \u00a0Ferox nodded too,\n\n\n\u201cExcellent, we were right, then. There was a report to the muggle police about a couple of tramps, man and a woman, looking shifty. Reckon they\u2019ve been here, then?\u201d\n\n\nRemus considered, breathing in again,\n\n\n\u201cYeah, but the scent\u2019s old\u2026 maybe a day or so.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight. Shall we take a walk, then? See if it gets a bit stronger?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk\u2026\u201d Remus wasn\u2019t sure how he felt, being the Order\u2019s bloodhound. But he wanted to find Greyback as much as anyone, so he did as he was told.\n\n\nThey strolled up and down the clifftop for a while, until Remus could be sure which way the trail led. As they headed downhill, away from the sea and down towards a small country road, he grew confident that Livia and Greyback had been there very recently, and began to walk faster. Ferox had no trouble keeping up, of course; he was as fit and healthy as he\u2019d ever been.\n\n\n\u201cWhat will we do, if we find him?\u201d Remus asked as they walked. He was careful not to bring Livia into it, because - ok, while she was definitely a killer, he couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit more sympathetic towards her. After all, she was his sister, in a warped kind of way.\n\n\n\u201cMoody reckons they\u2019re hunkered down somewhere for the full moon,\u201d Ferox replied, \u201cBased on my research, werewolves are weakest right after the moon, so we\u2019ll wait until then.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYour research?\u201d Remus gave him a funny look.\n\n\n\u201cFew books I\u2019ve picked up - there\u2019s not a lot to go on, beyond the NEWT level stuff.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHave you spoken to Madam Pomfrey? She looked after me for seven years, she knows loads,\u201d Remus said, trying not to sound too impatient. \u201cOr Marlene McKinnon? She\u2019s been constructing her own case studies, to see if any advances can be made in lycanthropy treatment. Or, y\u2019know. You could ask\n\n\nme\n\n\n. I might know a bit.\u201d\n\n\nFerox laughed good naturedly,\n\n\n\u201cAll right lad, all right, I see what you\u2019re saying. It\u2019s just that there isn\u2019t always time to follow umpteen leads on a prick like Greyback. Got to move fast.\u201d\n\n\nRemus said nothing, because it would only have come out wrong. He really hated criticising Ferox, it felt so awkward and embarrassing. He\u2019d looked up to him as an ideal vision of manhood, once, and he didn\u2019t like tampering with that illusion too much. But\n\n\nhonestly\n\n\n.The way he talked, you\u2019d think Greyback was just some petty criminal, not a murderous creature and charismatic cult leader.\n\n\nThe scent had grown very strong, now, and as they crested the next hill, Remus could make out a large grey-black structure in the distance. The ruins of an old castle - Scotland was littered with them of course. This one was a tower house, and looked like a big square prison squatting ominously over the remains of a boggy moat.\n\n\n\u201cThere.\u201d Remus said, stopping short. \u201cThat\u2019s where he\u2019ll be.\u201d\n\n\nFerox clapped him on the shoulder.\n\n\n\u201cGood work, lad.\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nSaturday 22nd November\n\n\nFerox didn\u2019t want Remus present for the confrontation with Greyback. Remus did not give a toss. He knew where to go, and when, and nothing would change his mind.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming too, then.\u201d Sirius said, firmly, after he\u2019d wheedled enough information out of Remus.\n\n\n\u201cNo you\u2019re bloody not.\u201d Remus said.\n\n\n\u201cAm too. Sorry Moony, but there is absolutely no way I\u2019m losing you to that monster a second time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t lose me last time, you big drama queen, it was a mission,\u201d Remus countered, \u201cAnyway, I can\u2019t put you in that sort of danger.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in danger every day,\u201d Sirius shrugged, \u201cIf it\u2019s right after the full moon, you\u2019ll need my help apparating.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done that before,\u201d Remus dismissed, \u201cIt\u2019s hard, but I\u2019ll manage. Anyway, this isn\u2019t a normal mission, you wouldn\u2019t just be backup, you\u2019d be leverage against me. He knows who you are. He knows what you mean to me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe made you tell him?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSort of. I told you they can read minds.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat bastard. I\u2019m definitely coming with you.\u201d\n\n\nRemus had forgotten how strongly Sirius felt about legilimency. Walpurga had used it as a punishment, and he would forever associate mindreading with black magic. Remus hadn\u2019t raised the fact that this appeared to be a werewolf trait, and that, when pushed, he could do it too. Probably not a good idea to mention that just yet, he decided.\n\n\nSo Sirius got his way, of course, and Remus just hoped he would be able to protect him.\n\n\nThey went to the Lake District for the full moon; a place the marauders had enjoyed themselves before, a place with happy memories. James and Peter didn\u2019t go. James hadn\u2019t joined them for a full moon since Harry was born, and Remus understood that he didn\u2019t want to be away from his family too often. Peter said something vague about working late, and honestly Remus was too busy worrying about the upcoming battle with Greyback to question it.\n\n\nThe wolf probably had a good time that night, but Remus didn\u2019t remember much about it. It all got lost in the blood red haze of transformation, the choking and clawing and groaning as he twisted back into his human form.\n\n\n\u201cUrrrgh!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got you, Moony,\u201d Sirius had him by the shoulders, pulling a cloak across his body. Remus forced his eyes open, knowing how little time there was.\n\n\n\u201cWand,\u201d he croaked, getting up. Sirius handed it to him. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go, now,\u201d Remus said, leaning on Sirius for support while he pulled his clothes on, hands shaking and fumbling with the buttons on his shirt and trousers.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going, just take a breath,\u201d Sirius said, his voice calm and firm. \u201cHold on to me, I\u2019ll apparate us\u2026\u201d\n\n\nSirius was as good as his word; he didn\u2019t try to dissuade Remus from going, or try to tell him what to do. He simply got them where they needed to be.\n\n\nFerox was there already.\n\n\n\u201cAll right, lads,\u201d he nodded, keeping his voice low. It was still quite dark under the grey Galloway sky, and the grasslands were cloaked in swaths of gauzy mist, the castle ruin rising from it black and foreboding. It was quiet, no birdsong, no noise at all. Like a place out of time.\n\n\n\u201cHave you seen anything?\u201d Remus asked, desperately. He could smell them, the scent was very strong.\n\n\n\u201cHeard a bit of noise; must have been them turning back.\u201d Ferox said. He gave Remus a look, \u201cYou ok, our kid? Looking a bit green about the gills.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Remus swallowed, \u201cFine. We should go in now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight you are. Wands out.\u201d Ferox straightened up and started forward, \u201cPity we couldn\u2019t get \u2018em when they were wolves, eh?\u201d He said, with a smirk, \u201cThose pelts fetch a few bob on the black market.\u201d\n\n\nRemus felt sick, the sweat on his back turned cold. Sirius reached for his hand in the dark and gave it a squeeze, then tossed his head and said sharply,\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say shit like that, it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\n\n\nFerox glanced back at him, shocked, then at Remus. He frowned,\n\n\n\u201cSorry lad, didn\u2019t mean anything by it.\u201d\n\n\nThey didn\u2019t say another word as they approached the castle. Sirius and Ferox were trying to be quiet, but Remus knew they may as well have been a herd of elephants sneaking up on Livia and Greyback, whose senses were as sharp as his, even after the full moon. Still, they might be slower; weaker.\n\n\nWhen they were up against the castle wall, Remus felt it. Greyback was waiting. The scent changed, and his head was filled with that dreadful growling voice,\n\n\n\nHello, cub\u2026 brought me breakfast, have you?\n\n\n\n\u201cHe knows we\u2019re here.\u201d Remus whispered, frantically, \u201cBe careful!\u201d\n\n\nFerox touched his brow in a sort of salute, to show he understood. Then he rounded the corner and entered, Remus hurrying behind, and Sirius too. Ferox had his wand raised, and as he stepped under the broken archway it the shadows of the ruin, he opened his mouth - he had planned to use the silver chain spell, to bind the werewolves and contain them long enough for the Auror\u2019s to take over - but it was too late.\n\n\nRemus was only a split second behind Ferox, and saw the rock come down. He stiffened, then crumpled to the ground, blood oozing from the a cut at the crown of his head.\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Remus cried, over Greyback\u2019s laughter as the beast of a man stepped into the early morning light, his face full of glee. Livia sprung out next, and lunged at Sirius, grabbing his wand and knocking him to the ground.\n\n\n\u201cOooooh, who\u2019s this then, brother? Pretty, pretty boy\u2026\u201d she crowed, sitting astride him, holding both of Sirius\u2019s wrists over his head as he struggled. She looked thinner, but was obviously as strong as ever.\n\n\n\u201cLet him go!\u201d Remus snarled, raising his wand, furious. Then he screamed in agony. Greyback grabbed his wand arm and twisted it so hard he felt the bone snap.\n\n\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Sirius called out.\n\n\nRemus was almost blind with pain, and Greyback laughed again, letting him go.\n\n\n\u201cWelcome back, cub,\u201d he purred. \u201cHow I\u2019ve missed you\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFuck you.\u201d Remus groaned, staring about for his wand, which he\u2019d dropped somewhere.\n\n\n\u201cNow now,\u201d Greyback chuckled, as Remus straightened up to face him, clutching his broken arm to his chest. \u201cYou should be on your hands and knees after what you did to me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cKill him, father!\u201d Livia cackled, \u201cKill the traitor Remus Lupin, just as he killed my brother Gaius! Then I can have the pretty one!\u201d\n\n\nGreyback grinned at her, fondly,\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s full of bright ideas, my beautiful girl.\u201d\n\n\nRemus took the opportunity to look over Greyback\u2019s shoulder - Ferox was moving. Very slowly; he was obviously hurt, but Remus saw his fist tighten around his wand.\n\n\n\u201cGo on then!\u201d Remus said to Greyback, gritting his teeth through the pain, \u201cKill me. Then what?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen what?!\u201d Greyback sneered, \u201cThen I rip apart your little human pet, that\u2019s what. Then I tear him limb from fucking limb - but not before I\u2019ve had my fun with him\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re disgusting!\u201d Remus shot back, stalling for time as Ferox\u2019s eyes opened. May as well tell Greyback what he thought of him, while he had the chance, \u201cYou\u2019re filth! You\u2019re nothing! You talk about freedom, but you don\u2019t have the first clue what it is! You\u2019re nothing but a bully! Voldemort\u2019s lapdog!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cKill him!\u201d Livia shrieked.\n\n\nGreyback\u2019s face had turned demonic with rage, yellow eyes glowing, and Remus really thought that would be the end. He scrunched his eyes shut and braced himself.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?! Argh!\u201d Livia cried out again, and Remus heard a dog bark.\n\n\nHe opened his eyes to see Livia knocked backwards by Padfoot, who was growling - Remus had never seen him growl before - teeth bared, frothing at the mouth.\n\n\n\u201cFather!\u201d Livia yelped, \u201cHelp m---\u201d\n\n\nAnd with a flash of purple light, Livia was silent. Her eyes went wide, a great black slash had cut her throat. She clutched at her neck to stem the gushing blood, but it was no good, it was too late.\n\n\nGreyback gave a great roar of anguish, but Ferox was already on his feet, wand up, ready to cast the same curse again. Greyback was cornered.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a dead man.\u201d He hissed at Ferox, and then, with one final snarl, he disapparated.\n\n\n\u201cBugger!\u201d Ferox grunted, stumbling forward, still poised to curse.\n\n\nSirius was Sirius again, and stood beside Livia, staring down at her. Remus went over too, feeling an uncomfortable mix of relief and genuine sorrow. Her grey fur cloak was matted with blood, which looked deep purple in the dim light. It was dreadful, but his first concern was for Sirius,\n\n\n\u201cOk?\u201d He asked, quietly.\n\n\nSirius nodded, still looking down. \u201cYou?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThink so.\u201d His arm was throbbing, sending shooting pains up into his shoulder; but he knew that could be fixed. Livia could not. Ferox joined them, a hand pressed to his head where the rock had struck him.\n\n\n\u201cMerlin, what a mess.\u201d He muttered. \u201cAt least we got the bitch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHer name\u2019s Livia.\u201d Remus said, angrily.\n\n\nHe suddenly saw the scene as a passerby might. Three men standing over her tiny body.\n\n\nShe could have ripped each of their throats out the night before without stopping for breath. She was a force of nature; queen of the night; she was one of the strongest people he had ever met. She was one of the only people in the world who truly understood what it meant to be a wolf.\n\n\nHer eyes were still open, staring blindly at the broad grey sky. Remus knelt beside her, and gently closed them."

Ferox summoned Moody to the scene, and he excused them. Remus wanted to ask about Livia\u2019s body - were they planning to bury her, at least? He didn\u2019t know if Livia had had any wishes regarding her final resting place, but he assumed she\u2019d prefer to be somewhere in nature; somewhere moonlight could reach her.\n\n\nMarlene came over the flat on her way to work to sort out his broken arm.\n\n\n\u201cThanks, Marls,\u201d he smiled weakly, \u201cI can do dislocations no problem, but broken bones\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t be doing spells on yourself, Remus,\u201d she chided, \u201cYou know you can always contact me, if you need to.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\nShe left a sleeping draught and some more of her own ointment for pain relief, and ordered him to stay in bed and do nothing useful or important for at least forty-eight hours.\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the next day, when Remus woke up after two in the afternoon, that he was suddenly gripped with terror at the memory of Greyback\u2019s last words.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to kill Ferox!\u201d He shouted, sitting up in bed.\n\n\nSirius came through from the living room, eyes wide with concern,\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe need to find Greyback!\u201d Remus said, climbing out of bed, limbs creaking, \u201cHe said he\u2019d kill Ferox!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMoony, it\u2019s all taken care of,\u201d Sirius said, placing cool hands on Remus\u2019s shoulders, smoothing down his arms in a comforting gesture, \u201cFerox is going to move to a safe house, he\u2019ll up his security and be extra vigilant, don\u2019t\n\n\nworry\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be enough,\u201d Remus shook his head, batting away Sirius\u2019s attempts to calm him, \u201cMoody and Ferox, they don\u2019t treat Greyback like a proper threat - look at what happened! He\u2019s more dangerous than they think, and now he\u2019s angry\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Moody knows that, even if Ferox is a bit cavalier about it.\u201d Sirius said. He was being so diplomatic; so reasonable, it was infuriating. \u201cHow are you feeling? I\u2019ll put the kettle on, why don\u2019t you have a bath? You\u2019ll feel better\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus did take a bath, because his muscles still hurt. He slathered on a bit of poultice afterwards, which at least meant he could straighten up fully. He refused to rest. All he wanted to do was check on Ferox - make sure he had the right security in place. After all, wasn\u2019t it Remus who\u2019d been doing all the grunt work on protection charms? It was within his remit, surely.\n\n\nIn the end, Sirius gave in and summoned Moody through the fireplace. The Auror\u2019s grizzled head hovered in the flames like a hideous easter egg.\n\n\n\u201cAll in hand, Lupin,\u201d he barked, \u201cYou can stand down.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut Mad-Eye,\u201d Remus pleaded, on his knees in front of the hearth, \u201cGreyback will find him, I know he will, he\u2019ll be able to follow the scent - if you just tell me where he is, then I can--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cClassified information.\u201d Moody snapped. \u201cEvery precaution has been taken. You can trust that the Auror\u2019s office can cope with a lone werewolf.\u201d\n\n\nRemus\u2019s temper rose, and he was about to retort, but Moody signed off. \u201cNo time for this, Lupin, it\u2019s been a busy week. Get some rest.\u201d\n\n\nRemus groaned furiously, slamming his fist on the rug.\n\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Sirius said, standing behind him, \u201cMoody\u2019s got it all sorted.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut I need to be sure,\u201d Remus said, climbing to his feet, \u201cThey don\u2019t understand, not really, not like\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot like\n\n\nyou\n\n\ndo?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus,\u201d Sirius\u2019s voice hardened, out of nowhere, \u201cYou need to be careful with that kind of talk. I think\u2026 I think you ought to put a lid on the werewolf stuff, for a bit.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Remus turned to look at him, blindsided. \u201c\u2018The werewolf stuff\u2019!? What\u2019s that supposed to mean? I\n\n\nam\n\n\na werewolf.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sirius bit his lip, \u201cBut you\u2019re a wizard too, and you\u2019re on\n\n\nour\n\n\nside. It just might be a good idea to focus on something else, you don\u2019t want anyone in the order to get the wrong end of the stick\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus gaped at Sirius as if he was a complete stranger.\n\n\n\u201cThe wrong end of the stick\u2026?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to upset you,\u201d Sirius said, choosing his words carefully, \u201cI\u2019m only warning you - things are bad enough already, no one trusts anyone. Frank told me Dumbledore thinks there\u2019s a spy in the Order, and if you keep bringing up how chummy you are with dark creatures then--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am not \u2018chummy\u2019 with dark creatures!\u201d Remus shouted. \u201cHow can you\u2026 unless you\u2019re saying\n\n\nI\u2019m\n\n\na dark creature too?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m not!\u201d Sirius returned, clearly offended, \u201cIt\u2019s just... you\n\n\nknow\n\n\nhow much prejudice there is, and it\u2019s not going to do you any favours to broadcast this weird connection you have with them. I\n\n\nsaw\n\n\nLivia, I\n\n\nsaw\n\n\nGreyback, you\u2019re nothing like them. Don\u2019t let people think you are.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHas somebody said something?\u201d Remus asked, wondering where this was coming from, \u201cWas it Danny, or--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 well, after you spent all that time with them, people have raised concerns, that\u2019s all. You can understand that, can\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo I can\u2019t! I was only with the pack because Dumbledore ordered it! Just like I\u2019ve always done everything Dumbledore\u2019s told me to!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know that\u2026\u201d Sirius looked away, as if embarrassed.\n\n\nHe tucked a strand of hair behind his ear. Remus knew that gesture. Sirius was nervous. He clenched his jaw.\n\n\n\u201cDo\n\n\nyou\n\n\ntrust me?\u201d He asked, knowing his body language was aggressive, but not willing to temper it.\n\n\nSirius looked up at him, blue eyes filled with alarm.\n\n\n\u201cOf course I do! It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d His eyes fell again, another swish of hair, \u201cYou\u2019ve always been good at keeping secrets, Moony\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus\u2019s mouth dropped open. He clenched his fists, then unclenched them.\n\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d He said, coldly. \u201cIf that\u2019s how you feel.\u201d\n\n\nHe turned and walked out of the flat. Sirius didn\u2019t try to stop him.\n\n\nRemus went to the nearest corner shop first, and bought an extremely cheap and nasty bottle of gin. Then the problem was where to drink it. He didn\u2019t want to look like an alkie, chugging hard spirits on the street in broad daylight. But then he didn\u2019t really have anywhere else to go, either.\n\n\nHe considered looking for Grant, but he didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d be working that day. Grant had moved back to London early in the spring, after too many times stuck on the late train back to Brighton. He was living in a bedsit somewhere north - but based on the telephone conversations they\u2019d had, he rarely slept there. Grant had a string of paramours, and if he wasn\u2019t attending a lecture he could usually be found bed hopping - or at work, in the Sawyer\u2019s Arms pub.\n\n\n\u201cVariety is the spice of life,\u201d he teased Remus, \u201cAnd I\u2019m crap on my own. Can\u2019t hack the quiet.\u201d\n\n\nRemus knew how that felt. A lot of the time it was the reason he drank. In the end, he decided he was too angry to be around anyone else, and went to hide in the park like a proper old waster. He ought to have gone to Grant\u2019s, he thought, once he was properly drunk; that would serve Sirius right.\n\n\nHe grieved for Livia, too; and made a silent toast. She\u2019d been cruel, yes, and a murderer. But none of it had been her fault, really - not if you went back far enough. She\u2019d been taken by Greyback before she was old enough to speak; when she was Harry\u2019s age, maybe. Livia had no choice but to become a killer, any more than Remus had a choice about his drinking.\n\n\nHe went home eventually, when it got too cold. He hadn\u2019t thought to bring a coat when he stormed out. Sirius was sitting on the couch, waiting for him, hands twisting anxiously in his lap. When Remus walked in, Sirius took one look at him, and - no doubt smelling the gin - shook his head, disappointed, and got up to make a pot of strong tea.\n\n\nThey didn\u2019t say much, and they never spoke about \u2018werewolf stuff\u2019 again.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nRemus did not celebrate Christmas 1980.\n\n\nIn fact, he did not see any of his friends, or Sirius, from the full moon, which fell on 21st December, until January. He spent it hiding in Moody\u2019s cellar, with Danny McKinnon.\n\n\nFerox was dead.\n\n\nNot just dead; destroyed; eviscerated. Ripped to pieces. According to the Daily Prophet, every wall of Ferox\u2019s house was splattered with blood. Moody said that the carpet was so saturated it squelched under their feet - the Aurors who\u2019d arrived on the scene.\n\n\nGreyback had made good on his promise, just as Remus had tried to warn them. But he couldn\u2019t bring himself to say \u2018I told you so\u2019. He was too angry. Angrier still, when Moody told him he\u2019d need to hide from the Ministry.\n\n\nFerox\u2019s murder spurred the wizarding public to demand a clampdown on werewolves. There were too many unregistered names; laws needed to be harsher; the register ought to be published. It was no longer safe - two days after Ferox\u2019s death hit the headlines, a known werewolf, Theodora Lupa, was attacked in her home. She was fully registered, and had spent the full moon locked up in the cells at the Ministry, but her innocence it meant nothing to the vengeful mob.\n\n\nWhat was more, the death eaters appeared to be using the excuse to stir up more bias against magical creatures - it was understood that Voldemort himself was offering a reward for information on the locations of any \u2018half-breeds\u2019.\n\n\nSo Remus was forced to hide.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll miss Harry\u2019s first Christmas.\u201d He said stupidly, as he packed his suitcase.\n\n\n\u201cJames and Lily will understand.\u201d Sirius said. He was watching Remus from the bed, pale with terror. \u201cWe all just want you safe.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Remus nodded. There was nothing more to say.\n\n\nThey shared a chaste kiss goodbye. Things hadn\u2019t been the same since Livia died, and news of Ferox\u2019s hellish demise had turned Remus completely numb.\n\n\nMoody was not much of a host. He blindfolded Remus and made him side-along, so he had no idea where he was. He saw none of the house - if it was a house - but the whole place reeked of black magic, so heavy and thick Remus thought he\u2019d choke on it.\n\n\nIn the cellar, his blindfold was removed, and it was a sorry sight. Danny sat on one rickety put-up bed, and there was another pushed back against the opposite wall. There were no windows, and the walls were bare brick. Moody had put aside some provisions - he explained that there were so many protection charms and cloaking spells on the cellar door that it took hours to enter or to leave, so it was best they just sat tight until he told them the coast was clear.\n\n\nRemus agreed, only because he knew that he could break the charms if he wanted.\n\n\nThere was a little toilet at the back with a sink - no shower, so they\u2019d have to do their best with a flannel and a bar of soap. The food was all dried stuff that didn\u2019t need too much preparation, and besides that there was nothing at all. Remus was just glad he\u2019d had the foresight to bring a few books. Not to mention the bottle of firewhisky he\u2019d stashed just in case.\n\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d Danny said, dully.\n\n\n\u201cHello.\u201d Remus nodded, as Moody locked the door at the top of the stairs.\n\n\n\u201cThis is shit, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus went over and set his suitcase beside his bed, then sat on it. It sagged heavily, and squeaked. A faint smell of mildew rose from it, which put him in mind of the Shrieking Shack.\n\n\n\u201cNever spent a Christmas away from my family.\u201d Danny said. \u201cEven when I was touring.\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded, glumly. He hadn\u2019t had Christmas without Sirius in almost ten years.\n\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t believe it when I heard about Leo Ferox. He was so\u2026 I dunno, I just really thought he\u2019d make it through the war. Did you er\u2026 know him well?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe was my Care of Magical Creatures professor,\u201d Remus offered. He wasn\u2019t quite sure it had sunk it yet. He didn\u2019t really feel very much, when he thought about Ferox; only a blurry sort of wistfulness.\n\n\n\u201cOh wow,\u201d Danny said, \u201cBet he was good at that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, he was,\u201d Remus gave a small smile, \u201cHad loads of good stories.\u201d He suddenly remembered Achilles, Ferox\u2019s kneazle - what had happened to it? He thought about Greyback, in full wolf form, coming across the sleek silver animal, and for the first time, his eyes filled with tears.\n\n\nBugger.\n\n\nWhy did this have to happen now\n\n\n? He thought, as his shoulders began to shake and he tried to get himself under control.\n\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t I get emotional at the flat, when it was just Sirius?\n\n\nSirius wouldn\u2019t care if he cried. It was no good. He covered his face with his hands and just waited for it to stop.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, Remus,\u201d Danny said, awkwardly. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise\u2026 he must have meant a lot to you.\u201d\n\n\nThat made Remus cry harder, because of course Ferox had meant a lot. He was Remus\u2019s first crush (not counting David Bowie, maybe), even if Remus hadn\u2019t fully understood it at the time. He was one of the first adults Remus trusted, who made him feel like a person with value. Maybe they\u2019d clashed a bit, as Remus had grown up, but no one was perfect.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he coughed, wiping his eyes with his sleeve, \u201cIt\u2019s been a bad year.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou can say that again.\u201d Danny said. \u201cOh, Marls says hello. You should\u2019ve seen her when Moody came for me, she was all set to come along too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Remus smiled, sniffing, \u201cThat sounds like her.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, she said to give you a hug and a kiss, so tell her I did, ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk,\u201d Remus laughed, feeling a bit more normal.\n\n\nThey pottered about a bit in their little living space. Remus tried not to think about the cell at St Edmund\u2019s, or the Shrieking Shack, or the crypt in the forest - every cage he\u2019d ever been forced into. He unpacked his clothes, then, finding nowhere to put them, re-packed them and slid his suitcase under the bed, leaving only his pyjamas out.\n\n\nThey had a little bit to eat - just some bread and cheese. Remus hadn\u2019t eaten any meat since hearing about Ferox.\n\n\n\u201cWhat were you going to do for Christmas, if you weren\u2019t stuck here?\u201d Danny asked, over supper.\n\n\n\u201cSpend it at the Potters.\u201d Remus replied, \u201cWith the new baby.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah, of course, you\u2019re all mates, aren\u2019t you,\u201d Danny nodded. \u201cMarlene talks about you all like you\u2019re celebrities.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHa.\u201d Remus grunted. \u201cMaybe James and Lily. And Sirius.\u201d\n\n\nDanny cleared his throat awkwardly.\n\n\n\u201cMarls said you and he were\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus just looked back at him, holding his gaze, allowing him to feel uncomfortable. Danny finally looked away, \u201cObviously that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine with Marlene and Yaz, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\nRemus just shrugged,\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like being a werewolf,\u201d he said, pulling the crust off his bread, \u201cEveryone\u2019s perfectly \u2018fine\u2019 with it, as long as you never bring it up.\u201d\n\n\nHe had a few leftover cigarettes, and would have liked one after dinner, but for one thing, he didn\u2019t want to share, and for another, there weren\u2019t any windows and it seemed a bit rude to smoke the place out.\n\n\nGod\n\n\n, he thought,\n\n\nthis is going to be agony\n\n\n.\n\n\nThings got even more awkward when it came time for bed. They were both yawning, and agreed it was quite late, and that they were tired. Remus began to take his socks off, and stood up to unbutton his trousers, when he realised Danny had not moved. He couldn\u2019t see why he was so shy; didn\u2019t quidditch players get undressed in front of each other all the time? James had been a borderline exhibitionist in the dorm room at Hogwarts. And surely Danny couldn\u2019t be shy about scars; Remus had heaps more than him.\n\n\n\u201cClose quarters.\u201d Remus commented, hoping to put Danny more at ease.\n\n\nDanny twisted his mouth, eyes flicking up and down Remus\u2019s height.\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 Just so you know, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got a problem with it\u2026 with you. But\n\n\nI\n\n\ndon\u2019t swing that way.\u201d Danny eyed him warily.\n\n\nRemus rolled his eyes.\n\n\n\u201cOh, poor me, whatever will I do?\u201d He drawled, then turned his back and got into his pyjamas.\n\n\nHe climbed into bed and rolled onto his side, facing the wall, to prove that he couldn\u2019t care less which way Danny \u2018swung\u2019.\n\n\nHave you\n\n\n\nseen\n\n\n\nmy boyfriend?!\n\n\nHe wanted to say.\n\n\nAs if I\u2019d be interested in you, you big lump.\n\n\n\nEventually, Danny undressed and got into bed too, then flicked out the light. Remus could hear his heart beating, and realised that Danny could probably hear his, too. They had even less privacy than they thought.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, Remus.\u201d Danny whispered, eventually, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything by it.\u201d\n\n\nThat echoed something Ferox had said, and Remus felt the sadness return. He rolled onto his back, and spoke to the ceiling,\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok. Forgotten.\u201d\n\n\nQuiet for a while. Remus waited, hearing Danny poised on the cusp of a question.\n\n\n\u201cDid he always know?\u201d Danny whispered. \u201cSirius?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Remus squinted over at him.\n\n\n\u201cYou know. Did he always know you were a werewolf?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh. Yeah - mostly. He worked it out, when we were twelve or something.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd he still\u2026 I mean you still got together.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Danny said, sounding very earnest, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to think\u2026 to think someone might be able to look past it, one day, you know?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be something people have to look past in order to love you.\u201d Remus said, fiercely, \u201cIt\u2019s part of who you are.\u201d\n\n\nDanny didn\u2019t reply.\n\n\nThings got a bit easier between them, after the first night, but they kept each other at a distance anyway. Remus did a lot of reading. Danny sometimes exercised, doing press ups or jogging on the spot. It was annoying, but Remus couldn\u2019t blame him.\n\n\nOn Christmas day, Remus couldn\u2019t take it any more, and whipped out the bottle of fire whisky. They both got extremely drunk, and spent all of Boxing Day hungover. The room stank.\n\n\nBy the 27th, they were climbing the walls. Remus had finished his books - Danny had even read one of them, and they\u2019d tried to have a conversation about it, but Danny knew so little about muggles that he hadn\u2019t really understood the plot.\n\n\n\u201cHow much longer can it be?!\u201d Danny said, exasperated. It was the 31st, the last day of the year. \u201cWhat if we\u2019re still here for the full moon?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s weeks away.\u201d Remus replied. He was lying on his back on his bed, an arm slung over his face. Danny snored, and kept him up all night. \u201cAnyway, we\u2019d be fine, best place for us.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat if we attack each other?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, I won\u2019t attack you if you don\u2019t attack me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou mean you can control it?!\u201d\n\n\nRemus sighed.\n\n\n\u201cYeah. You can too. Not around humans, but other animals. Other wolves, it\u2019s fine. Why\u2019d you think they live in packs?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI never really thought.\u201d Danny said. \u201cWhat was it like? The pack?\u201d\n\n\nRemus bit his lip. Should he lie? Or did Danny deserve to know?\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2026 wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought it would be.\u201d He said. That was the first time he\u2019d admitted it. \u201cObviously Greyback was\u2026 but the rest of them. The ones who split off - they were ok. They were like family.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell.\u201d Danny said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a family already.\u201d\n\n\nThat was how it went, with Danny. He wanted to know things - he wanted to learn from Remus, but if he heard anything that made him uncomfortable it was right back to self-loathing.\n\n\nRemus missed Sirius so much he swore he could feel it in his gut like hunger. He wanted so desperately to have someone he could really talk to; what a relief it would be to spend time with his best friend, to relax.\n\n\nI\u2019ll apologise,\n\n\nhe promised himself,\n\n\nI\u2019ll never get angry at him again. I\u2019ll kiss his feet and crawl over hot coals and broken glass if it\u2019ll get things back the way they were.\n\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t want to end up like Danny.\n\n\nThey were a week into the new year by the time Mad Eye finally came for them. They both caught his scent at once, and sat up, keenly staring at the door. They\u2019d almost run out of food by then, and Remus prayed this wasn\u2019t just a grocery delivery. He felt the charms being slowly undone, each layer peeling back. Finally, the door swung open, and the clunk of Moody\u2019s wooden leg on the first stair.\n\n\n\u201cAll right, boys?\u201d He called. \u201cReady to get back to work?\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nComing out of that cellar was like coming up for air. Remus felt as though all of his senses had been muted for weeks, and now everything was a riot of colour and noise and scent.\n\n\nMoody wasn\u2019t joking about getting back to work. He took them straight to a new safehouse, where the rest of the order were gathering for a meeting. Remus could smell Sirius as soon as he got in the door, and it made him so giddy with excitement that if he\u2019d had a tail it would have been wagging. He ran his fingers quickly through his greasy hair, and thought about how awful he must look.\n\n\nMoody led them down a corridor and - rather than going straight through to the kitchen, where they could hear everyone talking - veered into a small utility room, which had a muggle washing machine inside and a big pile of dirty towels in a basket.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bringing you through in a minute,\u201d he explained, \u201cMs McKinnon\u2019s been harassing me every day for the past two weeks to have you back, and Black\u2019s threatened me with every curse I\u2019ve ever heard of,\u201d he smirked indulgently. \u201cSo you\u2019re out now, but I need you both to listen, right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d They both nodded, blinking.\n\n\n\u201cThe danger hasn\u2019t passed. You\u2019re still under threat. I can\u2019t have either of you leaving your homes without a disguise. I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t leave at all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut how can we help the Order if--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty you can do,\u201d Mad-Eye raised a hand of warning, fixing Remus with a hard look, \u201cResearch, communications, tracking spells, what have you. Unless you were enjoying your cosy little break in my cellar?\u201d\n\n\nThey both shook their heads fiercely. No. Never.\n\n\n\u201cRight then.\u201d Moody nodded, business-like again. \u201cCome on, then,\u201d he pushed the door open and their filed out, following him to the kitchen. It was crowded with people, most of whom Remus knew, and they all turned as soon as the door opened, fifty pairs of eyes, all wide with mistrust and worry.\n\n\n\u201cDANNY!\u201d A blonde blur rushed past Moody and Remus and body-slammed Danny, winding him. He chuckled and hugged Marlene back,\n\n\n\u201cAll right, sis?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus?\u201d Sirius had stood up, and was crossing the room anxiously, climbing over chairs and squeezing past people who had to bend and twist out of the way, snatching back mugs of hot tea. He had to look down as he approached, so he didn\u2019t trip, and his hair fell in front of his face, swaths of black silk.\n\n\nAs he reached Remus, who was still standing half in the hallway, Sirius had to raise his arm and sweep his hair back, and Remus swore the room went completely silent for a moment, and the only sound was the frantic thudding of his own heart. He forgot to breathe, and gasped,\n\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d\n\n\nSirius smiled a little, and stepped forward, a hand on Remus\u2019s shoulder to push him out of the room, into the dark hallway. Away from everyone else, Sirius slid his hand up Remus\u2019s neck, into his hair, and kissed him on the lips - so beautifully.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nSpring 1981\n\n\nThe honeymoon period after Remus\u2019s hiding lasted well into February. Both of them were so apologetic, and so grateful to be together again, that for a while everything was wonderful - they were like teenagers again. Especially because Remus wasn\u2019t supposed to leave the flat, which meant that there really wasn\u2019t a lot else to do.\n\n\nSirius popped over to check on James and Lily and the baby every now and then, and he still had missions to go on - but he always rushed back to Remus as soon as he could. They spent days and evenings lounging in bed together, eating beans on toast and smoking and playing records. It was like living on a private island - they\u2019d even had to cut off the floo connection for safety\u2019s sake.\n\n\nLuckily, Remus was allowed to keep the telephone, his lifeline, and the others came over when they could. Mary visited on her way back from work at least twice a week, to avoid her noisy family.\n\n\n\u201cIt's bliss, over here,\u201d she smiled, sinking into the couch and closing her eyes. \u201cIf you had a telly I\u2019d never leave.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHa, I\u2019m working on it, trust me.\u201d Remus replied. \u201cIs it really bad at yours? Do you want to stay over a few nights?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d she opened her eyes, \u201cI want to be with my family. They keep me normal. It's just\u2026 you know, they don\u2019t know anything about the war - I don't\n\n\nwant\n\n\nthem to know, but\u2026 it\u2019s so hard.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry, love.\u201d Remus said, wistfully. \u201cWant a drink?\u201d\n\n\nMary gave him one of her long, gentle looks, tilting her head.\n\n\n\u201cNo, Remus,\u201d she touched his knee, \u201cIt's never a good idea to drink when you feel like this. It doesn\u2019t make things better, does it?\u201d\n\n\nRemus just shrugged. He didn\u2019t see what the big deal was. Mary just smiled again, and took a sip of her tea, and continued as if nothing had happened.\n\n\n\u201cAnyway, I can always pop to Darren\u2019s if I need a break from the kids.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDarren? That kid you were going out with in fourth year?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell remembered,\u201d she laughed, \u201cYeah, he still lives across the hall. I go over sometimes, we\u2019re friends.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust friends?\u201d Remus raised an eyebrow. Mary looked down, suddenly sad.\n\n\n\u201cYeah. That's all it can be, right now. He's a muggle, I\u2019m in the Order\u2026 I\u2019m already putting my family at so much risk, I couldn't bear if\u2026\u201d\n\n\nShe shook her head, her face resolute. \u201cSorry! I\u2019m supposed to be here keeping you company, not bringing you down!\u201d\n\n\nShe still didn\u2019t want to drink after that, but they had a nice long chat anyway. In hindsight, Remus would be glad that Mary was there that night, and that she stopped him getting drunk. Because that was the night James got hurt."

By now everyone had developed a fatalistic attitude to life, and a kind of gallows humour. \u201cSee you, later,\u201d Sirius would say, leaving the house, \u201cIf I make it.\u201d\n\u201cMeet you at home,\u201d James would tell Lily, \u201cIf it\u2019s still there!\u201d\nIt helped everyone get through it, at the time - after all, if you said the worst thing out loud, it couldn't hurt as much, could it? The thought tortured Remus for a long time after the war was over.\nThey were only supposed to be on a routine patrol - in Diagon Alley, which made Remus feel better because it was so close by. There were three of them, and they would be checking in with a senior Order member at the start and finish, so it should have been business as usual. In fact, Mary was about to leave Remus and go home for the night - when there was a hammering on the door.\nThey both jumped, and Mary let out a strange squeak of terror. Then the door began to open, and they both stood, wands raised, Remus covering as much of Mary as he could.\n\u201cHelp!\u201d A muffled voice came, and Sirius and Lily pushed their way into the flat, James\u2019s limp form sagging between them, an arm over each of their shoulders.\n\u201cChrist!\u201d Remus started forward to help, and between them all they got him onto the couch. \u201cWhat happened?!\u201d\n\u201cRemus,\u201d Mary choked, her wand still raised, hand trembling, \u201cThe questions\u2026\u201d\n\u201cRight, fuck, ok, um\u2026\u201d His mind was racing, he couldn\u2019t stop staring at James\u2019s face, pallid and waxy, gleaming with sweat. He looked at Lily, \u201cWhat did\u2026 um.. Who\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cLily, who was your first kiss?\u201d Mary stepped in, quickly.\n\u201cDirk Cresswell.\u201d Lily said, promptly. Sirius and Remus both gave her a funny look, but there was no time to make a fuss.\n\u201cSirius,\u201d Mary said, redirecting her wand, \u201cSame question.\u201d\n\u201cI don't know!\u201d Sirius said, exasperated, pulling away James\u2019s robes - there wasn\u2019t any blood, but James\u2019s eyes were closed, the lids deep purple, \u201cOne of you go and get McKinnon!\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know?!\u201d Mary rounded on him, \u201cAnswer the bloody question, Black!\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t, I really don\u2019t know! It was some muggle girl in a cinema! Moony, tell her!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s telling the truth,\u201d Remus said, his throat dry, \u201cHe is, we got into a fight over it. I punched him.\u201d\n\u201cPunched you back,\u201d Sirius muttered, scanning James with his wand. \u201cGet Marlene?! Please!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Mary said, backing out of the room, quickly. The door slammed and they heard a *CRACK* as she disapparated from the landing.\nLily came hurrying in from the bathroom, clutching a damp flannel. She knelt beside James and pressed it to his forehead,\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare, Potter,\u201d she whispered feverishly into his ear, \u201cDon\u2019t you bloody dare\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Remus grabbed Sirius\u2019s shoulder, \u201cAn attack?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius nodded, sweating and shaking. Remus wished he would sit down, but he knew there was no point saying so, \u201cAmbush. Six death eaters. Someone must have known we\u2019d be there, someone must have\ntold\u2026\n\u201d\n\u201cSirius!\u201d Lily shrieked, \u201cLook!\u201d\nShe had loosened James\u2019s shirt, and revealed long green coloured streaks, like tree branches stretching out beneath his skin. His breathing was shallow.\n\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Sirius crumbled, falling to his knees beside Lily, \u201cDid you hear what the curse was?\u201d\nLily shook her head, tears streaking down her face. James\u2019s breathing grew laboured, rasping in his throat, and he was limp as a rag doll.\nRemus\u2019s heart began to rattle in his chest, his vision swam and his knees went weak. Not James! He was the very best of them. He was the one who had to make it, no matter what. How could there be a world without James Potter? You might as well picture a world without kindness, or laughter, or mischief.\n\u201cFirewhisky.\u201d Remus said, suddenly, \u201cI\u2019ve got a bottle somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cNot\nnow\n, Moony!\u201d Sirius snapped, his face jagged as a demon\u2019s. Remus recoiled, hurt,\n\u201cI meant for Prongs! It might help the shock.\u201d\n\u201cTry it!\u201d Lily wailed, lifting the cold flannel on James\u2019s forehead to feel his skin. Remus could tell from a metre away that he had a temperature. \u201cTry anything!\u201d\nRemus ran, and while he was in the kitchen looking for a wooden spoon (he\u2019d heard that metal was bad for someone having a fit - they could hurt their teeth. James wasn\u2019t seizing, but better to be safe), Mary returned with Marlene. The whole atmosphere changed.\n\u201cOut of my way, please!\u201d Marlene\u2019s crystal clear voice rang out, its inherent common sense authority restoring order at once.\nRelieved, Remus came through clutching the firewhisky. Lily was crying harder now, standing back to let Marlene work. Sirius had his arms around her, eyes never leaving James\u2019s face, which was starting to turn a deathly shade of grey.\n\u201cMarls,\u201d Sirius said urgently, \u201cPlease\u2026 please\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m doing my best, Black!\u201d Marlene barked, turning to open her bag. Remus caught the flushed look of terror in her face, the shimmer of tears in her eyes. This was bad.\nIt was as if they were all holding their breath. Mary was still in her coat, pressed against the door.\n\u201cIs there someone else I can get?\u201d She asked, her voice hoarse. \u201cTell me, I\u2019ll go anywhere.\u201d\n\u201cI don't know,\u201d Marlene said trembling. \u201cThere's no one safe at St Mungo\u2019s, and I don\u2019t know if anyone else in the Order is\u2026 Emmeline, maybe, but she's in Hungary or somewhere\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou can do it though, Marls?\u201d Lily said, desperately, \u201cYou can heal him?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2026 What was the curse?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cIt was wordless.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about a bezoar?\u201d Mary asked.\n\u201cThat\u2019s for poison,\u201d Sirius shot back. \u201cHe was cursed.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but still, isn\u2019t it worth a try?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have one anyway!\u201d Marlene let out a sob. She was really crying, now, her hands hovering over James\u2019s body, shaking.\nHis breathing was coming slower and slower, Remus could still hear his heart beating, but that was getting weaker; a long syrupy \u2018thwump\u2019. They had to\ndo\nsomething.\n\u201cCan you describe the curse?\u201d He asked, brain ticking.\n\u201cIt was wordless!\u201d Sirius repeated, impatiently.\n\u201cNo, but could you\ndescribe\nit?\u201d Remus persisted, firmly. \u201cA light? Colour? A smell?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not like you, Remus, I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d Sirius ran his fingers through his hair, frowning,\n\u201cBlue.\u201d Lily said, sniffing, \u201cThere was a blue light, wasn\u2019t there Sirius?\u201d\n\u201cYeah!\u201d He nodded, lighting up, \u201cIt was blue, and kind of\u2026 Jagged? Short, like a dart.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lily wiped her eyes, looking at Remus as if he was her saviour, \u201cIt was like arrows being fired at us; blue arrows.\u201d\n\u201cOk,\u201d Remus nodded, as if he knew exactly what he was doing. He had never heard of a curse that did that. \u201cOk, so\u2026 blue\u2026 er\u2026\u201d\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Mary cried, \u201cBlue, isn\u2019t that explosive charms?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he jumped on it, eagerly, then frowned, \u201cBut he hasn\u2019t\u2026\u201d He looked down at James. He was completely intact - just incredibly weak.\n\u201cMaybe they combined it with something?\u201d Lily said, straightening up, folding her arms across her body and putting on her war face. \u201cMagical alchemy, you boys do that all the time.\u201d\n\u201cOr it could have been a mistake,\u201d Sirius said, leaning in, his eyes finally focussing properly, \u201cThat happens all the time too.\u201d\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Remus agreed, \u201cThe death eater might have just really wanted to use a lot of force, that can come out explosive sometimes\u2026 oh! Did you have shield charms up?\u201d\n\u201cWe did,\u201d Lily nodded, the lines in her forehead deepening, \u201cBut James - his had just dropped, just for a split second, he was trying to\u2026\u201d she looked down.\n\u201cHe was trying to protect me.\u201d Sirius said, very low. \u201cLast thing he did was disarm that fucking Crouch kid, he was about to get me with an unforgivable.\u201d\nRemus blinked with shock, and then shoved that feeling down, down as far as it would go, because he needed to deal with\nJames\nnow.\n\u201cOk,\u201d he swallowed. \u201cOk, so what if whoever hit James was just a bit slow? Tried to get through the shield charm just the second it went down.\u201d\n\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Lily said, her face bright with tears and sweat and hope, \u201cThat accounts for the short bursts!\u201d\n\u201cOk, great!\u201d Remus looked down at Marlene, who was staring at him eyes as big as saucers.\n\u201cWhat do I do, Remus?\u201d She said, her voice very small - as if they were back in the library at Hogwarts and she didn\u2019t understand a transfiguration principle.\n\u201cI\u2026 how would that hit him?\u201d Remus asked, agitated -\nhe\ndidn\u2019t know what to do!\nShe\nwas the one with two years training as a Healer! \u201cWhat would it do?! Think!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m trying!\u201d Marlene said, still shaking.\nRemus wanted to take her by the shoulders and\nreally\nshake her - she had to get herself together! This was James! He had a family, and a baby, and Sirius needed him, and\nRemus\nneeded him, they all did! Marlene just kept staring at them all, frozen.\n\u201cMarls,\u201d Mary came over, quickly, squatting down next to her friend. She did take Marlene by the shoulders - but she didn\u2019t shake her. She hugged her, and stroked her hair. \u201cSweetheart,\u201d she whispered into the silent room, \u201cYou can do this. You're the cleverest person I know. If anyone knows what to do, it\u2019s you. Ok?\u201d\nMarlene shut her eyes for a moment, and breathed in, deeply. She opened them and nodded,\n\u201cRight.\u201d She said, turning back to James. \u201cIt would have been hard, right in the chest\u2026 it would have... yes! Yes, it\ndoes\nmake sense!\u201d\nShe began to mutter to herself, and then moved her wand, a warm, soft lilac glow emanating from the point, pooling over James\u2019 prone body, sinking in slowly, like foam.\nThey all held their breath once more, while Marlene worked. Sirius was holding Lily\u2019s hand, and Remus could see her knuckles turn white as she gripped him back. Mary stayed by Marlene\u2019s side, kneeling on the rug beside the couch, her head bent as if praying.\nRemus just clutched his bottle of whisky and felt as though the world was falling out from under him. There was nothing to do but watch and wait, listen to Marlene\u2019s steady muttering, and try to keep perspective.\nThe magic she was using had a sweet, fresh scent, like cut grass, or budding leaves. The smell of springtime, of regeneration. That was a good sign, Remus thought. He wished he had learnt more from the werewolves - their healing techniques had been flawless. But maybe that only worked on other werewolves?\nJames\u2019s breathing was getting steadier, his heart rate a bit stronger.\nWoosh - woosh - woosh\n- Remus could hear his blood pumping faster already.\n\u201cIt\u2019s working!\u201d He said, going a bit closer to hear better. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it, Marlene!\u201d\n\u201cOh thank you,\u201d Lily said, covering her eyes with her hands, \u201cThank you, thank you\u2026\u201d\nMarlene stopped muttering and felt James\u2019s pulse. She sighed with relief and nodded,\n\u201cStable.\u201d She said. Then, looking up, \u201cMight as well give him a bit of that whisky, Remus.\u201d\nAfter they\u2019d got a bit of that down him, Marlene gave James a strengthening potion. He was getting a bit of colour back, by then, and his chest was rising and falling evenly. They were out of the woods. Still, Marlene didn\u2019t want him moved, not until he\u2019d regained consciousness.\n\u201cHe can stay here,\u201d Remus said, \u201cOf course he can. It\u2019s safe, isn\u2019t it, Padfoot?\u201d\nSirius was watching Remus, across the room. He was thinking, Remus could tell - he had his problem-face on. For some reason, it made Remus go cold. \u201cPadfoot?\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Sirius said, slowly, \u201cBut we thought Diagon Alley was safe enough.\u201d\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s here now,\u201d Lily said, getting up from James\u2019s side. \u201cHe\u2019s staying. I have to go home - Peter\u2019s looking after Harry, he must be so worried! I\u2019ll be right back\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSomeone should go and get Dumbledore.\u201d Sirius said, abruptly.\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d Mary asked.\n\u201cJust\u2026 he ought to know we were attacked. He ought to know somebody told the death eaters where we\u2019d be.\u201d\n\u201cSirius!\u201d Mary stared at him, her mouth open, \u201cAre you saying\u2026 someone in the Order?!\u201d\nSirius nodded. He didn\u2019t look at Remus again.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go!\u201d Remus offered.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Sirius said. \u201cYou can\u2019t, you\u2026 you need to stay here. It\u2019s not safe for werewolves.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to be safe for anyone!\u201d Marlene retorted, standing up, wiping her forehead. \u201cYou go, Sirius, since it\u2019s so important. Remus, Mary and I can stay and look after James.\u201d\nSirius looked at James, and then at Remus - not his face, though, just his general direction.\n\u201cOk,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be really quick.\u201d And headed out the door.\nThe three women looked at Remus awkwardly. Lily came over to squeeze his shoulder, and said gently,\n\u201cHe\u2019s just upset, love. He blames himself for what happened - James was trying to save him when he got hit. Don\u2019t take it personally, eh?\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Remus raised his chin, manfully, squashing down all of the bitter, rotten emotions, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019re all in shock. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to go,\u201d Lily said again, \u201cHarry.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll come with you,\u201d Mary said, \u201cWe should go everywhere in pairs. That\u2019s what Moody would say.\u201d\nThey both left, and Remus tried not to think about the fact that Sirius had vanished into the night completely alone.\nMarlene had collected herself by now, and was bustling about making James comfortable,\n\u201cI should have told Lily to bring him some pyjamas\u2026 maybe she will anyway,\u201d she said, \u201cHave you got a pillow and some blankets for him, Remus?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, \u2018course.\u201d Remus nodded, hurrying to the bedroom, coming back with five blankets and two pillows (they were the only pillows they had, actually; he\u2019d taken them right off the bed).\nMarlene was checking James\u2019s pulse again when he came back.\n\u201cIs he ok?!\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Marlene nodded, \u201cStill steady. I was just checking\u2026\u201d\nThey made up a bed on the couch around him. Remus took his shoes off, but they decided to wait until Lily was back to undress him. He looked as though he was just sleeping. Remus smiled,\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard James be so quiet for so long,\u201d he commented, hoping to lighten the mood a bit.\n\u201cHa.\u201d Marlene said, then burst into tears again.\n\u201cHey hey hey!\u201d Remus pulled her to him, \u201cIt\u2019s over now! Please don\u2019t cry\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m - sorry - I\u2019m - just - so - scared -\u201d Marlene sobbed, choking on every breath, \u201cI let - everyone - down!\u201d\n\u201cNo you didn\u2019t!\u201d Remus felt horribly guilt for shouting at her, \u201cYou did an amazing job!\u201d\n\u201cOnly - because - you lot - helped\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell, obviously,\u201d he kissed the top of her head, \u201cThat\u2019s what friends are for.\u201d\n* * *\nLily and Mary returned first. Lily cradling Harry in her arms - who was sleeping, mercifully. She went straight to James\u2019s side once more.\n\u201cI brought some of Effie\u2019s potions,\u201d She said, harried, \u201cHave a look, Marlene, there might be something useful\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to dose him up too much,\u201d Marlene said, carefully. \u201cRest and observation is the best thing now, I promise.\u201d She had washed her face and had a nip of whisky, and was considerably calmer now.\n\u201cDid you see Wormtail?\u201d Remus asked.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Mary said, taking Harry from Lily, so that she could focus on James. \u201cHe was really upset - he wanted to go home and check on his mum. Can\u2019t blame him.\u201d\n\u201cNo, of course.\u201d Remus agreed. He\u2019d want his mother, too, if he had one.\nHe made a strong pot of tea, and everyone took a cup, but nobody drank any. Marlene and Lily poured over James , undressing him and tucking him into bed, plumping up his pillow, while Mary gently rocked Harry in her arms. Remus watched the three of them - like saintly maidens in a church altarpiece - and felt completely useless.\n\u201cCould we move him to the bed?\u201d He said, annoyed he\u2019d only just thought of it, \u201cThen you can sleep next to him, Lily.\u201d\n\u201cBetter not for now,\u201d Marlene advised.\n\u201cRight, then I\u2019ll make you up a bed here\u2026\u201d he tried to remember some transfiguration charms - though conjuring furniture was usually something Sirius was better at.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Remus, I\u2019m not going to sleep.\u201d Lily smiled, tiredly.\n\u201cI don't think any of us will.\u201d Mary said. \u201cI phoned mum. All right if I stay here too, love?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d He nodded. And of course Marlene wouldn\u2019t be going anywhere until she was certain James was going to make a full recovery.\nIn the end, they agreed they\u2019d sleep in shifts, and take the bed two at a time. None of them wanted to go first, of course, and they all settled in for a very long night. Remus leaned against the mantlepiece, listening to James\u2019s heart beating across the room. He kept picturing his friend suddenly sitting up, grinning at them all;\nAlright you lot? Bloody hell, who died?!\nFinally, Sirius returned with Dumbledore, and any peace they had managed to reclaim was shattered.\n\u201cI need to know everything.\u201d The old headmaster said, his face severe, eyes burning like the blue centre of a flame.\nSirius and Lily began talking. They explained how everything had been routine - standard; boring, if anything. They\u2019d done a sweep of Diagon Alley, even Knockturn Alley, and found everything perfectly safe and secure.\nThen they\u2019d left, via the Leaky Cauldron exit, and had decided to walk to the check-in point, as it was a nice evening, and not too far. They were supposed to meet Dorcas Meadowes in a muggle caf\u00e9 on Tottenham Court Road - but they\u2019d been ambushed before reaching it.\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have been followed?\u201d Dumbledore asked, looking at them both. They shook their heads.\n\u201cWe made sure,\u201d Lily said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t behind us, they were ahead - they were\nwaiting\nfor us.\u201d\n\u201cShit, someone ought to tell Dorcas\u2026\u201d Sirius said, suddenly, \u201cAfter James got\u2026 we had to get out fast, there wasn\u2019t time.\u201d\n\u201cIt would not have mattered,\u201d Dumbledore waved a hand, \u201cDorcas Meadowes is dead.\u201d\nThe room fell silent. Harry woke up and started to cry. Lily took him from Mary at once, clutching her son close to her chest.\nSirius spoke first.\n\u201cI'm right, aren't I?\u201d He looked Dumbledore directly in the face, \u201cThere\u2019s a spy in the Order.\u201d"

He was moved back to the Potter house the next day (waking up groggy, unable to say very much, quickly falling back to sleep), but Dumbledore declared this a temporary solution. He told Lily to prepare to leave at a moment\u2019s notice.\nAfter months of being regarded as junior members of the Order, the marauders and their friends suddenly had all eyes on them.\nAt the next Order meeting, which James insisted on attending despite his weakened state, there were definitely whispers.\nSeven kids - three of them wealthy heirs to pureblood houses, two muggle born, \u00a0a werewolf, a novice Healer - what made them so special? Could they be trusted? They had survived the war so far, against all the odds. Were they just lucky, or was there something more to it? Who\nwere\nthese kids, who had escaped six death eaters and somehow reversed an almost incomprensible curse?\nThe had gathered in a small cottage, somewhere in the Peak District. It was a small living room, but the Order was small by then.\nAt the end of the regular meeting - which had really become more of a remembrance service for people they\u2019d lost since the last time they\u2019d met - Dumbledore asked Lily and James to stay behind while everyone else headed home. In turn, James asked Remus, Sirius and Peter to stay.\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Sirius whispered, urgently, \u201cAfter everything that\u2019s happened\u2026?\u201d\n\u201c--After everything that\u2019s happened I want my best friends nearby.\u201d James replied. Remus felt a swell of pride at that - to James, good sportsmanship extended to every element of his life. To mistrust the people he loved would be highly dishonourable.\nSirius folded his arms, but didn\u2019t argue.\nJames sat in a chintz armchair, his back straight, his face set. He looked perfectly healthy, unless you really knew him. His cheeks were more hollow, his skin paler, and - though everyone was pretending they hadn\u2019t noticed - his jet black hair now had a few threads of grey. Lily had brought a blanket to lay over his lap, but he kept pushing it off, irritably.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he muttered under his breath. \u201cLeave me be!\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be like that!\u201d Lily hissed back. She was looking a lot paler, too, her tired face lined with worry. Remus had never seen Lily and James snap at each other before. It felt horrible.\nHarry was fussing, flailing his arms and making a face. Lily was taking no chances now - they went everywhere as a family, or nowhere at all.\n\u201cShh,\u201d she jiggled him on her hip, \u201cQuiet now, Mummy and Daddy are busy...\u201d\n\u201cGive him here,\u201d Sirius held out his arms, \u201cWe\u2019ll have a little play, won\u2019t we Harry?\u201d He lifted the little boy up, and Harry squirmed and giggled delightedly.\nHe wasn\u2019t saying many words yet - \u2018Da-da\u2019, \u2018Ma-ma\u2019, \u2018No!\u2019 and, for some reason, \u2018bike!\u2019 were about the extent of it. But he knew his godfather. Remus wondered if it was the smell of old leather. His own experiences with Harry were hit and miss. They got on ok until the kid started crying - and Remus was no good at pretend play, like Sirius was.\nThe pair settled down on the living room floor, Sirius with his legs splayed out, Harry between them. Sirius pulled a little toy train out of one of his jacket pockets, and Harry began pushing it across the bumpy rug, burbling happily to himself. Sirius beamed at him. He was so good with children. Remus felt a weird sense of dissonance - did Sirius want kids of his own, one day? They\u2019d never discussed it, and Remus had never had the slightest interest. He didn\u2019t feel qualified to be a parent, and he wasn\u2019t sure he ever would.\nMaybe it was that, then. Maybe that was why Sirius was acting so strangely?\nRemus\u2019s private worries were interrupted then, by Dumbledore, who cleared his throat, commanding everyone\u2019s attention.\n\u201cWe have reason to believe,\u201d he said, quite calmly, \u201cThat Voldemort\u2019s focus has changed.\u201d\nEveryone looked up, even Sirius.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve received some information that the Dark Lord has become aware of a prophecy that was made early last year, which seemed to refer directly to him.\u201d\n\u201cA prophecy?\u201d Peter leaned forward, \u201cWhat prophecy? What did it say?\u201d\n\u201cIt is better that we share only the most pertinent details,\u201d Dumbledore said sharply, \u201cParticularly in mixed company.\u201d\nEveryone looked around the room. Remus felt a bit queasy - he did not consider the people congregated to be \u2018mixed company\u2019. They were his friends; his comrades, and the people he trusted with his life. He tried to catch Sirius\u2019s eye, hoping for some reassurance, but Sirius quickly looked away.\n\u201cSo he\u2019s changed his focus,\u201d James said, breaking the discomforting quiet, \u201cWhat does he want now?\u201d\n\u201cIn short, Mr Potter,\u201d Dumbledore said, directly, \u201cHe wants you. Or rather, your son.\u201d\nLily let out a horrible gasp, her hand flying to her mouth. James gripped the arms of his chair. Peter had an odd sort of nervous spasm. Sirius gathered Harry up and stood at once, \u201c\nWhat?!\n\u201d\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Dumbledore said, steadily, \u201cBut I have it on very good authority--\u201d\n\u201c\nWho\u2019s\nauthority?\u201d Lily asked, sounding strangled.\n\u201cThat I cannot say. I will not place anyone else in danger.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a spy, then,\u201d Peter said, wringing his hands anxiously, \u201cOn their side, I mean?\u201d\n\u201cI cannot say.\u201d Dumbledore repeated.\n\u201cWell you\u2019d better say\nsomething\nuseful!\u201d James returned, almost shouting, \u201cWhat do you mean my son?! How can Voldemort even\nknow\nabout Harry?!\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t trust anybody.\u201d Sirius said, quietly.\nJames turned to look at him, a look of pure disbelief. Inwardly Remus was relieved. James trusted his friends - of course he did. Sirius was being paranoid.\n\u201cBut why Harry?!\u201d Lily asked, shrilly.\n\u201cVoldemort believes that Harry will one day grow up to defeat him.\u201d\n\u201cIs that what the prophecy said?\u201d\nDumbledore inclined his head slightly, as if considering this.\n\u201cIt is what Voldemort believes.\u201d He said, eventually. \u201cAnd that is the same thing.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to hide,\u201d Sirius said, talking directly to James now,\u201cAll three of you. There have to be more charms - stronger magic we haven\u2019t tried yet - we\u2019ll send you to bloody Timbuktu if we have to!\u201d\n\u201cPadfoot,\u201d James said, raising a hand, \u201cCalm down.\u201d\n\u201cI will not!\u201d Sirius shouted, red in the face. For a weird split-second, Remus didn\u2019t recognise him at all.\nHarry started crying, reaching for his mother. Lily took him and cuddled him close, kissing his fine black hair and whispering soothing nonsense.\n\u201cSirius is right,\u201d Dumbledore said, still infuriatingly calm, \u201cYou will have to hide. Plans are already in motion.\u201d\n\u201cHow soon can we go?\u201d James asked. \u201cToday?\u201d\n\u201cSoon.\u201d Dumbledore said. \u201cI will come for you.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d James nodded. \u201cOk. Right. Good.\u201d\n\u201cYou will all remain vigilant, I trust,\u201d Dumbledore continued, beginning his closing address. He looked at each of them, as if to impress the gravity of the situation. When he met Remus\u2019s eyes, Remus made sure to stare back, and tried to transmit an aura of reliability and strength. Dumbledore gave the briefest of nods, before moving on to Peter.\n\u201cAnd none of you will share this information with anyone outside of this room.\u201d\nThey all nodded. Remus\u2019s head was spinning - if Lily and James went into hiding, what did that mean? Would they be stuck in Moody\u2019s cellar, like he\u2019d been? He dearly hoped not, he wouldn\u2019t wish that on anybody, least of all his best friends and their baby.\nOnce Dumbledore had left, they walked out of the cottage, into the thick amber evening sunlight, and looked at each other again. Harry had fallen asleep by now, nestled in Lily\u2019s robes, one chubby hand fisting her long red plait.\n\u201cYou\u2019d better all come over for dinner,\u201d James said, with a strained smile. \u201cJust in case we don\u2019t get another chance.\u201d\nA lump developed in Remus\u2019s throat, and lodged there for the rest of the night.\nStill, they had a nice time. Gully the house elf prepared a full Sunday roast at short notice - glorious roast beef, golden roast potatoes and fluffy yorkshire pudding, two kinds of stuffing, mouth-watering rich dark gravy, carrots, parsnips, peas, broccoli\u2026 Remus hadn\u2019t eaten on that scale since Hogwarts.\nBefore they began, James raised his glass to toast,\n\u201cTo our friends,\u201d he said, shooting a slightly pointed glance at Sirius, \u201cWho\u2019ve always been there for us, through thick and thin - Lily, Harry and I love you all so much.\u201d\nRemus had to excuse himself after draining his glass. He spent a few minutes composing himself in the downstairs loo. When he came out, and returned to the table, Sirius was watching him again, his eyes narrow, his mouth an inscrutable straight line.\n* * *\nWednesday 10th June 1981\nTwo days later, Sirius disappeared in the night. He must have crept away deliberately, because Remus didn\u2019t even realise until he woke up the next morning, and rolled into the cold empty pillow. He sat up, confused.\n\u201cSirius?\u201d He called to the rest of the flat. It was empty.\nHe got up and went to the living room, and checked the kitchen - sometimes they left each other notes. There was nothing. But Sirius\u2019s shoes were gone, and the keys to the bike, so he must have left of his own free will, at least.\nRemus sat at the kitchen table and waited, chain smoking. He wanted to contact someone, but there wasn\u2019t anyone who he was sure he could trust - Sirius\u2019s conspiracy theorising was starting to get to him.\nFinally, the front door clicked open, and Sirius\u2019s familiar footfall could be heard entering the flat. Remus almost got up and ran to meet him - but he had been treating Sirius with kid gloves ever since James\u2019s attack.\n\u201cMoony?\u201d\n\u201cIn here.\u201d\n\u201cOh, hello,\u201d Sirius stood in the kitchen doorway. He looked flushed - he must have been on the bike. \u201cAll right?\u201d\n\u201cWhere have you been? I was worried!\u201d\n\u201cSorry.\u201d He pulled a face and came to sit down at the table too. Remus watched him. He seemed happy. His hair smelled of the countryside, and he was sweating a bit through his black t-shirt - it was gearing up to be a very warm summer. He picked up the cigarette packet, took one out with his teeth and snapped his fingers to light it.\nRemus waited patiently.\n\u201cIt happened,\u201d Sirius said, finally, his face shining strangely, pearlescent in the weak light of morning. \u201cThey\u2019re hidden.\u201d\n\u201cLily and James?\u201d Remus squinted, scratching his head, \u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cDumbledore sorted it all.\u201d\nWhy didn\u2019t you take me with you?\nRemus wanted to ask, before scolding himself for having such a selfish thought. That wasn't the important bit. \u201cIs it safe? I gave James a whole scroll of security charms to use, did he--\u201d\n\u201cThey won\u2019t need any of that,\u201d Sirius waved a hand. He seemed weirdly triumphant, as if he had just bested Remus at a game of chess. \u201cDumbledore came up with something better.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThe fidelius charm.\u201d\n\u201cThe\u2026\u201d Remus frowned. He vaguely remembered having read about that\u2026 something to do with implanting a secret into another person. It was powerful stuff, he knew that much. No one would be able to break it, except the secret keeper themselves. \u201cWell, that\u2019ll do it, I suppose.\u201d He said. \u201cBut wouldn\u2019t they need someone to put the secret\nin\n?\u2026 is it Dumbledore?\u201d\n\u201cHe volunteered,\u201d Sirius said. \u201cBut in the end, we thought it was better if it was one of us.\u201d\n\u201cOne of us..?\u201d It dawned on Remus all of a sudden, as if Sirius had dumped a bucket of ice over his head. \u201cNo.\u201d Remus said, shaking his head.\nSirius was staring at him intensely, his eyes dark blue and more serious than they had ever been. Remus wanted to hit him. Shake him. Wring his neck. Anything to get some sense in his stupid thick skull. \u201c\nNo\n.\u201d He said again. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous!\u201d\n\u201cMoony\u2026\u201d Sirius started,\n\u201cDon\u2019t you \u2018Moony\u2019 me!\u201d Remus said sharply, standing up. He had to pace; had to move, just to keep up with his thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid! It\u2019s the stupidest idea you\u2019ve ever had!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\nmy\nidea--\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t volunteer!\u201d Remus rounded on him, furious, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t jump at the chance!\u201d\n\u201cTo help my best friends?! To help\nHarry?!\nOf course I did!\u201d Sirius was shouting too, and it was awful.\n\u201cFind someone else!\u201d Remus begged, \u201cAnyone!\nI\u2019ll\ndo it!\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d Sirius shook his head, \u201cIt has to be me, you know it does.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just keep saying \u2018no\u2019. It\u2019s done. It\u2019s dealt with.\u201d\nRemus really thought he was going to hit Sirius for a moment. Hit him, or burst into tears like a child. He did neither. He sat down, hard, and covered his face with his hands.\n\u201cYou bastard.\u201d He muttered.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be ok. I\u2019ve made sure.\u201d Sirius said, reaching out to him. Remus batted his hand away.\n\u201cYou just did it?! Without even telling me?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you now!\u201d\nRemus glared at him. He was going to say something he regretted, in a minute. If he didn\u2019t leave, he was going to say something he could never take back. He swallowed his rage, stood up, and walked out of the flat.\n* * *\nFriday 24th July 1981\nSo it was done. After that argument, everything happened very quickly. There were no goodbyes, Lily, James and Harry simply vanished without a trace. Remus knew better than to ask where they were - he wanted them to be safe, after all. And he wanted Sirius to be safe.\nThe Order was told that the Potters had gone into hiding; that Voldemort was after them because of Lily\u2019s blood status, and her marriage to James.\n\u201cIt\u2019s awful, not trusting anyone, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Peter said as they left that meeting.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus agreed glumly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s necessary.\u201d Sirius said. \u201cAnd if I knew who the spy was, I\u2019d kill them myself. I wouldn\u2019t even need magic.\u201d\nPeter and Remus stared at him, shocked.\n\u201cSirius,\u201d Remus said, putting a hand on is shoulder, \u201cWe can\u2019t start acting like death eaters - James wouldn\u2019t want--\u201d\n\u201cJames doesn\u2019t want his child to be murdered by a lunatic on a power trip!\u201d Sirius ranted, jerking away from Remus\u2019s touch, \u201cYou\u2019ve gone soft, Moony.\u201d\nIf I have,\nRemus though to himself,\nit\u2019s because of you\n. No one fell in love with a hard heart; he\u2019d learnt that lesson more than once.\nStill, as dreadfully as Sirius was acting, Remus was inclined to make some allowances. It was a very difficult time - the darkest point in the war - and everyone was handling the pressure differently. Peter and Marlene threw themselves into work - they were rarely seen not rushing to one place or another. Mary seemed to withdraw into the muggle world more - she was always around when you needed her, but her mind often seemed to be in two places. Remus had his drinking and his self-pity. So if Sirius wanted to be the angry one for a bit, fine.\nBut it was still a war - war does not make allowances, or give anyone time to catch their breath. It is relentless and unforgiving, and unimaginably cruel.\nIt was only a week or so before Harry\u2019s first birthday. Sirius had just got in from Diagon Alley - he\u2019d gone in search of something appropriate for a one year old, and instead returned with an actual broomstick.\n\u201cSirius!\u201d\n\u201cOh come on, Moony, it\u2019s only little!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a baby!\u201d\n\u201cGot to train him young if he\u2019s ever going to play for England!\u201d\nRemus laughed indulgently, and sipped his tea while he watched Sirius wrap the toy. He hadn\u2019t seen him so happy in a while, and it was so nice. Then it happened.\nThere was a strange scent, first, which only Remus picked up. Familiar and friendly, magical. Then, in a flash of bright light, an enormous silver patronus burst through the wall. It was a lioness, and it prowled the room, snarling,\n\u201cFucking hell!\u201d Sirius leapt up, backing away.\nThe huge cat looked at them both with plaintive eyes, and opened its mouth. The scream with emanated from it was bone-chilling, and all too familiar. It was Mary.\n\u201cHelp!\u201d It wailed, \u201cHollyhock House!\u201d\nAnd then it vanished.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the McKinnon\u2019s address.\u201d Remus said, getting up to put his shoes on.\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Sirius asked.\n\u201cTo help Mary!\u201d Remus said, impatiently, fumbling with his laces, \u201cCome on!\u201d\n\u201cMoony, no,\u201d Sirius said, \u201cWe can\u2019t, we have to follow protocol, contact Moody, or Arthur, or FRank, or--\u201d\n\u201cFuck protocol!\u201d Remus shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s Mary! She asked for help and I\u2019m going. Stay here if you want.\u201d\nOf course Sirius didn\u2019t stay.\nThey arrived outside Hollyhock House maybe ten minutes after getting Mary\u2019s patronus. Neither of them had ever been to Marlene\u2019s home before, though she\u2019d described it a few times. It was a lovely old tudor style cottage, located a few miles outside of a village in Sussex. There was a long garden path, with a border of bright pansies and geraniums - red, purple, yellow, pink. The front door was painted a soft dusky green, and if you craned your neck you could just make out the tops of three quidditch hoops in the back garden.\nIt might have been pretty, anyway. But not today.\nMary was standing at the top of the path by the roadside, frozen, staring blankly up at the blue sky. The dark mark hung over the yellow thatched roof; an enormous black cloud, the unmistakable shapes of skull and snake.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Remus gasped. Mary turned to him with tears in her eyes,\n\u201cThey\u2019re all dead.\u201d She said.\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Sirius said, taking a few steps up the path, wand raised.\n\u201cYes.\u201d She said, \u201cYes, they\u2019re all lined up very neatly.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He looked back at her, frowning.\n\u201cLined up\u2026 in a row\u2026\u201d she repeated. She swayed for a moment, and Remus put his arms around her, in case she was going to faint. She leaned into him, weeping silently.\n\u201cStay with her.\u201d Sirius said, continuing up the path. Remus began to tremble. It was like a nightmare; like a horror film. He watched Sirius approach the door, push it open, call inside.\n\u201cWe were supposed to meet for lunch today, but she never came,\u201d Mary whispered against Remus\u2019s shoulder, still clinging to him, \u201cI thought she was just busy at the hospital\u2026 I tried to find her after work, but they said she\u2019d never gone in\u2026 so I came here and I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d Remus said, because what else do you say?\n\u201cThe mark was there, and the door was open, and\u2026 oh god, Remus! All of them! Her mum, and her stepdad, and Yaz, and Danny\u2026 just lying there! Oh my god, their eyes!\u201d She began to sob in earnest, and Remus held her tighter, feeling his insides turn to water.\nSirius came out of the house. Even at a distance, Remus could see the look of horror on his face. He made his way quickly towards them.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get Moody,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be back as soon as possible, ok? ...don\u2019t go in there.\u201d\nAnd with that, he disappeared with a loud *CRACK*.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Mary cried, hysterical, \u201cIt\u2019s over, I can\u2019t do this anymore!\u201d"

There were theories, of course; the most logical being that with Danny and Marlene in the Order, they were simply an obvious target. Some people wondered if it was because of Marlene\u2019s connection to James and Lily - because she\u2019d healed James. Others thought she\u2019d made too much fuss about werewolf rights at work.\nIn the end, none of it mattered, not to Remus. Why try to make sense out of something so senseless?\nDue to Danny\u2019s previous celebrity status, the murders were front page news. There was a huge picture of him in the Daily Prophet, from his Cannons days - broad, sunny face, robes billowing. No scars. A smaller picture of Marlene which must have been taken for work, because she was in her uniform.\nPromising young Healer, Mylene McKinnon\naccording to the misspelt caption.\nYasmin was not mentioned at all, though Sirius told Remus they were found lying beside each other, and their fingers were still touching.\n\u201cRemember in third year,\u201d Sirius said, in the days that followed, \u201cWe all thought you two fancied each other.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus replied, monotone.\n\u201cShe was a better beater than me. Wish I\u2019d told her.\u201d\n\u201cShe knew.\u201d Remus said, with a sad smirk.\nMary was not heard from for a long while. Marlene\u2019s death hit her harder than anyone - they had been practically inseparable since they were eleven. Remus remembered how annoying he used to find them, before he figured out that girls were just people too.\nHe remembered her quiet patience, her bouts of fiery passion. The petition to remove the Whomping Willow when she was just thirteen, because someone had been hurt, and Marlene could never stand to see anyone hurt, not if there was something she could do about it. If any one of them had it in them to change the world, it had been her. But no more.\n* * *\nAnother September rolled around, and as always, Remus was reminded of his childhood, and Hogwarts. The scent of parchment, new ink, leather book bags and sealing wax. A sense of fresh beginnings; of change. How can it have been a full decade since he first arrived at King\u2019s Cross, scrawny and angry and neglected?\nSo much had changed since then. He had become a man. He had learnt more than he ever thought possible, achieved things he had never dreamed of - his horizons had been expanded again and again, by education, and magic, and friendship, and love. He wasn\u2019t completely different, of course. Remus didn\u2019t kid himself; his temper hadn\u2019t really gone anywhere, nor had his proclivity to repress bad feelings, only to lash out when things got too much.\nBut he thought he\u2019d been doing\nbetter\n, at least with the people he loved. At least with Sirius. He had opened up and revealed more of himself to Sirius than to anyone else. He had shared feelings which every instinct told him to keep hidden. It hadn\u2019t always been easy - they had fought, they had shouted, they had cried. But it had been\nworth\nit.\nAt least, Remus thought it had.\nHe wasn\u2019t so sure about Sirius. Maybe it was the toll of the war - too many deaths, too many near misses. Maybe it was the separation from James. Maybe Remus had just tested his patience one too many times. He couldn\u2019t put his finger on it. All Remus knew was that something was very, very wrong.\nIt was mid-September by the time he really realised it had happened. Sirius had slipped away from him. They were often apart - Remus had come to see this as a fact of life; their skills were so different, they had different jobs to do. It was nothing, in service of the war. They were glad to do it, and proud to do it.\nBut after some weeks, Remus came to see that this distance was something else,\nmore\nthan just the usual stress. Sirius had pulled back.\n\u201cMiss you.\u201d Remus said, one night. It had taken all day to raise the courage for those two stupid words.\n\u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d Sirius smiled tiredly, sitting across the table, picking at dinner with his fork.\nThen, after a while, he spoke again; \u201cIt\u2019ll all be over soon. We have to trust Dumbledore, that's all.\u201d\nRemus could have wept.\n\u201cBut\nyou\u2019re\nthe only one I trust.\u201d\nSirius just looked at him, sadly. Remus couldn\u2019t bear that look, it made him feel stupid for being in love. Stupid for caring about anything other than winning the war.\nFinally Sirius got up. He picked up his plate and dumped the contents in the bin.\n\u201cGot to go.\u201d He said. \u201cMoody wants me to check in. Be back late, don\u2019t stay up waiting.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t kiss him goodbye.\nRemus was at a loss. Once again, he found himself with a problem that was almost unspeakable. He couldn\u2019t ask James or Lily - even if he knew how to reach them, they had plenty to worry about on their own. Peter had never been very keen to hear about anything to do with Remus and Sirius\u2019s relationship, and though he was a good mate - one of Remus\u2019s\nbest\nmates - they didn\u2019t really confide in each other like that. Marlene might have helped, but Remus didn\u2019t want to think about it. And of course, Mary\u2019s grief didn\u2019t leave much room for romantic advice.\nDeep down, Remus knew that he ought to ask Sirius outright. Except.\nExcept he was terrified of the answer. He was terrified that it wasn\u2019t about the war, or James or growing up. He was terrified that the problem was him. What if Sirius had just fallen out of love?\nThis anxiety worried away at Remus as the nights drew in and the days turned colder. It all seemed to make a horrible kind of sense; the distance, the unwillingness to talk, the lack of affection, their non-existent sex life. And that look. The look Sirius kept levelling at him - as if Remus was a stranger.\nIt was intolerable. Remus didn\u2019t know if he could cope with another loss.\nSo, in early October, when Moody had an assignment for him, Remus was hopeful. Mad-eye took him aside at the end of an Order meeting,\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had eyes on the pack.\u201d he grunted.\n\u201cGreyback?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t think so. The insurgents, we reckon. They\u2019re hiding out in a forest in Germany.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Remus said, surprised. Was it Castor? \u201cHave they attacked someone?\u201d\n\u201cNo, been keeping their heads down, by the looks of things.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Remus said, \u201cWe ought to just leave them alone.\u201d\n\u201cTrust me, lad, I\u2019d prefer to,\u201d Moody replied, with a wry smile, \u201cBut desperate times call for desperate measures. We\u2019re sending you out.\u201d\n\u201cTo do what? They left Greyback - they left Voldemort. Wasn\u2019t that the plan?\u201d\n\u201cIt was. Two years ago. We\u2019ve lost a lot of good people since then. Notice how cosy these meetings are getting?\u201d\nIt was true. The first Order meeting Remus had attended had been overwhelming - the room was packed with witches and wizards ready to fight; to take on the death eaters. Now there were too many missing faces - the McKinnons and the Potters, the Prewetts, old Darius Barebones, Dorcas, Caradoc Dearborn, Benjy Fenwick, Ferox\u2026\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Remus thought hard, \u201cNow you want to recruit the werewolves?\u201d\n\u201cBingo.\u201d\n\u201cAfter years of legislating against them? After forcing them out of jobs? Out of their\nhomes\n?!\u201d Remus knew he was being rude - no one spoke to Alastor Moody like that - but he was too tired, too battle-weary to care.\nMoody didn\u2019t seem fazed. Remus supposed he got a lot worse abuse from much scarier wizards.\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s a bit of a big ask. But as I said, desperate times.\u201d\n\u201cAnd is there anything I can offer them in return for, y\u2019know, their lives?!\u201d\n\u201cVoldemort\u2019s worse.\u201d Moody returned, \u201cWhatever their lives are now, Voldemort will only make them worse.\u201d\nRemus sighed heavily. \u201cFine.\u201d\nHe was ready to go, anyway. He was ready for a change; ready to get out of London, out of his miserable life and back to being useful. He even entertained the idea that a long absence might help the Sirius situation. Didn\u2019t absence make the heart grow fonder?\nIt might be a relief; some breathing space, some time to think. He tested this theory, in his last conversation with Sirius.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be glad to have a few weeks off, eh?\u201d He smiled - which took every bit of his strength.\n\u201cHm?\u201d Sirius frowned, looking up from some blueprints he\u2019d been scanning. He looked annoyed at the interruption, and Remus felt a horrible tearing inside his chest. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\n\u201cI said you\u2019ll be glad to be rid of me, for a bit.\u201d Remus continued, bravely. \u201cHave me out of the way.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would you say it like that?\u201d Sirius stared at him, blankly.\n\u201cLike what? I just meant\u2026 you know, you can have some time to think.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no time to think, not until the war\u2019s over.\u201d Sirius snapped, returning to his blueprints, \u201cIt\u2019ll be the same whether you\u2019re here or not.\u201d\nThat was all Remus could take. He picked up his wand and a packet of cigarettes and left for Germany with only the briefest of goodbyes - as if he was only popping to the shops. He fumed, as he walked to the portkey location. That prick! Give him two weeks on his own, then he\u2019d see; then he\u2019d realise what a dickhead he was being.\nRemus would come back, fresh and wild from the forests, and Sirius would be so sorry, so affectionate, and there would be time to talk and mend, and fall in love again.\nThat was all they needed; a bit more time.\n* * *\nTuesday, 13 October 1981\nRemus was right, too. At least for himself, he did feel much better once he\u2019d left the country. It was so much easier not to think about Sirius - or anything at all in the wizarding world - while he was hidden away in the velvety depths of the Black Forest.\nHe chose to arrive the afternoon before the full moon - best to approach the pack as a wolf.\nThe transformation was quick - the woods around him were teaming with life and ancient magic, amplifying the razor sharp power of the full moon. The night itself was as familiar and terrifying as his wolf pelt. The pack found him, close to dawn. They welcomed him home with glee, and gathered around, throwing back their necks to howl gorgeously up at the night sky, until the stars rang with their singing.\nAs they all returned to human form, Remus writhed back into life amongst a scrum of other bodies, and Castor\u2019s hands on him, already healing his wounds.\n\u201cIt is good to see you, Remus Lupin.\u201d\nThey all walked slowly through the trees as the butter yellow October light filtered down onto the leaf litter.\nIn the time the pack had been living there, they had constructed a small village of wattle huts to live in. They all curled up to sleep on soft dry moss with birdsong trilling overhead.\nRemus woke up without knots in his shoulders, and without his jaw clenched. He was relaxed for the first time in months. Castor lay beside him, so warm, and so peaceful, his soft brown skin pressing against Remus\u2019s in places. Remembering his humanity, Remus pulled away, slightly. Castor\u2019s eyes opened, and peered into his.\n\u201cAre you well, Remus Lupin?\u201d\n\u201cYes, fine thanks.\u201d He rubbed his eyes. Castor kept watching him.\n\u201cYou are suffering.\u201d He said. A statement, not a question.\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost some people.\u201d Remus said, \u201cWe\u2019re losing the war.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Castor agreed. \u201cAnd you have come to ask for our help, is that not so, Remus Lupin?\u201d\n\u201cI know it's not a small thing\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe will stay here. This is our home.\u201d\n\u201cYou understand I wouldn\u2019t ask unless the situation was desperate. You understand\u2026 Voldemort won\u2019t spare werewolves, either?\u201d\n\u201cWe do.\u201d Castor said, simply. \u201cAnd we are agreed. We will stay here. We will hide - we are good at it.\u201d\n\u201cI found you.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Remus Lupin. You will always be welcome.\u201d\nRemus sat up, and reached for the wolfskin cloak at his feet, covering himself with it.\n\u201cWell that's that, then.\u201d He said. \u201cI\u2019d better get back.\u201d\nCastor reached up and placed a hand on his arm.\n\u201cStay a while, Remus Lupin. We have so much to show you. Perhaps then you will see.\u201d\nSo Remus stayed. He thought that if he spent a bit of time with them, as before, he might be able to talk to them, change somebody\u2019s mind. Most of them had wizarding family back in the UK, he had to be able to appeal to them, surely.\nHe couldn\u2019t go back to the Order without trying - everyone else was giving their whole selves to the fight, and this was, after all, his purpose. If he couldn\u2019t be a decent emissary to the werewolves, then what good was he at all?\nStill, it wasn\u2019t a difficult decision to make. It was no great sacrifice. He had nothing to go back to except a very difficult conversation with Sirius.\nAnd he\ndid\ntalk to them. Over the three weeks Remus spent with the werewolves in October 1981, he spoke to each and every one of them. He reasoned, he sermonised, he ranted. But it was no use at all; they were all happy. Not in a mad, deluded \u2018everything is perfect\u2019 way, as some of the Greyback followers had been. But in a practical, empowered way - they saw a future for themselves, they saw a way to live a life free from cruelty or intervention. It wasn\u2019t for everyone - it definitely wasn\u2019t for Remus - but he couldn\u2019t deny they were making it work.\nIn fact, as time went on, Remus lost track of who was doing the persuading. Everyone was so keen to take him hunting, to show him how to weave wood, or cast protective spells which made them almost invisible to humans. He was never hungry, or cold, or in fear for his life.\n\u201cDo you see now?\u201d Castor asked one evening, as Halloween approached.\n\u201cYes, I see.\u201d Remus replied, staring up at the thatched ceiling. \u201cYou\u2019d all rather hide, like cowards.\u201d\n\u201cYou do not believe that, Remus Lupin.\u201d Castor smirked, settling down to sleep. He occasionally demonstrated actual emotion, now that he and Remus were so close.\nRemus had elected to keep sharing a hut with him. He didn\u2019t like sleeping alone, and it wasn\u2019t as if anything was\ngoing on\n, it just made sense. He had to stay close to the leader, it was what anyone would do. And yes, it was an intense relationship, but that simply\ndidn\u2019t mean\nit was anything to do with sex. That was simply how things were, with the werewolves, everything was motivated by scent and instinct and the phases of the moon.\nStill, Remus knew how it would look. He didn\u2019t kid himself that Sirius was going to suddenly have a change of heart and come racing desperately to Germany to find him, but Remus knew that it was pretty wrong, even without a chance of getting caught. It was pathetic, too. He scolded himself about it, through the long dark nights;\nyou\u2019re a ridiculous excuse for a man. A few weeks feeling ignored and you\u2019re cosying up to the next good looking bloke who shows you any interest. And you haven\u2019t even got the balls to do anything about it.\nIn the end it was his desire for Castor that told him he needed to leave. And his love for Sirius. Remus had done some very drastic and very stupid things in his life, but he was not going to run away to live in a forest just to escape talking to the love of his life. He would go home, and he would force himself to confront it. He would do everything he could to keep Sirius, because deep down, he knew that it was the only thing that really mattered.\n\n* * *\n\n2nd November 1981\nThe portkey had closed, and Remus couldn\u2019t get in touch with anyone. He had to get himself back to Britain alone, apparating part of the way, hitching lifts the rest.\nBy the time Remus had staggered his way into London, he hadn\u2019t even the energy to apparate. He got a bus instead, and fell asleep half the way to Leicester Square. He got off and stopped at his usual corner shop for a pouch of tobacco. He bought two Mars bars as well - if Sirius was in, he could have one. If not then tough luck, Remus would scoff them both.\nAs he unlocked his front door, he could hear the phone ringing. It took him a few moments to get in - the wooden frame had swollen with all the rainfall, and the door got gummed up sometimes - but when he got in, it was still ringing.\nMust be urgent\n, he thought, absent-mindedly.\nHe shouted, \u201cPadfoot? You in?\u201d as he crossed the the room, then lifted the receiver, \u201cHello?\u201d\n\u201cHello? Hello, Remus, is that you?\u201d\n\u201cMary? Hi! I just got back - where the hell is everybody?!\u201d\nThere was a strange silence on the end of the phone, and a horrible static prickle ran down his spine. \u201cMary?!\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJesus Christ, Mary, what?!\u201d\n\u201cRemus\u2026 something awful has happened.\u201d\nShe started explaining, and Remus fell to his knees as the whole world began to fall apart."

Remus ought to have expected that. He would have been waiting right at the front door; it would never even cross his mind to hide, or run.\n\n\nThen Lily, standing in front of her son. Remus pictured her defiant face, her hands gripping the sides of the cot, her green eyes blazing. She would have met death with her eyes wide open, that was certain.\n\n\nAnd then Peter, next. Oh Peter, the idiot - the brave, ridiculous idiot. He must have heard about James and Lily, he must have known\n\n\nat once\n\n\nwho was to blame. After all those years in James and Sirius\u2019s shadow, Peter\u2019s first instinct had been to face Black himself.\n\n\nHe\u2019d inadvertently led Aurors right to Sirius, so his brutal death hadn\u2019t been completely in vain.\n\n\n\nRight to Sirius.\n\n\n\nAnd there was the block. Like a curtain falling across the scene, Remus\u2019s mind wouldn\u2019t touch Sirius. He couldn\u2019t get there; couldn\u2019t picture any of it. He supposed that was his brain\u2019s way of protecting him. It hurt enough just knowing the bare facts.\n\n\nMary came over as soon as she\u2019d hung up the phone. She was the only person he could have tolerated, anyway, and god; she was so strong. He lay his head in her lap, and she stroked his hair like a mother.\n\n\n\u201cSirius,\u201d he wept, over and over, clinging to her skirt, \u201cSirius!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered back, tears streaming down her cheeks, dripping into his hair. \u201cI know, I know...\u201d\n\n\nShe\u2019d brought a sleeping draught with her, and Remus drank it all down greedily, eager for escape. While he slept, Mary packed up all of Sirius\u2019s things. All of his clothes, his records, his books. When Remus got up, the flat seemed almost empty.\n\n\n\u201cI had Darren move them down to the garage,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to touch any of it until you\u2019re ready. The bike\u2019s gone, I don\u2019t know where.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe must have taken it.\u201d Remus said, feeling numb. He was already wondering how much alcohol he had in the flat, and whether or not he ought to wait for Mary to leave before he started working his way through it.\n\n\n\u201cRemus\u2026 I have to go, now.\u201d She said, gently, standing up, hugging herself. She looked small. Mary had always been a larger than life sort of girl, but Remus realised that she could barely be 5\u20195.\n\n\n\u201cYes, of course.\u201d He murmured. There was definitely some gin under the sink in the kitchen.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be gone for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going\u2026 Darren\u2019s taking me to Jamaica, to stay with family. I need some time away, I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be back.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d He looked her in the eye, properly. She wasn\u2019t wearing any makeup - he hadn\u2019t seen Mary without eyeliner and lipstick since she was twelve.\n\n\n\u201cIs there\u2026 can someone stop by, to see you? I don\u2019t mind making a phone call for you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut I will.\u201d She said, smiling half-heartedly. \u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t contact anyone?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one.\u201d He said.\n\n\nI\u2019ve got no one.\n\n\n\n\u201cPerhaps speak to Moody? Or Arthur?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, good idea.\u201d Remus nodded. He didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone, but he didn\u2019t want her to worry. \u201cDo you know\u2026 What are we supposed to do, now?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHave you spoken to Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHa.\u201d Mary snorted, \u201cGood luck getting hold of him. Too busy being congratulated by the ministry. He\u2019ll probably be at the\u2026 the memorial service.\u201d\n\n\nRemus felt as if an ice cold blade was twisting in his gut. This couldn\u2019t be real.\n\n\n\u201cWhy us.\u201d He said, looking up at her, desperate for answers, \u201cOut of everyone. Why is it you and me left, and not Lily and James? Who decided that?! It\u2019s bollocks!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know, sweetheart.\u201d She said, softly. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\nHe couldn\u2019t wait any longer, he went to the kitchen and grabbed the nearest open bottle from the cupboard. Gin, leftover from some party or other. He didn\u2019t pour a glass, just drank.\n\n\n\u201cRemus,\u201d Mary said, chewing her lip, watching him from the living room, \u201cI really do have to go\u2026 do you promise you\u2019ll get in touch with Arthur?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He nodded. He just wanted her to leave, now. \u201cSee ya.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGoodbye, love. I\u2019ll be back, I promise.\u201d\n\n\nAnd she left. And Remus was alone.\n\n\n* * *"

If anything, it was getting worse.\n\n\nRemus opened his eyes. His throat was dry and his head hurt. Actually, everything hurt; he\u2019d been sleeping on the couch for weeks. Or months? Who cared. It was uncomfortable, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to enter the bedroom. Most nights he was too drunk to move anyway. Most days he was too drunk. He didn\u2019t have hangovers anymore, just breaks between bottles. The kid next door didn\u2019t mind running down to the off licence every other day for him, he was probably making a killing in spare change.\n\n\nThe banging continued.\n\n\n\u201cRemus?!\u201d The muffled sound came through the door, and whoever was on the other side kept hammering away,\n\n\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d he shouted, his throat raw as sandpaper.\n\n\nHe reached for the nearest bottle on the floor beneath him and swigged from it. He nearly choked on the burning whisky, but managed to get most of it down, thank god. He couldn\u2019t afford to waste one drop of oblivion.\n\n\n\u201cRemus? Let me in!\u201d\n\n\nIt was Grant. He recognised the voice now - maybe the scent too, but his senses had been a mess, ever since\u2026\n\n\nno, no no no\u2026.\n\n\n\nHe curled up, burying his head in the sofa cushions. He couldn\u2019t talk to anyone. He couldn\u2019t see anyone. He just needed to be left, to drink and to forget.\n\n\nPlease\n\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cFuck off!\u201d He sobbed, yelling at the door, \u201cLeave me alone!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Grant shouted back, and the banging got louder still, a relentless, resounding thud-thud-thud. He was actually trying to break the door down, the stupid prat.\n\n\nRemus half considered just casting a silencing spell. But he wasn\u2019t sure where his wand was. He rolled over again, and got up.\n\n\nThere were bottles and cans all over the floor, and they clinked and rustled as he waded through. His arms and legs felt like lead. What day was it? It was cold. He rubbed his arms as he approached the door, shuddering against the chill. He\u2019d left a window open somewhere in the flat and forgotten to shut it. Oh well.\n\n\nThe door was still being thumped as he reached it, the wood would splinter if he wasn\u2019t careful.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d He yanked the door open.\n\n\nGrant stared at him, fist still raised, wide eyed. His cheeks were pink from shouting, he was breathing heavily. He looked Remus up and down.\n\n\n\u201cJesus christ.\u201d He said, rudely pushing his way in, \u201cWhat happened? I\u2019ve been trying to ring ya for days, what\u2019s wrong with the phone?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOff the hook.\u201d Remus said, slowly returning to his nest on the couch, where at least it was warm. He curled his cold feet under himself and picked up the bottle again.\n\n\n\u201cThe fuck\u2019s been going on here?\u201d Grant looked around at the mess. He looked at Remus again, \u201c...gawd, \u2018e ain\u2019t left you, has \u2018e?\u201d\n\n\nRemus stared up at him, and he couldn\u2019t help it. He began to cry. He leaned forward on his knees, dropping his head into his hands, and he bawled like a child.\n\n\n\u201cShit,\u201d Grant hurried over to sit next to him, not minding the empty cans, the smelly cushions and blankets, \u201cMe and my big mouth! I\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d he pulled Remus to him without a thought, and it must have been awful, because Remus knew he hadn't washed in ages, all he\u2019d done was drink and cry for days and days and days, but Grant held him fast.\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all gone.\u201d Remus said, when he could speak. \u201cI\u2019m alone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBollocks.\u201d Said Grant. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone.\u201d\n\n\nRemus cried even harder.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nNot a single day went by \u2013 and not one day would ever go by, for many years \u2013 that he did not think of Sirius and suffer. It was an abstract and cruel torture, and Remus resigned himself to a life of utter misery.\n\n\nEverywhere he looked he was haunted by thoughts and memories of his friends, of the things they could never do, and the things he had not done in time. He attended the funeral - a joint one for Lily and James, followed by a memorial for Peter. Remus sat at the back, and left before the wake, in case anyone tried to speak to him.\n\n\nHe was terrified that someone might ask him about Sirius - might ask him what he knew. Or tell him something he didn\u2019t want to know. So Remus did not stay to reminisce, or \u2018celebrate\u2019 his friends\u2019 lives, (honestly, what a despicable idea). He went home alone, and got drunk. He got drunk every day for weeks.\n\n\nHe stayed at the flat in Soho \u2013 he had no choice in the matter; no money, no family. No friends.\n\n\nThe Order disbanded and those who still had lives worth living didn\u2019t want to know him. He couldn\u2019t find any work in the wizarding world and \u2013 never having felt at home in it anyway \u2013 chose to withdraw.\n\n\nAfter learning about the fate of the Longbottoms in the Daily Prophet, he stopped reading the papers. He did not re-connect to the floo network, he did not use magic at all unless he really had to. He never went to Diagon Alley, and for all intents and purposes lived as a muggle.\n\n\nMary sent postcards from Jamaica, from Trinidad, from Saint Lucia - she seemed to have family all over the Caribbean. She kept saying sorry. Remus didn\u2019t know what for; they\u2019d both lost the same things. At least she cared enough to get in touch.\n\nDumbledore actually did try to contact him a couple of times, but Remus deliberately made himself difficult to reach.\n\nHe was furious at the old man, who as far as Remus was concerned had never lifted a finger to help. Who had thrust them all into the war, young as they were, and stupid as they were, and who watched them die one by one without so much as blinking. Even the baby, Harry, was quickly tidied away into some anonymous corner of Surrey. The marauders might never have existed at all. Better that they hadn\u2019t.\n\nFor a while, Remus wondered when it would end.\n\n\nAfter long enough, he realised it never would, and so just tried to dull the pain. It might have been selfish, but what else was left but to be selfish? He had sacrificed plenty.\n\n\nWhen the first full moon came, the November after that grisly Halloween, Remus was forced to leave the flat. He apparated back to the forest he\u2019d stayed in with Greyback\u2019s pack, back in \u201879. It was better than a cell. He wouldn\u2019t be locked up, he wouldn\u2019t allow it. So he left, he transformed, and he wandered the woods alone, howling and hunting and snarling. \u00a0The first time was a relief, but the wolf was lonely. The second time, he went to the Black Forest.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t intend to live amongst the werewolves, he just used them as an escape route.\n\n\nThey knew little of the war, except that it was over. The first time, Castor sensed Remus\u2019s pain at once. They didn\u2019t speak of it - because there was no need. They simply transformed and dealt with it as wolves. Remus decided that whatever happened when they were not human didn\u2019t count, as long as they didn\u2019t hurt anyone. It was freeing, and the only relief Remus knew in those darkest months after his loss.\n\n\nIn the mornings after the moon, Remus would stay a little longer each time, just to be near them. With nothing left to lose, he gave up any pretence of superiority when it came to the pack, and in time, Castor finally got what he wanted.\n\n\nRemus couldn\u2019t deny his attraction to Castor much longer, and after all; who did he need to be loyal to? Was he supposed to live celibate for the rest of his life simply because his first love had broken his heart? And there was no love between him and Castor. Only animal need; bestial rutting. It was good, but it was only another way to forget. And Remus always returned to London, sore and still unsatisfied.\n\n\nIn the human world, Grant still came back for regular visits, after that first time. He took the spare key, and popped in to check on Remus between his lectures and pub shifts. He was both a help and a hindrance, bringing bottles of muggle spirits and other substances - whatever Remus asked for.\n\n\nHe\u2019d been kicked out of his bedsit for soliciting (not true, he insisted - the landlady just had it in for him) and now Grant bounced between boyfriends\u2019 beds and friends couches. Sometimes he even stayed with Remus for a night or two, and that was ok, Remus didn\u2019t mind. He didn\u2019t care about very much, as long as he had plenty to drink. He needed to be drunk. Before the war ended, it had just been a way to take the edge off; to change his mood. Now it\n\n\nwas\n\n\nhis mood; the only one he could bear.\n\n\nIt was Grant who talked at him, nagged him, dragged him out of bed and pushed him into the shower when he needed to. He even did the laundry, and bought groceries with Remus\u2019s remaining dwindling funds.\n\n\nRemus, for his part, behaved abysmally. He made spiteful comments, hurled insults. But Grant paid it no mind, and kept returning all the same.\n\n\n\u201cYou only come back because you\u2019re basically homeless.\u201d Remus spat one evening, from the couch, as Grant collected the rubbish littered around him. Remus couldn\u2019t bear the clinking sound empty bottles made.\n\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d Grant replied, blithely, carrying on about his business, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly right, Remus me old pal. Nuffink to do with the fact that I love your dozy arse.\u201d\n\n\nRemus snorted disdainfully. Grant didn\u2019t know what he was talking about.\n\n\nLove!\n\n\nRemus knew the truth now. He knew that love was just something people said to make you weak - to keep you pliant. Never again.\n\n\nNever never never\n\n\n.\n\n\nMiraculously, Grant never once asked what had happened. Even when Remus began to show signs of improvement, started getting himself up and dressed without hours of nudging, even when he started leaving the house. Grant never asked\n\n\nwhy\n\n\n.\n\n\nRemus knew he had ranted, in his drunken stupors, pouring out misery and rage about Sirius and James and Lily and poor, poor Peter, and Sirius and Sirius and\n\n\nSirius\n\n\n...\n\n\nWhether Grant understood half of it, or whether Remus said too much, he never knew. But Grant kept coming back, anyway.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep coming, long as you need me.\u201d He\u2019d say, cheerfully as he flitted about. \u201cUs care home yobs gotta stick together, innit.\u201d\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t believe him. Grant was being nice, but that could only last so long. Nobody stayed around forever."

            "content": "These people 'round here\n\n\n\n\nWear beat down eyes sunk in smoke dried faces\n\n\n\n\nThey're resigned to what their fate is.\n\n\n\n\nBut not us, (no never) no not us (no never)\n\n\n\n\nWe are far too young and clever.\n\n\n\n\n6th June 1983\n\n\n\u201cSometimes I wonder if you\u2019re using me.\u201d Grant said, one afternoon in the summer of 1983.\n\n\n\u201cWe all use each other.\u201d Remus replied, dryly, \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we think love is.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cChrist. Can\u2019t talk to you when you\u2019re like this.\u201d Grant sighed heavily, reaching for a packet of cigarettes on the bedside table.\n\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA gloomy git.\u201d\n\n\nGrant pulled a long white cylinder from the box with his teeth, and Remus lit it with his wand point. Grant sucked on it appreciatively, settling back against Remus\u2019s body, in the crook of his arm. Remus lazily stroked Grant\u2019s collar bone until it was his turn to smoke. They\u2019d almost given up; sharing a quick post-sex fag was their treat.\n\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Remus said, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be gloomy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPfft.\u201d Grant replied, cheerfully, \u201cBe gloomy if you want, I\u2019m only teasin' ya. \u201d\n\n\nGrant made everything so easy. Remus could barely remember when their relationship had grown into what it was now.\n\n\n...\n\n\nIt had started with the regular visits, after that first intervention. They\u2019d grown more frequent, and eventually Grant was just there all the time - first he slept on the couch, and then he didn\u2019t anymore, and it was never discussed again.\n\n\nBy midsummer 1982, he\u2019d moved all of his belongings in - such that they were.\n\n\n\u201cI travel light,\u201d he winked, shaking out a rucksack that contained a few clean pairs of underwear and some t-shirts.\n\n\nOne sock. For god\u2019s sake.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you some money.\u201d Remus said, monotonously. \u201cYou can go shopping.\u201d He still had a few hundred pounds Sirius had converted to muggle money in case of emergencies. Remus didn\u2019t feel guilty about spending it; it was just sitting there.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to scrounge off you.\u201d Grant insisted.\n\n\n\u201cI know. But you need clothes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes mum. I\u2019ll borrow some of yours for a bit, \u2018til I get myself sorted.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\n\nSo Remus went to Debenhams by himself one afternoon and bought as much as he could in Grant\u2019s size. Jeans and t-shirts and underwear and socks and jumpers, pyjamas and even a cheap pair of trainers that were on offer. Bright colours, because Grant was a bright person, and Remus had seen enough black to last a lifetime. He folded it all away in the chest of drawers. It felt good to fill them; they\u2019d been standing half-empty for over a year.\n\n\nGrant wore the clothes, but they never discussed it.\n\n\nThere were some things they could not avoid talking about, though.\n\n\nRemus hadn\u2019t been doing magic at all for the first few months - actually, he found that he couldn\u2019t, a lot of the time; even when he tried. Perhaps the grief. All those funerals. It may have had more to do with his drinking, though he couldn\u2019t be sure. There was a block there; like a wall had gone up. He could apparate for full moons, but that was the extent of it. Then one day, it just came back, as if it had never left him.\n\n\nThey\u2019d forgotten to pay the electric, and the lights went dead. Without thinking, Remus lit his wand,\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nLumos\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat the bloody fuck is that?!\u201d Grant leapt away as if Remus had set himself on fire.\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Remus swallowed, then resigned himself to it. \u201cIt\u2019s a magic wand.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you high?\u201d\n\n\nRemus laughed, a gruff, alien sound.\n\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019d better explain some stuff to you. The school I went to was a bit\u2026 different\u2026\u201d\n\n\nHe began to explain. He knew how weird it must all sound, and he had to leave quite a lot of stuff out. Almost twenty minutes later, Grant sat staring at him, face pale in the weakening wandlight.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re having me on.\u201d He laughed, nervously, \u201cWhat are you playing at, making up a load of tosh like that?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGrant\u2026 look...\u201d Remus made sparks with his wand. He levitated the coffee table, and then - showing off, because it had been so long - transformed his mug into a frog.\n\n\n\u201cAll right!\u201d Grant recoiled, as the frog hopped onto the carpet, \u201cOk, I believe you! Jesus Christ!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, just \u2018Remus Lupin\u2019 will do.\u201d Remus stuck his tongue out.\n\n\nThen he stopped, realised what he was doing.\n\n\nHe\u2019d stopped hurting for a moment, and chastised himself viciously for it.\n\n\nYour friends are dead, and you\u2019re doing magic tricks for some muggle? Pathetic.\n\n\n\nHe went to look in the cupboards for a drink.\n\n\n\u201cOh no, don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Grant said, sounding disappointed.\n\n\nRemus returned to the couch with a bottle of vodka and two tumblers. He liked vodka the most, it went down easy.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want any.\u201d Grant said, ignoring the second glass. \u201cI\u2019m going to stop getting it for you.\u201d\n\n\nRemus shrugged and knocked back his first measure.\n\n\nGrant sighed. \u201cSo you\u2019re a wizard, eh? Does that mean\u2026 Sirius was a wizard, too?\u201d\n\n\nRemus nearly choked on his second shot, but got it down. His eyes watered and he nodded.\n\n\n\u201cYeah. We all are. Were.\u201d\n\n\nAnd he drank more, and told Grant about the war. He left out some of the more painful details, but Grant was astute, and guessed the rest.\n\n\n\u201cIs that where you vanish off to, every month?\u201d Grant asked, \u201cSome magic thing?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 no. There\u2019s something else.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBloody hell, Remus, do I know\n\n\nanything\n\n\nabout you?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Remus said. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m really not worth the effort\u2026 once you know everything, you\u2019ll understand.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTry me.\u201d Grant said.\n\n\nSo then they had the werewolf conversation. Remus explained what happened to him on full moons, and how dangerous he was, and where he went.\n\n\n\u201cSince you were five?!\u201d Grant said, aghast.\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus nodded, nervously.\n\n\n\u201cYou poor thing,\u201d Grant shook his head, and stroked his hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a rough go of it, \u2018aven\u2019t ya?\u201d\n\n\nRemus accepted the sympathy, and didn\u2019t say too much about Castor, because he was ashamed of himself.\n\n\nNot that Grant would have been jealous.\n\n\nNot like Sirius, not like\u2026 oh, oh no, no no no...\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\u201cOi!\u201d\n\n\nBack in the present, Grant snapped his fingers. He held up the cigarette, half smoked. \u201cYour turn, gorgeous.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Remus took it, and inhaled deeply. Ah. They were still in bed. Everything was ok.\n\n\nEverything is ok.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou drifted away from me, there.\u201d Grant commented, without accusation.\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Remus said again.\n\n\n\u201cPenny for \u2018em?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, nothing. Just thinking.\u201d He stubbed out the cigarette. Fucking hell he missed smoking.\n\n\n\u201cWell.\u201d Grant rolled over, lying half on top of Remus, face centimetres away, \u201c\n\n\nThat\u2019s\n\n\nno good, is it? I was trying to\n\n\nstop\n\n\nyou from thinking.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou do.\u201d Remus smiled. They kissed, friendly at first, then deeper. Remus slid his hands up Grant\u2019s long body. \u201cWant to try again?\u201d\n\n\nGrant smiled against his lips, \u00a0murmuring,\n\n\n\u201cYou just want another fag, doncha?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI want\n\n\nyou\n\n\n, too\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, tough luck,\u201d Grant pulled away, pushing himself off Remus, off the bed. \u201cLast shift at the pub starts in forty minutes, already gonna have to leg it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you have to?\u201d Remus flopped back on the bed, petulant.\n\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t whinge, princess, it's only one more evening. Oi, be good and stay off the booze and I\u2019ll do something\n\n\nreally nice\n\n\nwhen I get in.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be asleep.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll wake you up.\u201d\n\n\nRemus smirked. \u201cOk then.\u201d\n\n\nGrant made everything so easy.\n\n\nHe tried to stay off the drink that night, he really did. But he needed\n\n\nsomething\n\n\n, or else how would he ever sleep? And he definitely didn\u2019t smoke, so that was pretty good. He wanted to be good, for Grant\u2019s last night at the pub.\n\n\nAfter getting three A-levels in Social Policy, Politics and Education, then studying for months for further exams, Grant had qualified as a social worker. He was beginning a placement at a boys remand centre the following week. Remus didn\u2019t know where he got the balls for it.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be like doing St Edmunds all over again!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo it won\u2019t,\u201d Grant smiled, \u201cIt\u2019ll be different, because I\u2019ll make it different.\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThey were pretty happy together. They had their moments, anyway, but they were always friends before lovers and neither of them were faithful.\n\n\nGrant had plenty of other boyfriends in his never ending quest for variety. They might be arty types, with long hair and camp affectations. Or earnest, political sorts, in baggy khaki fatigues and thick knitted jumpers, campaigning for nuclear disarmament or gay and lesbian rights, or the miners or something. Remus watched them come and go with a distant interest. He didn\u2019t begrudge Grant \u2013 he knew he was hardly a barrel of laughs to be with.\n\n\nRemus himself had become excellent at dividing his life up into neat segments with razor sharp edges. Castor was a bad habit; Grant was everything else. Then there was Sirius\u2019s spectre, looming over the whole thing, making sure he was never really happy with either of them.\n\n\n\u201cYou could stay, brother,\u201d Castor said, every time.\n\n\n\u201cCan you not call me \u2018brother\u2019\n\n\nright\n\n\nafter you\u2019ve been fucking me?\u201d Remus snapped. He was often rude to Castor, and Castor was rough with him right back. Remus wasn\u2019t sure if it was a wolf thing or a self-punishment thing, but he tried not to analyse the arrangement too much.\n\n\n\u201cRemus Lupin, then.\u201d Castor replied.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\n\n\nRemus\n\n\n.\u201d He grunted, getting up to dress himself. \u201cAnd you know I can\u2019t stay. I\u2019ve got a life back in England.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou say that,\u201d Castor raised an eyebrow, \u201cBut I see no evidence. We would care for you here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust any of you as far as I could throw you.\u201d Remus said flatly, buttoning up his jeans.\n\n\n\u201cAnd yet you return each month\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s just for this,\u201d Remus gestured at Castor\u2019s naked body, reclining back on grey furs - he was absolutely perfect in every way, a greek statue, lithe and muscular and delicious. \u201cLet\u2019s not start pretending we like each other.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut we are your pack!\u201d Castor protested.\n\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019ll stop coming at all, if you don\u2019t leave off.\u201d Remus gritted his teeth. He did stop going, for two months after that, just to make Castor suffer.\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t need a pack, and he\n\n\ncertainly\n\n\ndidn\u2019t need friends.\n\n\nSometimes Mary tried to get in touch, sometimes he let her. But it was hard, so very hard. He preferred Grant, and their modest muggleish life together.\n\n\nAnd really, though their life was not one Remus had ever imagined living, it was hardly empty. Remus took up various odd jobs - cleaning, mostly; or courier work, because it was cash-in-hand no one cared if he stopped showing up.\n\n\nGrant studied for his licence and always had students around, debating in the living room, preparing for another protest against Poll Tax or for nuclear disarmament. They made a huge mess of the living room painting banners and nailing together placards, but Remus didn\u2019t mind a bit of chaos.\n\n\nHe liked the girls Grant invited over better than he liked the boys - they were all so vibrant, so passionate, with punky green hair and boyish, mischievous attitudes. He didn't care much for the causes, but the conversation was always lively. At times he felt he was speaking to Mary, or Marlene, or Lily. Then he would slow down, and he\u2019d need a drink. He would stand quietly in the kitchen until they all left.\n\n\n\u201cOh, Remus. You can\u2019t just wander off and get pissed every time you\u2019re sad.\u201d Grant sighed one night, when he found Remus slumped over the kitchen table, hours after everyone had left.\n\n\n\u201cI\n\n\nam\n\n\nsad.\u201d Remus sobbed.\n\n\n\u201cI know you are mate,\u201d Grant bent down and pulled Remus\u2019s arm over his shoulder, hoisting him up towards bed. \u201cAnd you\u2019re allowed to be sad. It's the drink we\u2019ve got the problem with, eh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo one owes you a happy life.\" Remus mournfully parroted Matron\u2019s old adage as they swayed down the hall together.\n\n\n\"No,\" Grant huffed, setting him into bed. He looked down at Remus pityingly, \"But you owe yourself one, love.\u201d"

His smile, his corkscrew blond curls, his brash, unapologetic sense of humour. Grant was a likeable person. But there was one thing Remus absolutely refused to tolerate.\nGrant loved football. He wasn\u2019t a fanatic, but he definitely had more of an interest than Remus really felt was necessary. He supported Queens Park Rangers - and even bought himself a knock-off kit t-shirt one year, plus the blue and white striped scarf. Never one to simply observe, Grant was an occasional gambler too, and on Saturdays he played on a gay men\u2019s team away down in South London.\nThat was how he met Neil Newman - a tall, good looking football player with spiky hair and thighs you could crack walnuts on - and how Remus met Anthea Luong; Neil\u2019s part-time girlfriend.\n\u201cPart-time?!\u201d Remus raised an eyebrow when Grant explained. He was tying up his boot laces, ready to go for practice one Saturday and Neil was coming to pick him up.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that unusual,\u201d Grant winked at him, Remus took the point.\n\u201cBut if Neil\u2019s\nqueer\n--\u201d Remus tried. Grant lifted a finger,\n\u201cGet with the times, sunshine - queer\u2019s out. We are Gay Men, and we are proud.\u201d\nRemus rolled his eyes, \u201cWhatever. If Neil\u2019s\na Gay Man\n, then how does Anthea fit in?\u201d\n\u201cI reckon he must be bicentennial.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean bisexual.\u201d Remus corrected.\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s two hundred years old,\u201d Grant poked his tongue out. \u201cYes, Mr Literal,\nbisexual\n.\u201d\nRemus couldn\u2019t really blame Neil for that, once he\u2019d met her too. Anthea was a very attractive girl. She was tiny and springy, with long satin black hair and glittering eyes. Her mouth was like a rosebud, and she had the most beautiful skin Remus had ever seen. She dressed like Cindy Lauper, all frills and dayglo.\n\u201c\nSo\nnice to meet you,\u201d she grinned, stretching up on her tiptoes to kiss Remus\u2019s cheek in greeting. Neil just gave him a slightly wary nod - Remus was used to that, from Grant\u2019s paramours.\n\u201cTea, everybody?\u201d Grant offered.\n\u201cNah, we\u2019d better get going.\u201d Neil said, rather pointedly, Remus thought. \u201cWant to get there early, don\u2019t we? Warm up.\u201d\n\u201cIs that what you call it?\u201d Anthea stuck her tongue out at him. \u201cRemus, can I stay here with you? I\u2019ve got\nso much\nI want to talk to you about.\u201d\n\u201cYou have?!\u201d He stared at her, alarmed. He hadn\u2019t even known Neil had a girlfriend until ten minutes ago.\n\u201cOh yeah, I told Anth here how good you are at astrology.\u201d Grant said cheerfully, pulling his denim jacket on. It looked silly, in shorts and long socks, but everything football related was ridiculous to Remus.\n\u201cAstro\nnomy\n.\u201d Remus said, \u201cVery different things\u2026\u201d\n\u201cS\u2019all stars and that, innit?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d he didn\u2019t really have an argument.\n\u201cSee you lads! Have fun!\u201d Anthea waved at them both, pushing them out of the door. Suddenly Remus was alone with a strange young woman, with no idea why. He really wanted a drink.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a TV.\u201d She said, flatly.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus agreed.\n\u201cGreat flat, though!\u201d She was saying, walking around the room, looking out of the window, pulling books off the shelf and scanning the covers, \u201cSo nice you live in Chinatown - do you speak chinese?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 no\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cI do, I speak three languages, actually, Chinese, Vietnamese and English. English is my mother tongue, Vietnamese is my mother\u2019s tongue, if you get me.\u201d she winked at him, \u201cAnd\nNeil\nalways says I ought to say I speak four languages, because I chat so much shit.\u201d She laughed - it was a bit of an ugly, jangly laugh, like coins falling on sheet metal, but she laughed with such conviction that it was endearing anyway.\n\u201cRight.\u201d Remus nodded. \u201cEr\u2026 sorry, did you want to know something about astronomy?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. I\u2019m a Virgo, what are you?\u201d\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Pisces, I think?\u201d\n\u201cDo they go together?\u201d She asked. He blinked,\n\u201cNo. I mean, I don\u2019t know. I mean\u2026 like I said, that\u2019s really astrology, not--\u201d\n\u201cNeil\u2019s a capricorn, and they\ndon\u2019t\ngo with virgos, I checked. I always check. But, y\u2019know, the heart wants what it wants. You know they\u2019re shagging?\u201d she said, out of nowhere, \u201cHim and Grant?\u201d\n\u201cI guessed\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDo you mind it? You\u2019re Grant\u2019s live in, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nRemus nodded, though he privately corrected her - Grant was\nhis\nlive in, not the other way around. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty casual, though.\u201d\n\u201cOh that\u2019s good,\u201d she nodded, earnestly.\n\u201cLook, um\u2026 how long are you staying?\u201d Remus scratched his head awkwardly.\n\u201cJust til the boys get back from footie,\u201d she smiled, \u201cThat's ok, isn\u2019t it? Grant said you\u2019d like the company. Ooh, I tell you what, I\u2019d love a cup of tea.\u201d\n\u201cUm. Ok\u2026\u201d He went to put the kettle on, still confused. What was Grant playing at, leaving him to babysit his lover\u2019s girlfriend?! As if Remus had nothing better to do on a Saturday. He\u2019d planned to read the paper. Maybe catch up with the Archers on the radio.\n\u201cNo sugar, no milk!\u201d Anthea called. \u201cOooh, can I put a record on?\u201d\n\u201cIf you like\u2026\u201d\nShe put on a Queen album. Remus sighed to himself. He wasn\u2019t a fan, really, but Grant couldn\u2019t get enough.\nWhen he brought the tea through, Anthea was sitting on the couch, leaning over the coffee table rolling a joint. She grinned at him, \u201cFancy it?\u201d\n\u201cGo on then,\u201d Remus agreed. Well, that was better than nothing.\nThey smoked and drank tea and listened to Queen, and Anthea rabbited on, asking all sorts.\n\u201cGrant says you're really clever, private school and everything.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Remus shrugged.\n\u201cAnd you know all about constellations, and things like that. Hey, I can read your tarot cards, if you like?\u201d\n\u201cNo thanks.\u201d\n\u201cHow come you\u2019ve got all those scars?\u201d\nHe blinked, caught off guard. She was still smiling prettily, and seemed genuinely curious about him.\n\u201cJust got a lot of scars.\u201d He said, swallowing. \u201cDo you fancy a gin and tonic?\u201d He didn\u2019t actually have tonic, but he could pretend he\u2019d just forgotten and take it neat.\n\u201cYeah, why not,\u201d she nodded brightly. He got up, and she followed him into the kitchen, still talking, \u201cYou're not ill or anything, then?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus said. \u201cI got them fighting. Some of them I did myself.\u201d\n\u201cOh you poor thing.\u201d She said, her sympathy genuine. She leaned forward and squeezed his arm kindly. \u201cSorry to ask, love, you just can\u2019t be too careful, nowadays, do you know what I mean?\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d He poured the gin into two tumblers. He did know exactly what she meant, and he didn\u2019t want to talk about it. Or think about it.\nShe didn\u2019t complain when he handed her a tumbler of straight gin, just clicked their glasses together and beamed, \u201cCheers!\u201d then took a good gulp.\nThey went back to the couch. Remus took the bottle.\n\u201cYou\u2019re ever so tall, Remus. What are you, six three?\u201d\n\u201cSix two.\u201d\n\u201cI love tall men.\u201d She purred.\n\u201cMe too.\u201d\nAnthea laughed again at that, her plastic earrings clicking together. She chatted even more, telling him silly, nonsense things about herself; where she\u2019d been to school, her favourite songs on the radio, every film she\u2019d ever seen at the pictures. \u201cAnd I love a bit of dancing, too, that's how I met Neil, dancing down in Vauxhall. Shall I show you? Ok, you have to picture me in this sparkly purple dress, right? And my hair was shorter then.\u201d\nShe got up and began to dance to the record.\n\nOoh love,\n\n\nOoh loverboy\n\n\nWhat're you doin' tonight, hey boy\n\nSet my alarm, turn on my charm\n\n\n\nThat's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy\n\nRemus didn\u2019t need to picture the sparkly dress; she was a very good dancer. She twisted and wriggled with sensual energy, throwing flirtatious looks at him and flicking her hips. Stoned and relaxed, Remus slouched on the sofa watching her. She was dream like, pretty and graceful, but also overwhelmingly and unignorably\nreal\n. Remus wondered why he always ended up stuck with chatterboxes, and why on earth he liked it so much.\nThe song ended, and she held her arms aloft like a gymnast who had just completed a perfect routine. Remus smiled, despite himself, and applauded.\n\u201cFancy a dance?\u201d She fluttered her eyelashes flirtatiously. Remus couldn\u2019t help it; whatever she had rolled him was stronger than he was used to, and he was charmed by her.\n\u201cGo on, then.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t really dance, but he held her hands as she did, twirling her in the right places, and letting her fall into his arms, giggling. She had the most delicate wrists, the bones fine like a bird's.\nWhen they finally collapsed on the couch to smoke another joint, she kicked off her shoes and laid her legs over his lap. Grant did that sometimes; they only had the one sofa, so it was the only way to stretch out.\n\u201cYou\u2019re very handsome, Remus.\u201d She said through the smoke.\n\u201cHa.\u201d He replied, knocking back the last of his gin. He couldn\u2019t pour any more without pushing her legs off, and he didn\u2019t want to do that, so he settled for the joint.\n\u201cYou\nare\n. You\u2019re very sexy.\u201d\n\u201cShh.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cWho do you think you are? Showing up in my flat unannounced and interrogating me.\u201d\n\u201cAm I interrogating you?\u201d She widened her eyes, \u201cAre you succumbing to my techniques?\u201d\nRemus laughed, creasing over, his hands on her legs - they were so smooth and soft. She was giggling too, watching him. Her eyes were so dark and so full of life. He wanted her. Remus realised it all of a sudden, like a light being turned on - the room was brighter, her face clearer.\nBloody hell.\nHe finished the joint. She wriggled down on the couch and closed her eyes contentedly. He left his hands on her legs - just resting there, he didn\u2019t want to grab her or anything awful like that. He just wanted\u2026 what? What did you do with a girl? Mary was almost a decade ago, and it wasn\u2019t as if Remus had really played much of a role there. He\u2019d mostly just felt surprised she had picked him.\nHe felt like that now, too, as Anthea opened her eyes and smiled at him again.\n\u201cSorry, did you want to lie down too?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Remus\u2019s back prickled, alarmed. We're they\nreally\ngoing to?! \u201cNo! I mean\u2026 er\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so lovely,\u201d she grinned, shifting aside and pulling him down beside her, \u201cLet\u2019s just lie together for a bit, it's nice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cMm\u2026\u201d\nShe put her arm across him. Her soft black hair tickled under his nose, and he couldn\u2019t help but inhale her scent. It was warm and sort of spicy, like clove or cinnamon. He liked it. They lay for a bit, like that. The record had finished, and was just turning on its needle, crackling.\n\u201cWhat do you think Neil and Grant are doing now?\u201d Anthea whispered, her hand suddenly on his belt, palm flat against his crotch. \u201cProbably in the showers, do you reckon?\u201d\n\u201cUm.\u201d Remus said, speechless.\n\u201cYou ought to see Neil with his kit off, he\u2019s an Adonis. I mean, he\u2019s a dickhead, but you can forget all about it when he gets going - I bet they\u2019re all sweaty, and muddy from the pitch.\u201d\nRemus tried to regulate his breathing, but she kept moving her hand, and he was finding it hard to concentrate on anything else. Finally she looked up at him, and kissed his lips very tenderly. \u201cDo you fancy it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus breathed, \u201cGo on, then.\u201d\nAnthea was in the shower, two hours later, when Grant and Neil walked in the door. Remus was still sprawled on the couch in his underpants, flushed and completely stunned.\nGrant did a double take, and then burst out laughing. Neil looked appalled. He marched into the bathroom and demanded Anthea get out at once.\n\u201cYou slag!\u201d Grant wheezed at Remus, doubled over laughing.\n\u201cBye Grant, bye Remus!\u201d Anthea called as she and Neil hurried out. He had a face like thunder, and the door slammed hard behind them.\n\u201cWell then.\u201d Grant said, composing himself. \u201cI hope your girlfriend hasn\u2019t used up all the hot water.\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know why that happened.\u201d Remus said, pulling his t-shirt on. \u201cWe were just listening to records, and she was talking, and then\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat, it was the only way to shut her up?\u201d\nRemus looked up at him sheepishly, \u201cBelieve it or not, it didn\u2019t shut her up.\u201d\nIt took Grant almost ten full minutes to pull himself together.\n* * *\nThey got a TV, a few weeks after that - Grant joked that if Remus was so bored he\u2019d resorted to shagging girls, then they\u2019d better bring in some entertainment for him. He didn\u2019t see Anthea again, which was a pity, because to be honest, Remus wouldn\u2019t have minded making that a regular thing. Once you got used to all the talking, she was very sexy. He didn\u2019t think about what it meant too much, and Grant didn\u2019t push it.\nThe TV came second hand - neither of them had enough disposable income for a brand new one. They got it free off a friend of Grant\u2019s, on the condition that they picked it up themselves. It was only two streets over, but that still presented something of a problem.\n\u201cCan\u2019t you\u2026 hover it home, or something?\u201d Grant asked, hands on his hips as they stared down at the big, bulky TV set on the pavement. \u201cDo a spell.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s against the law.\u201d Remus explained. \u201cIn public, anyway. Or in front of mugg--you.\u201d\n\u201cPfft.\u201d Grant raised a hand to push his hair out of his sweaty face. \u201cBugger. Knew I ought to learn how to drive.\u201d\nThe door of the building opened, and a man walked out, looking flushed and shifty. That was the third man Remus had seen with exactly the same furtive look.\n\u201cWhat is this place, anyway?!\u201d He asked, peering up at the building. It looked like all the others - maybe a bit shabby. There was no outward signage.\n\u201cSauna,\u201d Grant said, squatting down to see if he could get his arms around the set. He could, but there was no way he could lift the thing.\n\u201cSauna?\u201d Remus scratched his head.\n\u201cYou know, a bath house. Where men can be alone together and get all sweaty.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Remus gaped, embarrassed.\n\u201cChrist Remus, we do live in Soho.\u201d\n\u201cI know! I just\u2026 anyway, don\u2019t lift it like that, you\u2019ll do your back in. Come on, take that end, I\u2019ll take this\u2026 one, two, three, up\u2026\u201d\nThey got it back in about thirty minutes, only taking one break. Remus was really doing most of the carrying, but he didn\u2019t mind; they\u2019d picked a day between the moons and he was feeling pretty healthy.\nLuckily, Grant was a dab hand at the electrical side, and managed to hook everything up once the TV was actually in the living room. It looked weird; a big black plastic cube, taking up all the space. They ended up putting it on a box in front of the fireplace, which they never used anyway. The aerial wasn\u2019t brilliant, and needed a bit of electrical tape to keep it upright, but once they switched the thing on, and the fuzzy picture came into view, they were both hooked.\nRemus, who hadn\u2019t watched any telly in years, was a complete addict that summer. He got hooked on soaps - EastEnders, Brookside and Coronation Street, but he\u2019d watch anything; debates in the house of commons, snooker championships, comedy, documentaries, top of the tops, and even a horrifically upsetting series called\nThreads\n, about the threat of nuclear war.\nThe TV went on first thing in the morning as he pottered around the flat getting dressed or brushing his teeth, and more often than not he fell asleep in front of it in the evenings. Grant started calling the set \u2018the other man\u2019.\n\u201cI just like the noise,\u201d Remus said, \u201cFor company.\u201d\n\u201cYou could try making some real friends\u2026\u201d Grant suggested. Remus dismissed this. He didn\u2019t need friends; he had everything he needed.\nOne Sunday afternoon they were both in the living room. Remus had to leave for a cleaning job which started at 3am, so he had been sleeping most of the day. Grant was reading the paper, and Remus\u2019s legs were across his lap. With his free hand, Grant was absent-mindedly rubbing the arch of Remus\u2019s left foot, which was making Remus sleepy and dozy again.\nThe News had just finished, and they were waiting for the weather when suddenly, sinister music began playing.\n\"\nThere is now a danger that has become a threat to us all\n,\" the television said ominously. \"\nIt is a deadly disease and there is no known cure...\"\nGrant and Remus both looked up to watch the creepy announcement. A word etched onto a blackened gravestone \u00a0- AIDS.\n\"\nDon't die of ignorance\n!\u201d The voiceover intoned.\nA familiar sense of shame and anxiety rushed through Remus, a sickly mix of emotion he hadn\u2019t felt since school. He pulled his feet off Grant, drawing his knees up to his chest. He felt dirty; untouchable.\n\u201cChrist.\u201d Grant said, his voice hollow, signalling to Remus that he was feeling exactly the same way. \u201cS'enough to make ya give up on shagging altogether, innit.\u201d He shook his head.\nRemus bit his lip.\n\"\nYou\u2019re\nbeing safe, aren't you?\" He asked tentatively.\n\"Yeah, obviously.\" Grant nodded, brusquely.\nRemus looked up at him, twisting his mouth. He hated bringing up Grant\u2019s other liaisons, and Grant was always very discreet about it. Not guilty, or secretive, but discreet. Still, Remus wanted to be as sure as he could.\n\"Good. I mean, you're using...\"\nGrant stood up, hands on his hips, clearly annoyed.\n\"Yes, Remus, when I fuck other men I make sure there are condoms handy.\"\n\"Sorry.\" Remus blushed, looking down at his hands. \"It's none of my business.\"\n\"Right. It\u2019s not.\" Grant snapped, agitated, and went into the kitchen.\nRemus heard him fill the kettle and then flick it on, then he smelled cigarette smoke. He ran his fingers through his hair, flustered, and called through the wall;\n\"I just\u2026 you know I couldn't bear it, if I didn't have you.\"\nQuiet. Footsteps.\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Grant asked, reappearing.\n\u201cMe?!\u201d Remus blinked.\nGrant folded his arms, leaning in the doorframe.\n\u201cDon\u2019t treat me like an idiot, I know I\u2019m not your one and only. And it wasn\u2019t just Anth, neither. Whoever you see, when you go off every month. When you\u2019re\u2026 when you\u2019re not yourself.\u201d\nRemus stared at him, his mouth dry. He blinked again, and nodded.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be safe.\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t do without you either.\u201d Grant said, ruffling Remus\u2019s hair. \u201cInsensitive wanker. Cup of tea?\u201d\nRemus nodded, glad they weren\u2019t fighting, but troubled all the same. Grant was quite right, of course. Remus had never given protection a second thought with Castor. Could wizards get it? If they could, then was there a magical cure? Remus had seen pictures of AIDs sufferers from America; skeletal men in hospital beds. He shuddered.\nGrant came back through with two cups of tea. He handed one to Remus, then sat down beside him, crossed his legs and raised the mug to his lips, blowing on it. He sipped, and then looked up, thoughtfully. \u201cI could stop.\u201d\n\u201cEh?\u201d Remus blinked, lost in his own thoughts.\n\u201cI could stop seeing other people.\u201d Grant repeated patiently. \u201cIf you wanted me to, I mean. All you have to do is ask.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to tell you what you can and can\u2019t--\u201d\n\u201cRemus.\u201d Grant raised an eyebrow, \u201cI\u2019ve been living here for four years. You\u2019re a right dickhead sometimes, but you make me happy.\u201d\nRemus was staring at the carpet, now, trying not to panic.\nGrant set down his tea, and reached over to touch Remus\u2019s hand, \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone but you.\u201d He said, sincerely.\n\u201cGrant, I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Grant put a hand up, \u201cI\u2019m not expecting you to say it back, it\u2019s ok. I know how you feel, and that\u2019s enough.\u201d\nRemus inhaled sharply and closed his eyes. He exhaled slowly, and willed his heart to slow down. It was a lovely thing to hear. He had never for a moment expected to feel this way again - or for it to be so very different from the last time.\n\u201cOk.\u201d He breathed.\n\u201cOk?\u201d Grant cocked his head.\n\u201cOk,\u201d Remus nodded, \u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t see anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cDeal.\u201d"

They were still best friends, they still made each other laugh and irritated each other beyond belief, but a fresh new closeness had developed too. Remus drank less for a while - he didn\u2019t stop altogether, and some days were very hard, some days he didn\u2019t wash, or get out of bed, or eat. But not every day; and that was progress.\nCastor didn\u2019t take it well. In fact, he was furious. Remus even tried to explain HIV to him, but it was no good. Castor had grown so far away from humanity, he was even starting to look wolfish. His hair was thicker, blacker somehow, and extended down past the nape of his neck, creeping along his spine. His teeth were lengthening, his eyes sharper, the irises turning yellow.\n\u201cYou are turning your back on your family, Remus Lupin.\u201d He snarled. \u201cEven your magic grows weaker.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not turning my back on anything.\u201d Remus insisted, \u201cI\u2019m trying to have a real life.\u201d\nOf course Castor didn\u2019t understand; Remus kept Castor and Grant so separate that they didn\u2019t even know each others\u2019 names. Maybe he\u2019d always known he\u2019d have to pick one of them in the end. And Castor had never felt right.\nIn the end, Remus was banished from the pack. He was warned that if he ever returned, he would be treated as a threat. This was extreme, but he supposed that\u2019s just what you got for breaking a werewolf\u2019s heart.\nNow Remus had to spend the full moons in Britain. He returned to some of his old haunts; the Lake District, the Brecon Beacons. He tried not to go anywhere there were too many memories of Prongs and Wormtail. Or the other one. To make matters worse, without the pack to help him heal every month, Remus had to apparate back to London and tend to his wounds as best he could.\n\u201cChrist!\u201d Grant exclaimed, the first time it was really bad. He walked in on Remus in the bathroom, disinfecting his cuts, his wand shaking as he tried to grip it with broken fingers.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Remus murmured, bracing himself against the sink as a dizzy spell threatened to overwhelm him. He hadn\u2019t felt so dreadful after a transformation since\u2026 since\u2026 his vision clouded, and he sat down on the closed toilet lid, head between his knees so he didn\u2019t faint.\n\u201cChrist!\u201d Grant said again, coming in and kneeling in front of him. He took the bloody cotton ball Remus had been using, and tossed it in the bin. He grabbed the tub from the side of the sink, plus the bottle of TCP. \u201cCome here, you,\u201d he said softly, taking Remus\u2019s hand very gently in his, and dabbing it lightly with the disinfectant.\nRemus sat there dumbly, letting himself be looked after, too tired to do much else.\n\u201cFor god\u2019s sake,\u201d Grant shook his head, visibly upset, \u201cWe can\u2019t have you in this state every month, can we my darling?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d Remus mumbled, \u201cThis isn\u2019t too bad.\u201d\n\u201cMy arse!\u201d Grant retorted, getting up to look for plasters in the medicine cabinet. He found them and knelt down again, resuming his work on Remus\u2019s scrapes. \u201cTell you what, if it\u2019s a choice between you coming back like this every month or giving that wolfy fucker a few blowjobs then I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d\nRemus laughed, which hurt his ribs. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it works like that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ve got to do something.\u201d Grant grumbled, binding Remus\u2019s broken fingers tightly together with the plasters.\n\u201cYou\u2019re good at this,\u201d Remus said, surprised, looking down at the neat work Grant had made.\n\u201cYeah, well, if you get battered as much as I\u2019ve been, you pick up some tricks,\u201d Grant looked up and winked. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget I went on that first aid course for work. Come on then, let\u2019s get you to bed. Are you hungry?\u201d\n\u201cSort of.\u201d He was starving, but he knew there was no food in. They were waiting for payday to do a big shop.\n\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d Grant said, helping him through to the bedroom.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, I\u2019ll probably just sleep.\u201d\n\u201cGod, you look so pale,\u201d Grant felt Remus\u2019s forehead with the back of his hand. \u201cI fink you ought to eat something.\u201d\n\u201cHonestly, I look worse than I feel.\u201d Remus climbed into bed, his bones wept with relief.\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe you.\u201d Grant got in with him, and sat up, stroking Remus\u2019s hair. It was very soothing. \u201cDid\u2026 did Sirius used to look after you? After full moons?\u201d\nRemus screwed his eyes up, shook his head, \u201cPlease don\u2019t. I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cOh love.\u201d Grant sighed, resuming his tender stroking. \u201cYou know, my friend who does the counselling, she says she\u2019ll still give you an appointment. Just say the word. Helped me a lot, you don\u2019t know how much.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Remus said. He always said the same. \u201cThere are too many lies I\u2019d have to tell.\u201d\n\u201cNah, I\u2019ve been thinking - it doesn\u2019t have to be about the war, or even the wolf thing. Just talk to her about James and Lily and Peter. Say it was a car crash, or--\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cRemus, I just want you to talk--\u201d\n\u201cYou know, I really don\u2019t feel well. Can you leave me alone, please?\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Grant got up. Remus kept his eyes shut, but he could hear every movement. Just before he left the room, Grant turned back. \u201cI found that bottle of gin in your sock drawer, by the way. Poured it down the sink.\u201d\nHe slammed the door.\n* * *\n\n*Ring ring* *Ring ring*\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\u201cMary?\u201d\n\u201cRemus?\u201d There was a brief silence on the end of the line, as Mary collected herself. Remus knew that feeling. Sometimes he\u2019d be reminded something from the old days, and it would knock all the air out of him. \u201cHi!\u201d She said, her voice carrying an overwide smile. \u201cHow are you, sweetheart?\u201d\n\u201cOh, you know. I\u2019m not disturbing you?\u201d He always tried to give her an easy out, if she wanted it.\n\u201cOf course not... Just had our tea.\u201d\n\u201cOh nice, what did you have?\u201d\n\u201cChicken and rice. Darren\u2019s favourite.\u201d\n\u201cSounds good.\u201d\n\u201cYou ought to come for dinner, one evening. Still in London, are you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026 same flat.\u201d\n\u201cOh, of course. Is that\u2026? Um. How is that?\u201d\n\u201cIt's ok.\u201d He said, glancing around at his shabby living room. \u201cBeen here so long now I s\u2019pose it feels like it's always been just mine.\u201d\n\u201cSeeing anyone?\u201d\n\u201cSort of.\u201d\n\u201cWorking?\u201d\n\u201cCleaning. Off and on, when I can get it. I was stacking shelves for a bit, over in Epping, but I fell asleep on the job and they sacked me.\u201d\n\u201cBe gentle with yourself, love.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He took a drink from his beer bottle. \u201cHow\u2019s your job?\u201d\n\u201cGood! Turns out I might have been awful at transfiguration, but accounting is no big deal.\u201d\nDarren had opened a garage in late \u201885, and Mary worked there too, taking care of all the bookings and the invoicing. They were saving up to move out of their tower block, and get a little house with a garden. She only used magic very occasionally, she told Remus, though her relationship with her wand had never been quite the same since finding the McKinnons.\n\u201cRemus? Are you still there?\u201d\n\u201cSorry, yeah. Drifted off.\u201d\n\u201cI do that too\u2026\u201d a pause, and Remus got that sick, tight feeling in his stomach. He could guess what was coming next. Mary raised her voice, slightly, \u201cHave you got someone to talk to? Whoever it is you\u2019re \u2018sort of\u2019 seeing, do they know what happened?\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d Remus made a noncommittal noise. \u201cBits and pieces.\u201d\n\u201cBecause you ought to talk about it, Remus. You shouldn\u2019t have to carry all of that\u2026 I can\u2019t imagine how it must feel, the betrayal--\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus snapped, \u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d and he slammed down the phone, as hard as he could, so that he knocked it off the table. He finished his beer before moving to pick it up.\n\nFuck her, then.\n\nEveryone wanted him to talk, but none of them\nreally\nknew. None of them\ncould\nknow - how stupid he felt, how used. Lily and James and Peter and Marlene - losing them was one thing. Remus had taught himself to focus on the best memories, the happiest times.\nBut Sirius. There was not one moment of their time together that wasn\u2019t tainted; poisoned by the lies Black had been telling. Remus had been open, and vulnerable and loving, and every moment of it had been false.\nHe had been made a fool of by the only person he had ever loved. He was\npathetic\n; too blinded by emotion to see the truth, and now there was nothing left of him. He would never be capable of that kind of softness ever again. Remus\u2019s hatred for Sirius was so overwhelming sometimes it frightened him.\nSo how was he supposed to talk about that? How was he supposed to tell Grant, or some therapist, that he was not merely angry, not merely grieving, but\nparalysed\nby rage? That he sometimes dreamed about getting to Azkaban somehow, and killing Sirius himself. That once or twice in the first few months after the war, he had gone so far as to actually get up in the night, drunk and furious, grabbed his wand, and planned to do exactly that. The only thing that stopped him was the thought of getting splinched, or having to face all those dementors.\nHe kicked the coffee table, furiously, stubbing his toe.\n\u201cBugger!\u201d\nGrant poked his head around the corner of the living room door. \u201cDidn\u2019t go well, then?\u201d\n\u201cThere's no point trying.\u201d Remus huffed, rubbing his foot and hopping across the room to flick on the t.v. \u201cShe\u2019s happy. She's got her life together. I should just leave her to it.\u201d He collapsed back into the sofa.\n\u201cIs that what she said?\u201d Grant came in, reproachfully.\n\u201cNo. But it\u2019s what\u2019s fair.\u201d Remus kept his eyes fixed on the screen, slouching down further. Maybe Grant would get the message:\nI don\u2019t want to talk!\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you invite her over one saturday?\u201d Grant sat on the arm of the couch. \u201cI\u2019d like to meet her.\u201d\n\u201cNo point. She wouldn\u2019t come. Too many memories here.\u201d\n\u201cWe could go out then, go for lunch somewhere nice.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford that.\u201d\nGrant rubbed his temples, wincing as if he was getting a headache, \u201cYou\u2019re being childish.\u201d He said.\n\u201cPiss off.\u201d\n\u201cBrilliant rebuttal, that,\u201d Grant snorted, \u201cCome on, what happened to the clever clogs I used to fancy the pants off? Use your big words.\u201d\n\u201cLook, you wanted me to call Mary and I did. It ended badly, like I knew it would, and that\u2019s that. Just leave me alone, will you?!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I can imagine exactly\nwhy\nit ended badly, too, and I don\u2019t need to be a bloody magician to work it out.\u201d\n\u201cWizard.\u201d\n\u201cDickhead. From what you\u2019ve told me she\u2019s a nice girl. And she knows you. I just thought she\u2019d be someone to talk to about--\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well,\nshe\ndoesn\u2019t want to talk about it any more than I do.\u201d Remus spat. \u201cShe told me to talk to\nyou\n.\u201d\n\u201cShe did?\u201d Grant blinked. Remus felt especially cruel.\n\u201cWell. Obviously she doesn\u2019t know you by name. Just whoever I\u2019m shagging, right now.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Grant made an obvious effort to ignore this slight. \u201cWell, come on then.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Sunday, I\u2019ve got nothing to do. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cRemus. I can\u2019t go on like this.\u201d Grant said. \u201cI love you, I do, but this is too---\u201d\nFuck.\nAlarm bells started going off inside Remus\u2019s head.\nIt was as if someone had started flashing the lights on and off, and the walls were closing in, and all the air had left the room, and he was dizzy, drowning, blinded. There was a weird taste in his mouth, and he thought he might be sick, except he couldn\u2019t breathe enough to retch, just kept gasping, tumbling forward.\n\u201cHey, hey hey!\u201d Grant\u2019s voice penetrated the fog, echoing and distant. \u201cRemus? Remus, can you take a deep breath? In on one, out on two, ok? One\u2026\u201d\nRemus felt sweat trickle down his back, his heart thudding into overdrive, but he breathed in, as much as he could. \u201cTwo\u2026\u201d Grant said. He was rubbing his back very slowly. Remus let out a long shaky breath. \u201cThat\u2019s so good,\u201d Grant said, voice louder now, \u201cSo good, Remus, well done. And again, one\u2026 two\u2026\u201d\nThey must have sat there for almost two full minutes, just breathing together. Eventually, Remus felt halfway normal again. Except he really, really wanted a drink.\n\u201cSee,\u201d Grant said, using the voice that Remus was sure he reserved for the troubled kids he worked with, \u201cThis is why I need you to talk to me. We can\u2019t have this, can we?\u201d\nRemus shook his head, but didn\u2019t trust himself to speak.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I said what I said,\u201d Grant continued, \u201cI didn't mean it. There\u2019s no \u2018buts\u2019, ok? I love you, and you\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d\nRemus nodded again, head still in his hands, eyes shut tight. He had to be getting the flu, or something; people didn\u2019t get dizzy just from\nnot talking\n, surely. Only\u2026 only Grant saying that; \u2018I can\u2019t go on\u2026\u2019 it had ignited such dread inside him, such terror, maybe there was something to it.\n\u201cWhat if you tell me just one thing?\u201d Grant tried, \u201cJust one thing to help me understand?\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Remus choked.\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d he could practically hear Grant\u2019s mind whirring. Did he have a list of things he wanted to pry out of Remus, all saved up for just this occasion? Was this some stupid psychoanalysis bullshit Grant had picked up on a training course?\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never told me what happened to Sirius. I know he\u2019s not dead. Did he\u2026 leave?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, in a manner of speaking.\u201d Remus grunted. God, hearing someone else say his name hurt so much. He felt dizzy all over again.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s in prison.\u201d Remus said. Then he breathed in again, and forced out the rest. \u201cHe\u2019s in prison because he murdered them, and I wasn\u2019t here to stop any of it.\u201d\n\u201cFucking hell.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d Remus braced himself for more questions. But none came. Grant just slipped his arm over his shoulder and gave him a squeeze,\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d Remus returned, still looking down. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how stupid I was. I missed all the signs. I\nknew\nsomething was wrong, but I thought\u2026 I thought it was just me; I thought he wanted to break up. I was so selfish, I never thought for a second that he would\u2026 that he\ncould\u2026\n\u201d He was crying now.\nStupid Grant.\n\u201cIt\u2019s his fault for letting you down, not\nyour\nfault for trusting him.\u201d Grant kept hugging him. Remus allowed it, to make him feel better; to make this seem like a breakthrough.\nBut Grant could say that all he wanted - Mary had said something similar, once or twice over the years. It just didn\u2019t ring true. The dead were still dead, and Remus had not been there to prevent any of it. Even if he had been there, that Halloween night; the way he\u2019d been back then, he probably would have let Sirius kill him, too, rather than try to fight him.\nBack then, dying for love had seemed the only worthy cause. But he was older, now, and he knew the truth. Never again. Never, never."

            "content": "When I look back upon my life\n\n\n\n\nIt's always with a sense of shame\n\n\n\n\nI've always been the one to blame\n\n\n\n\nFor everything I long to do\n\n\n\n\nNo matter when or where or who\n\n\n\n\nHas one thing in common, too;\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin\n\n\n\n\nIt's a sin\n\n\n\n\nIn the spring on 1987, Remus had a spot of luck. One of Grant\u2019s old student friends now worked in the Law Department at UCL and managed to swing a job for Remus doing some freelance editing. This was a revelation; he could do the bulk of it at home, and then just take it up to Holborn once it was done. He did need to get a national insurance card, and a muggle bank account, but that was easy enough with a few tactical glamour spells at the bank.\n\n\nRemus only cheated a little bit, using magic to help him read and correct spelling, but he found the work surprisingly enjoyable, and even started a little business marking exam papers for some of the local muggle schools.\n\n\n\u201cDunno how you can concentrate so long.\u201d Grant shook his head at the pile of papers Remus had amassed one evening. \u201cI\u2019d go out of my mind.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting,\u201d Remus shrugged, \u201cI never got the chance to learn any of this stuff. Have you heard of quadratic equations?\u201d\n\n\nGrant laughed at him fondly and ruffled his hair, \u201cYou boffin.\u201d\n\n\nGrant himself had been going from strength to strength at work. He loved his job, and put in extra time on the weekends and evenings whenever he could. The boys Grant worked with were every bit as much trouble as the St Edmund\u2019s boys, but that only seemed to spur Grant on. He was always telling Remus about one kid or another who\u2019d had a little victory - a passing mark at school, a week without a fight, time off their sentence. Somehow Grant knew everything about everyone; his memory limitless, his capacity for pride and encouragement unbelievable.\n\n\n\u201cGot to cut out that article in the Observer,\u201d he might say one evening, \u201cSounds right up Alfie\u2019s street.\u201d Or, \u201cStaying late tomorrow, with any luck - promised the older lads we\u2019d have a kick-about if none of them get written up.\u201d\n\n\nWhen he was feeling insecure sometimes Remus would wonder if Grant was only with him because he too was a troubled boy. That Grant was just trying to save him; like he tried to save everybody. He lived for a good cause.\n\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Grant would grin at him, if he raised these concerns. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to get in your pants since we were teenagers, it\u2019s got nothing to do with your tortured past.\u201d\n\n\nAnd then Remus would remember that after all, Grant was a care home kid himself. Something which was easy to forget, because unlike Remus, he bore it lightly, with a casual shrug of acceptance. Poverty, lack of education, mistreatment - none of this weighed Grant down in the same way. At least not on the surface. But Remus had been wrong about people before.\n\n\nAs a result of Grant\u2019s dedication to his work, and Remus\u2019s own relatively low impact employment, Remus found himself in a position he had never been in before - having both free time and a bit of disposable income.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t need much - the flat was paid for, their furniture was serviceable, and they could generally afford to keep the electric and hot water on. He bought clothes every once in a while, but he hardly shopped at Harrods. There was the drink, but he reasoned that as he didn\u2019t smoke any more, he could put his tobacco money towards booze.\n\n\nWhat Remus did enjoy doing was going for walks. Not countryside rambles - he got enough of that on full moons - but wandering through London by himself, enjoying the streets, the people. He visited every free museum in London - the National Gallery, the Portrait Gallery, the V&A, the British Museum. He became quite cultured, in fact. And if his hip hurt (which it often did, now, as he entered his late twenties), he could easily hop on a bus.\n\n\nSo, one summer's day, he had completed all of his marking, and there was nothing on TV, Grant would not be home for hours, so he mooched around the Science Museum for an hour or so. Funnily enough, it put him in mind of Arthur Weasley, for the first time in years. The daft old bugger would love all of the machines, the pistons, the lightbulbs. He could just picture Arthur\u2019s face as he watched the perpetual motion machine, and Remus smiled to himself, quite out of the blue. How was Arthur? And his wife, the Prewetts\u2019 sister, and their redhaired brood? It had been too long now to get in touch, Remus knew, and he wouldn\u2019t know what to say, even if he did.\n\n\nStill, thinking about the Weasleys hadn\u2019t hurt, which was the main thing. And perhaps thinking about them put him in a different mindframe for the afternoon - more alert, maybe, or nostalgic. It couldn\u2019t be a coincidence that he bumped into an old friend only two hours later.\n\n\nHe was nearly home, only a street or so away, shuffling anonymously through the bustling Chinatown alleyways. In fact, he was just about to pass the place they\u2019d got their tv - the sauna off Old Compton Street. Remus always blushed a bit, walking past it, and then chastised himself for being such a prude. He ducked his head slightly, as he approached, and - horror of horrors - just as he was level with the door somebody stepped out of it.\n\n\nRemus had to stop short, so as not to bump into them. They turned and stared up at him, nervously.\n\n\nRemus gasped. \u201cChristopher!\u201d\n\n\nThe man blinked, horrified. He was red faced with dark brown eyes that were rather small and watery. He was a bit chubbier than he had been at school, and his hairline was receding slightly at the temples. But it was definitely him.\n\n\n\u201cRemus?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHi! It's been\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot since\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah. How are you?\u201d Remus winced even as he asked the question. Christopher was so clearly uncomfortable - and why shouldn\u2019t he be? He hadn\u2019t seen Remus in almost ten years, and now here he was, looming over him outside a gay sauna.\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 you know.\u201d Christopher looked at his feet.\n\n\nHe was wearing muggle clothes - a stonewashed denim shirt with the buttons done up unevenly, dress trousers and a burnt orange waistcoat with green embroidery. In short, he looked as dreadful as every pureblood wizard who tried to pass as a muggle. As always, Christopher\u2019s general air of hopelessness endeared Remus to him.\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Remus rubbed the back of his head. \u201cDo you want to\u2026 um. Got time for a coffee? Or a drink? Catch up a bit?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk then\u2026\u201d Christopher looked up at him, cautiously.\n\n\nRemus took charge from that point, because it was clear there was no other way. He led Christopher further up the street, back towards Tottenham Court Road. There was a cafe on Denmark Street that was cheap and anonymous, and for some reason Remus wanted to get further away from home.\n\n\n\u201cHere we are,\u201d he smiled kindly, holding the door open and pointing out an available table. Christopher said nothing, and sat down, fidgeting a bit. Remus wondered if this was all a terrible idea - maybe Chris didn\u2019t want to speak to him. But he went along with it, and offered to pay when Remus went to order their coffees.\n\n\n\u201cDo you live nearby?\u201d Christopher asked, finally, still not fully making eye contact.\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus nodded, \u201cNot far. You?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, no. Out in Hampshire. I just come into the city for work, and\u2026 well.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere do you work now?\u201d Remus asked, desperate to spare him any further embarrassment.\n\n\n\u201cGringotts.\u201d Chris said, glancing up at the waitress as their coffees arrived. He put three sugars in his, and as much milk as he could - Remus realised he hadn\u2019t even asked if Chris\n\n\nliked\n\n\ncoffee.\n\n\n\u201cVery swish,\u201d Remus smiled, \u201cAlways knew you\u2019d do well.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI suppose.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStill read lots?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s time\u2026 work keeps me busy. And other responsibilities, you know how it is. I thought we were overworked during NEWTs, but Hogwarts was a holiday compared to real life.\u201d\n\n\nRemus chewed the inside of his cheek, because that was very true, and he didn\u2019t want to get upset about it.\n\n\n\u201cHow about you?\u201d Christopher asked, clearly trying not to grimace as he sipped his coffee. \u201cWhat do you do, now?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis and that,\u201d Remus shrugged. \u201cHaven\u2019t exactly got a career.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, what a shame.\u201d\n\n\nRemus shrugged, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I manage.\u201d\n\n\nThere was an awkward silence. Remus wanted to ask about the sauna, but he knew better. Grant would probably ask, but then Grant had a way of putting people at ease which Remus didn\u2019t. He just drank his coffee quietly, and wished he\u2019d suggested a pub, instead.\n\n\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d died.\u201d Christopher said, suddenly. Remus nearly choked. He set down his coffee.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere were so many rumours, back then - you remember what it was like. And there were all these names, and when I saw what had happened to Lily, and your friend James, I just thought\u2026 especially after it came out that Sirius Black was the one who did it, I just assumed...\u201d\n\n\nRemus breathed in, sharply, and waited for the pain to retreat. When it did, he exhaled slowly, and said, very evenly,\n\n\n\u201cNo. I wasn\u2019t there, that night. I had no idea what Black was up to. No one did.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe was always up to something,\u201d Christopher said, darkly. \u201cAnd with his family\u2026 I suppose it didn\u2019t come as much of a surprise, really.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus said, not really knowing what he was saying anymore, just trying to ignore the roaring in his head, \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was so upset about Lily, though. She was kind. Do you know where Harry is, now? The boy who lived?\u201d\n\n\nRemus just shook his head. He drank more coffee - probably not a brilliant idea to add caffeine to his already speeding heart rate, but he was trying to be as normal as possible.\n\n\n\u201cIf you weren\u2019t dead,\u201d Christopher continued, \u201cI thought you might just not want to talk to me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know you and your friends were all involved in the war - helping Dumbledore and everything. I didn\u2019t\u2026 my parents sent me to Sweden, after I finished my NEWTs. They were worried about me, they wanted me out of the way. You remember what things were like.\u201d\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n, Remus wanted to say,\n\n\nyes, I bloody remember. Sometimes I wake up and it\u2019s like it\u2019s still happening.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd with us being purebloods\u2026 I think they were worried I\u2019d have to pick a side. So they sent me away - we have family in Gothenburg, and I got my qualification in Magical Finance.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Remus nodded. He really needed to talk about something else. \u201cGood for you, Chris. So, um\u2026 are you in Soho often?\u201d\n\n\nChristopher turned crimson again, and looked down at his mug of coffee. \u201cOnly\u2026 only sometimes. Honestly, I just heard about that place and thought I\u2019d take a look, I didn\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t want you to think\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know you ought to be careful,\u201d Remus said, lowering his voice in case any of the cafe patrons were listening in, \u201cThere\u2019s this illness the muggles are getting - I\u2019m not sure how much your lot know about it, but it\u2019s really serious.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLike I said,\u201d Christopher said, \u201cI barely go there, really. Just stupid curiosity.\u201d\n\n\nRemus felt a twinge of guilt, for making Christopher feel bad. If Grant had taught him anything, it was that you should never add to anyone\u2019s personal shame. It was a wasted emotion anyway, no need to make it worse.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being curious,\u201d Remus said, gently, \u201cLots of people go to those places.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you?\u201d Christopher looked up at him.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus said, a bit too quickly. \u201cEr\u2026 I mean, you know I was never very sociable.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, of course. I can imagine, after everything that happened\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t want to get onto that, so he changed the subject, \u201cSeeing anyone?\u201d he asked, \u201cGot a boyfriend?\u201d\n\n\nChristopher shook his head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s difficult, you know. The job I have, my family. Things have been\u2026 well, there\u2019s been a fair bit of trial and error, in that respect.\u201d\n\n\nRemus wanted to squeeze his hand over the table, but it wasn\u2019t really the place. He tilted his head, sympathetically,\n\n\n\u201cIt will get better, Chris.\u201d\n\n\nChristopher looked at him with a resigned smile. \u201cMm, yes, I remember you saying something like that before, at school. Someone for everyone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, there is.\u201d Remus nodded, encouragingly. \u201cMore than one person, even.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Chris sighed, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s healthy to think like that. There are so many factors to consider, and I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t think it works like in books. I don\u2019t think everyone has that experience.\u201d\n\n\nThat was a difficult thing to hear. Remus didn\u2019t know what to say, really, and felt weirdly self-conscious and naive. Certainly, Remus did not glamourise romance any more - if he ever had at all. Love had beaten the shit out of him on more than one occasion. But it had also been the only thing worth living for. It had lifted him, protected him, and kept him human. He had a sudden longing to see Grant, and wondered if he\u2019d be home yet.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel sorry for me,\u201d Christopher said, briskly, checking his pocket watch, \u201cI have a nice enough time. I like my work, I make plenty of money, and when I get a free evening I still\u2026 you know, I\u2019m able to enjoy myself once in a while. I just see it as a treat, rather than a lifestyle. Actually,\u201d he leaned in a little, \u201cI have a flat in Kensington - for when I work late, and don\u2019t want to apparate all the way home. It\u2019s nice there, if you\u2019d like to see it.\u201d He raised an eyebrow suggestively.\n\n\nRemus\u2019s mouth went dry, and he swallowed, flustered,\n\n\n\u201cUm. Nice of you to offer, really, but. I\u2019d better be getting home. I\u2019ve got someone waiting.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Christopher sat up straighter, withdrawing. His face seemed to close up. \u201cYou\u2019ve got someone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, for a few years, now.\u201d Almost six, he realised. Longer than he\u2019d had Sirius - if he\u2019d ever really had Sirius.\n\n\n\u201cWell. Good for you, then. Look, I\u2019d better go, Remus, it was very nice to see you again.\u201d Christopher stood up, and extended a formal hand for Remus to shake. \u201cWe ought to have a proper catch up, one of these days, let me know if you\u2019re ever in Diagon Alley, perhaps, I\u2019ll arrange lunch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk,\u201d Remus nodded, shaking his hand.\n\n\nHe knew he would never be in Diagon Alley, and as Christopher didn\u2019t give him any contact details Remus assumed that the invitation was merely politeness. He did not miss pureblood hypocrisy.\n\n\nRemus walked home quickly, ignoring the ache in his hip, and was relieved beyond belief to find Grant already there, in the kitchen.\n\n\n\u201cWotcher, boffin,\u201d he grinned, \u201cHow was the museum?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood, thanks. Interesting.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReckon I should take some of the lads there on a trip, if I can get it past the governor.\u201d He held up two tins, \u201cBeans on toast, or spaghetti hoops on toast?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhichever you prefer,\u201d Remus said, watching him. Grant looked at them both cheerfully,\n\n\n\u201cHoops then. With lots of Worcestershire, eh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSounds perfect.\u201d Remus breathed.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nPerfect\n\n\n,\u201d Grant chuckled, \u201cYou must be hungry.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I just\u2026 just missed you, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve only been at work.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDaft sod.\u201d Grant shook his head, still smiling, turning his back to open the cutlery drawer and find the tin opener.\n\n\nRemus crossed the room quickly, and hugged him, wrapping his arms around Grant\u2019s waist, pulling him in and inhaling the scent of him. Grant set down the tin opener carefully, and hugged Remus back, rubbing his arms. \u201cYou alright, sweetheart?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMmmhm.\u201d Remus said, into his neck. \u201cJust glad you\u2019re here.\u201d"

Because of course, he had Grant.\n\u201cWhat about that Mary bird? Sends you letters all the time.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah. I could get her something, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit, Ebenezer.\u201d\nRemus shrugged off the teasing, because he knew Grant loved Christmas - or any opportunity to celebrate, really - and Grant had had a very difficult year.\nHaving worked so hard to gain his school leaving certificate, pushing every step of the way to get A-Levels and various other qualifications, all so that he could have his dream job, which was helping other people, Grant had finally come up against an insurmountable opponent. The government - more specifically, The Local Government Act.\nIn 1988, Section 28 passed, and Grant was no longer secure in his position at work. Remus hadn\u2019t really understood it at first, or at least, couldn\u2019t see why Grant should have to worry.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t work for the council, though,\u201d he frowned, flicking through the leaflets Grant and his friends had been printing for awareness-raising.\n\u201cYes I do,\u201d Grant replied, \u201cLocal authority includes schools and Borstals - and that's what it\u2019s really about. They don\u2019t want us perverting kids.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Remus said.\n\u201cI know.\u201d\nRemus re-read the text.\n\nA local authority shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality, or promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship.\n\n\u201cPretended?!\u201d Remus shook his head.\n\u201cI know.\u201d Grant sighed.\n\u201cWhat does this mean, though? \u2018Promote\u2019 homosexuality? How do you promote it?\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s where the cunts have been clever, innit.\u201d Grant huffed, \u201cIt don\u2019t mean anything, not really. Just means if anyone wants to argue against it the fucking Tories can accuse them of wanting to \u2018promote\u2019 queerness or some bollocks.\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCompletely mental? Evil? Immoral. Yeah. My mate Gay Bob, he\u2019s already had to shut down the Gay Youths Support group, only started that last year. And my place ain\u2019t exempt, the governor's already asking for a list of books we carry, check none of them are too queer.\u201d\n\u201cBut they can\u2019t\u2026 they wouldn\u2019t\nsack\nyou?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, love. I\u2019m already trying to keep my head down over the AIDs thing.\u201d\nRemus felt even worse about that. The staff at the centre Grant worked at had all been hauled into a meeting one day, and told in no uncertain terms that if any one of them contracted HIV, then they would be dismissed without notice - and the police would be notified. That was terrifying enough.\nFor the past eighteen months, Grant had been working tirelessly with his friends and various groups to appeal Section 28, and it wasn\u2019t going well at all. He\u2019d almost been arrested at one protest, and caught a black eye off an anti-protester at another.\n\u201cIt\u2019s war.\u201d he said fiercely, when he returned, and Remus made him sit still so he could heal it, \u201cIt\u2019s us and them, that\u2019s how they want it, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ll get.\u201d\nRemus did not know what to say. He didn\u2019t want a war, he just wanted to be left alone. He never said that, though, because deep down, he was very proud of Grant\u2019s barefaced refusal to give up or give even an inch. He had always admired bravery most of all.\nSo, in late December, Remus and Grant bundled themselves up in woolly hats, gloves and scarves, and walked through the wintry grey city to Oxford Circus. Grant was right - the prat - the lights were great. Strung across the wide street like jungle vines, great gleaming golden bulbs illuminated the cheerful red double deckers, the shiny black cabs, the glorious silver and green window displays.\nIt was true, Remus had been avoiding Christmas and all its trappings, just like he avoided his birthdays. He was worried they\u2019d send him hurtling backwards - to Hogwarts, to the Potters mansion, to all of his most bittersweet memories. It was very hard to be without his friends at that time of year.\nBut there was something very cleansing about the chaos of shopping on Oxford Street. The noise and the bustle and the smells ensured that he couldn\u2019t sulk for very long, and Grant\u2019s enthusiasm for the season did the rest.\n\u201cRight, let\u2019s have a look for Mary\u2019s pressie first, shall we?\u201d He grinned up at Remus, bouncing on the balls of his feet. \u201cHouse of Fraser? Or is she a Selfridges girl?\u201d\n\u201cWhichever is trendier, I s\u2019pose,\u201d Remus said. \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d\n\u201cGawd, I\u2019ve no idea. Bath shit?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus nodded, \u201cBath shit. Or perfume?\u201d\n\u201cOoh, perfume, eh?\u201d Grant nudged him with his elbow, \u201cThat\u2019s intimate. Should I be worried?\u201d\n\u201cAbout Mary?\u201d Remus snorted, \u201cYou\u2019d be too late.\u201d\nThey wandered through the perfume departments of three or four big department stores. Remus somewhat regretted his choice, then - his hypersensitive sense of smell meant that he was already nursing a headache after the first stop.\nHe eventually settled on something floral, in a pink and gold bottle, because it was pretty, and stylish, and Mary was pretty and stylish. He even had it gift wrapped, in gold paper with a red satin bow. Gryffindor colours, he smiled to himself.\n\u201cRight, you can buy my present next,\u201d Grant grinned, tugging his sleeve, \u201cI want new socks, mine have all got holes.\u201d\nRemus took a big gulp of cold fresh air as they came outside, relieved. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get you something better than\nsocks,\n\u201d he said.\n\u201cCould do with some new Y-fronts too.\u201d Grant winked, and Remus blushed, looking down. He\u2019d get something really nice, later on, when Grant wasn\u2019t looking. He wasn\u2019t sure what, yet, and he didn\u2019t have a lot - but maybe a new coat might not stretch things too far? Grant was in dire need of one, his second-hand duffle barely kept the chill off.\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Grant asked, looking at a window display designed to look like the north pole, with big while pillows stacked up to look like igloos and gigantic stuffed toy penguins.\n\u201cChocolate.\u201d Remus shrugged.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I always get you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I want, now I don\u2019t smoke.\u201d\nGrant shook his head, tutting at Remus\u2019s temperance.\nSuddenly, Remus caught a whiff of magic. For a moment he wondered if his senses were just wrecked by all the perfume, but no, it was very clear. He looked up and down the street, curiously. Then he saw him, standing outside the Marks & Spencer\u2019s window display.\n\u201cChristopher? Is that you?\u201d Remus approached slowly.\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Christopher turned, surprised.\n\u201cWe have to stop meeting like this,\u201d Remus laughed. He was in a good mood, and at least he hadn\u2019t caught Chris in a compromising situation this time.\n\u201cYes, quite right,\u201d Christopher laughed too, a little nervously, clearing his throat at the end. He was carrying several bulging shopping bags, in both hands. \u201cHow are you? Sorry I haven\u2019t been in touch, it\u2019s been ever so busy at work.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s ok. I\u2019m well,\u201d Remus nodded. Christopher\u2019s eyes flicked towards Grant. Remus remembered his manners, \u201cSorry, er, this is Grant, my\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBetter half.\u201d Grant finished with a cheeky grin, holding out a gloved hand. Christopher looked as though he didn\u2019t know whether to laugh along too, but he shifted his shopping bags to shake Grant\u2019s hand,\n\u201cChristopher Barley,\u201d he said.\n\u201cChris and I were at school together,\u201d Remus explained.\n\u201cOh, I see,\u201d Grant nodded, eagerly, his eyes bulging. He never said anything about it, but Remus knew Grant was secretly dying to meet another wizard, just to compare. \u201cLive in London, do ya?\u201d\n\u201cEr, no. Just in for shopping, you know. Christmas.\u201d\n\u201cUs too,\u201d Remus said.\n\u201cHow nice.\u201d Chris said very formally. It was starting to get a bit weird - Remus felt like they were at a middle class cocktail party or something, exchanging pleasantries.\n\u201cChris dear? There you are!\u201d A short blonde woman came trotting up the street in neat black high heels and a gorgeous ermine coat. She was tugging a little boy along by the hand - he looked about five years old, and he had Christopher\u2019s eyes. \u201cCan we go quite soon? There are too many muggles about, it\u2019s suffocating.\u201d\nChristopher avoided Remus\u2019s gaze, and greeted the woman.\n\u201cSorry, dear, I was just\u2026 I bumped into an old Hogwarts friend.\u201d He gestured vaguely.\n\u201cHow lovely!\u201d She turned her red-lipped smile on Remus. She held out a tiny hand, and he shook it awkwardly, not sure if he was supposed to kiss it.\n\u201cDarling, this is Remus, and his friend Grant. Remus\u2026 this is \u00c5sa,\u201d Christopher mumbled, \u201cMy wife. And Henrik, my son.\u201d\n\u201cPleased to meet you,\u201d Remus nodded. Grant nodded too, but Remus could tell he was uncomfortable.\n\u201cIt is a pleasure!\u201d \u00c5sa gushed, \u201cI have to say, I don\u2019t meet so many of Christopher\u2019s school mates. You must come for dinner one evening, and tell me all about his mischiefs!\u201d\n\u201cHa, yeah, definitely,\u201d Remus laughed self-consciously, rubbing the back of his neck. He didn't even know what he was saying. Christopher was married?! He had a kid?!\n\u201cWell, we\u2019d better be going.\u201d Christopher said, his face weirdly blank. \u201cMerry Christmas, Remus.\u201d\n\u201cMerry Christmas\u2026\u201d Remus gave an awkward wave, as the family turned to walk away, towards Diagon Alley.\n\u201cIs it just me,\u201d Grant said, as they left, \u201cOr was that strange?\u201d\n\u201cVery.\u201d Remus said. \u201cHe must have met her in Sweden\u2026 He said his family sent him there\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t her that was strange.\u201d Grant said.\n\u201cNo, I mean\u2026\u201d Remus bit his lip, \u201cEr\u2026 so I know Chris from school, but I\u2019ve seen him since. About eighteen months ago, coming out of that sauna in Soho.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Grant said. \u201cRight, I get it. Poor bloke.\u201d\n\u201cHe never said anything then\u2026 he\u2026 how old did the kid look, to you?\u201d\n\u201cOlder than eighteen months.\u201d Grant shrugged.\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\nIt soon began to rain; icy cold December rain, so they ran for the next bus and went home. Remus often thought about Christopher, after that, and it troubled him. There was nothing much he thought he could do about it, and really it was none of his business - but he didn\u2019t understand at all. Had Christopher been convinced, or coerced? Did he love her, was he happy?\nBy the time he and Grant got in from the rain they were freezing and soaked through. They took a hot shower to warm up, then Remus lit a fire in the old floo connection to heat up the flat for Grant.\n\u201cHow does that work when we ain\u2019t got a chimney?\u201d Grant asked, bringing in the tea.\n\u201cMagic.\u201d Remus yawned, as Grant settled down beside him.\n\u201cI\u2019m like that bloke in Bewitched married to the sexy blonde.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t wiggle my nose though.\u201d\n\u201cAww, now I\u2019ll never leave you alone until you do,\u201d Grant grinned.\nRemus gave him a haughty look, and pointed his wand at the radio. They were so cosy, it felt wrong to switch the telly on.\n\"Thanks for coming with me, today.\" Grant said, wrapping his hands around his mug of tea to warm them, \"I know you hate crowds.\"\n\"I don't mind, really. Thanks for getting me out of the house. And showing me the lights.\"\n\"Any time,\" Grant snorted. \"Always cheers me up, Christmas shopping. Y'know, no one's thinking about themselves - just making other people happy - it's nice.\"\n\"I thought you were against the commercialisation of Christmas.\" Remus commented, wryly. Grant elbowed him,\n\"I\nam\n, but some of it's still nice. Anyway, thought you'd like a break from politics this weekend.\"\nRemus didn't respond, just kissed Grant's cheek, and settled in to listen to the radio. The tail end of a Suzanne Vega song was playing. \u201cLove this tune,\u201d Grant murmured, leaning against his shoulder, \u201cLove her voice, all clear and weird, you know what I mean?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a greek myth,\u201d Remus replied, drowsily, \u201cOdysseus.\u201d\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s something beginning with a C,\u201d Grant replied, sipping his tea.\n\u201cYes, Calypso - she\u2019s the siren, but Odysseus is the main character.\u201d\n\u201cSiren? Isn\u2019t that like a mermaid?\u201d\n\u201cSort of. They lure men in with their singing.\u201d\n\u201cAre they real?\u201d Grant asked. He always wanted to know.\n\u201cYes, mermaids are. I don\u2019t know if Calypso was.\u201d\n\u201cSo what did she do? They fell in love, or what?\u201d\n\u201cOdysseus\u2019s story is called The Odyssey. It\u2019s all about his journey home from the trojan war.\u201d Remus furrowed his brow, trying to remember. It was Homer - he'd read that in his second year, either before or after The Epic of Gilgamesh, he couldn't remember. He hadn't really liked The Odyssey - he'd preferred The Illiad, because that had all the good war stuff in it. Maybe he'd feel different now, as an adult.\n\u201cThe trojans... are they the ones with the wooden horse?\u201d Grant asked, still trying to follow the thread.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. Odysseus gets into all sorts of trouble as he tries to get home to his wife, Penelope. But the sea god gets angry with him about something - can't remember what, but he destroys Odysseus\u2019s ship, and he washes up on this island, where Calypso lives. She falls in love with him and holds him hostage for seven years.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does she do to him?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I dunno. Feeds him, heals his wounds and stuff. I think she dances a lot.\u201d\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t sound too bad. She sounds kind.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. But she wants to make him immortal, and Odysseus wants to get back to Penelope. Calypso isn\u2019t his true love.\u201d\n\u201cSort of sad.\u201d Grant huffed, sounding put out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a story.\u201d Remus shrugged."

Rachel Marlene.\n\n\n\u201cNot gonna lie,\u201d she told Remus over the phone, \u201cI\u2019m praying she\u2019s a squib. Can\u2019t be doing with all that nonsense.\u201d\n\n\nShe invited him to the Christening, and he went out of obligation. It had been decades since he\u2019d set foot in a church, and this was a huge catholic one in Croydon. Grant didn\u2019t come, said he was too scared he\u2019d burst into flames when he crossed the threshold.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Remus sighed, tired and humourless, \u201cMary is\n\n\nliterally\n\n\na witch. If she\u2019s safe in a church...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy grandad was a bible-basher,\u201d Grant shuddered, \u201cThey can all\n\n\ndo one\n\n\n, far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\n\n\nGrant was rarely so stubborn, so Remus went alone, and tried not to think about funerals.\n\n\nAfter the ceremony, there was a bit of a party in the hall next door, and Mary showed off the baby. She was gorgeous; chubby with huge brown eyes and huge brown curls and a gummy smile sure to be as dazzling as her mothers\u2019 one day. Remus waved at the giggling cherub nervously, and patted her soft baby hand.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m completely obsessed with her.\u201d Mary gushed, holding her up, \u201cWant to hold her?\u201d Mary grinned, then laughed that girlish cackle which took him back years, \u201cI\u2019m\n\n\nteasing\n\n\n, Remus darling. Here, I\u2019ll give her to Darren\u2019s mum for a bit, let\u2019s you and me have a catch up\u2026\u201d\n\n\nThey sat on red plastic chairs in a quiet corner of the church hall, clutching paper cups of watered down orange squash. It was a small space, filled with the noise of family celebration, and children playing. Mary\u2019s family was huge, and as brash and loveable as she was. Remus felt very out of place, but what else was new.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not getting married, then?\u201d Remus asked, \u201cYou and Darren?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShh, Mum\u2019ll hear you,\u201d Mary giggled, \u201cShe\u2019s furious, of course, she\u2019s pretending we had a small ceremony in Jamaica before Rachel was conceived. Nah, I don\u2019t fancy it - and we\u2019ve barely got the time what with the garage and the new house\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded along, smiling. It felt so good to be sitting next to Mary again; to have her chattering away, full of energy and joy.\n\n\n\u201cHow about you, still up Soho?\u201d Mary asked, giving him an appraising look. He\u2019d come dressed in a suit he had bought the day before from a charity shop. It was ok; a bit seventies, and too big on him, but that was the style these days anyway.\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He nodded, \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever move, to be honest, the flat\u2019s paid for.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGot a boyfriend?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm, sort of\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know you have, why are you being so mysterious? Is he a muggle?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I wish you\u2019d come and see me more often, Remus. I worry about you.\u201d\n\n\nHe smiled at her, \u201cYou\u2019re such a mum.\u201d\n\n\nThat made her laugh. \u201cGuilty!\u201d\n\n\nShe was still beautiful, and looked the same at thirty as she had at eighteen, in his mind. She wore a loud, hot pink dress suit with razor sharp power shoulders and a gleaming gold fascinator perched atop her head. She\u2019d cut her hair short, making her face look more angular, like a Nefertiti bust.\n\n\n\u201cMum keeps calling me \u2018Grace Jones\u2019,\u201d Mary touched her bare neck self-consciously, \u201cI like it, though. Can\u2019t waste time fussing in front of the mirror when I\u2019ve got the little monkey keeping me on my toes. Are you working somewhere?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 here and there,\u201d Remus shrugged, noncommittally. \u201cYou know what it\u2019s like.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know Dumbledore gave\n\n\nSnape\n\n\na job,\u201d Mary leaned in and whispered. Remus didn\u2019t know why - he was the only other person there who knew who Dumbledore or Snape were. \u201cHe\u2019s a teacher at Hogwarts, now. Can you believe that?!\u201d\n\n\nRemus shrugged. Mary continued, furious. This had obviously been on her mind for some time, \u201cWhen I think of all the suffering that snivelling coward caused! When I think about all the friends I\u2019ve lost\u2026 Lily and James, Peter... Marlene.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSnape wasn\u2019t responsible for their deaths.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow are we to know? So what, he turned spy for\n\n\ntwo bloody weeks\n\n\nat the end - and that guarantees him a cushy job for life, does it? What was he doing while we were hiding in cellars like rats? Where was he when we were disappearing by the day?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMary\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t believe Dumbledore. Has he offered\n\n\nyou\n\n\nany help? He hasn\u2019t me. Not worth his time, I suppose. They all stuck together in the end; the old families.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t\n\n\nwant\n\n\nanything from him.\u201d Remus said, \u201cBeing in Dumbledore\u2019s debt is too dangerous. Anyway. Snape has to live with what he did; just like we all do.\u201d\n\n\nShe lowered her eyes, then, and Remus knew they were both thinking about Sirius.\n\n\n\u201cI tell you what, Remus my love,\u201d She said, finally, \u201cI don\u2019t care if she\u2019s magic or not, my baby girl won\u2019t be cannon fodder for that old bastard. Next time that lot want a war, you and me are going to be smart enough to keep well out of it, eh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cToo right.\u201d Remus replied. They could agree on that, at least. He\u2019d join the werewolves again before he ever re-joined the Order.\n\n\n\u201cYou know, having Rachel makes me think about Harry.\u201d Mary said, wistfully. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got a child of my own, \u00a0just don\u2019t know how Lily and James did it. Remember? We were all just kids, playing mummies and daddies, weren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI s\u2019pose, yeah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be starting Hogwarts next year, Harry.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?! No, that\u2019s not right, he must only be\u2026\u201d Remus struggled to do the maths in his head. \u201cShit.\u201d He said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPoor little love, going to school with no parents to see him off.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh gosh, sorry, Remus! I wasn\u2019t thinking\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he chuckled, \u201cI\u2019ve got over being an orphan by now.\u201d\n\n\nHe stayed for about an hour before heading off to catch his bus in the cold dark of an early winter evening. He clutched two slices of cake wrapped in pink paper napkins -\n\n\none for you, one for your \u2018sort of\u2019 boyfriend,\n\n\nMary winked as she\u2019d handed them over.\n\n\nHe kissed her cheek, and she stretched up on her tiptoes to hug him. She smelled the same, and it made him want to cry.\n\n\n\u201cLove you, sweetheart,\u201d she whispered, \u201cI\u2019m so pleased to see you getting back to yourself.\u201d\n\n\nHe gave her a half-smile, congratulated her again, and left.\n\n\nShe was right. He was getting back to himself - or if not that, becoming somebody else; somebody who was coping. He\u2019d kicked fags and booze, he rarely spent afternoons staring at his bedroom ceiling, unable to get dressed. Sometimes weird things made him anxious, like the smell of motor oil, or when they played old Bowie songs on the radio. Once he\u2019d seen a teenage girl with ginger hair get off a bus in Finsbury Park and almost followed her home. But he was doing better.\n\n\nSometimes he could even think about Sirius. Sometimes he could talk about him - only to Grant, and only if he asked. Funny things, like pranks they\u2019d done at school, or stupid in-jokes. He didn\u2019t think about them being together - he turned Sirius into a different person in his mind, just another character from his school days. That made things much easier.\n\n\nAfter the Christening, on the way home, Remus thought about Harry. He hoped the kid was happy, or at least that he wasn\u2019t angry. Remus tried to picture himself, aged 11, crossing through the barrier at King\u2019s Cross for the first time. It had been nerve-wracking and exhilarating, and he hadn\u2019t known how to act, how to relate to anyone else. And then he\u2019d met James, the first friendly face on the train that day. It was too cruel that Harry wouldn\u2019t ever know him.\n\n\nRemus was in danger of getting nostalgic now, and weepy, so he got off the bus to walk the rest of the way home. He was tired by the time he got in, and his hip hurt, but that was ok; he felt good about having left the house.\n\n\n\u201cAll right, sunshine?\u201d Grant called from the kitchen as Remus shut the front door.\n\n\n\u201cHiya,\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow was it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cChurch bit was boring. Seeing Mary was nice.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh good,\u201d Grant came through to lean in the door frame. He was drying a dish they\u2019d used last night.\n\n\n\u201cLeave that, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Remus said, collapsing into the couch.\n\n\n\u201cNah, it's done.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMary invited us for dinner. They live out in Hounslow though, bit of a trek\u2026 but if you fancied it...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh she knows who I am now?\u201d Grant smirked.\n\n\n\u201cSort of.\u201d Remus blushed. \u201cshe knows I\u2019m seeing someone, just\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFor almost nine years, Remus\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry, it's just weird because\u2026 Mary knew me back then, you know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe knew you when you were with Sirius.\u201d Grant said flatly, turning back into the kitchen to put the plate away.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that!\u201d Remus said, getting up stiffly.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not being like anything.\u201d Grant\u2019s face was hidden by the cupboard door.\n\n\n\u201cI invited you to the Christening, you didn\u2019t want to come.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know bloody well why, too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou hate churches, I know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, then.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy are we fighting?!\u201d Remus frowned, confused.\n\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t fighting.\u201d Grant closed the door to the cupboard, sighing.\n\n\n\u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was ten years ago, that's all. You\u2019re still acting like I don\u2019t matter as much as he did.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?! No, that's mad, that's--\"\n\n\n\u201cThat's all I want to say.\u201d Grant raises a hand to stop him. \u201cLike I said, this isn\u2019t a fight.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut Grant, I don\u2019t\u2026 you\u2019re wrong, I swear! I want you to meet Mary, I do!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going for a walk, ok? I need some air.\u201d Grant pushed past him to the door. He took his coat off the hook - the coat Remus had bought him last Christmas. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in an hour or so. Take a paracetamol for your hip, will you? You\u2019re limping again.\u201d"

Remus had almost turned the living room upside down in his search. He stood in the middle of the mess, running his fingers anxiously through his hair.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a million exam sheets to mark today, I really need it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJust do it without magic, like the rest of us mortals,\u201d Grant shrugged, lifting the couch cushions to help him look.\n\u201cI can\u2019t, I\nreally\nneed my wand\u2026\u201d Remus huffed, looking under the TV table.\n\u201cShame there ain\u2019t a spell to find it, eh,\u201d Grant chuckled. Then he saw Remus\u2019s face, and turned serious, raising his hand, \u201cOk, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll find it\u2026 right, last time you used it\u2026 er\u2026 when the lights went, last night, remember?\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah!\u201d Remus rushed into the bedroom. They\u2019d been having power cuts at least twice a week for the past month - Remus thought that was all over now the miners were back to work, but apparently not.\nHis wand had rolled under the bed. He snatched it up, relieved, and held it tight in his fist. \u201cThank Merlin.\u201d He whispered to himself.\n\u201cGot it?\u201d Grant asked, as Remus returned to the living room. Grant was straightening out the mess Remus had left. Remus flicked his wand triumphantly, and the room re-ordered itself. Grant made a noise of surprise and delight. \u201cClever clogs.\u201d He grinned.\nRemus poked his tongue out, and went to organise his pile of papers.\n\u201cStill don\u2019t see why you need your wand - does it speed things up, or something?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I need it to read,\u201d Remus replied, sitting down at the little dining table to work.\n\u201cEh?\u201d\n\u201cI have this spell that helps me read,\u201d Remus said, \u201cI never learnt how to do it properly at St Edmund\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t\nread\n?!\u201d Grant hand his hands on his hips, staring at Remus in disbelief.\n\u201cWell, I can\na bit\n\u2026\u201d Remus said, feeling defensive, \u201cJust not very well - the words get all jumbled up, I dunno why.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Grant said, sitting down next to him. \u201cYou\u2019re dyslexic.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m what?\u201d Remus frowned at him. He\u2019d never heard that world before; it sounded like a spell.\n\u201cDyslexic. They used to call it word-blind. Nothing wrong with your IQ, it\u2019s the connection between your eyes and your brain or something\u2026 I read some about it when I was studying Education. Trying to get them to acknowledge it at work, I reckon a few of the boys need extra help, but the governor just reckons they\u2019re thick.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what they told me.\u201d Remus frowned. \u201c...wait, so it\u2019s a real thing?!\u201d\n\u201cOf course it is,\u201d Grant shrugged. \u201cBloody amazing you\u2019ve got a spell for it, show me!\u201d\nRemus did, but of course there wasn\u2019t very much to see, and he couldn\u2019t do it on Grant. He made a mental note to look up dyslexia when he had some free time - if he could figure out how on earth to spell the stupid word.\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to finish then,\u201d Grant said, \u201cRemember our plans tonight!\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026 yeah\u2026\u201d Remus sighed. \u201cWell, if I finish in time, maybe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d Grant shook his head firmly, \u201cWe\u2019re going, Remus Lupin. I\u2019m dragging you into the nineties kicking and screaming if I have to.\u201d\nRemus laughed half-heartedly, trying to ignore the gnawing dread in the pit of his stomach.\nIt was his thirty-first birthday tomorrow, and Grant had decided that this was the year Remus would finally go to his first gay bar. As March approached Remus just wanted to hide until the day was over, like always. Birthdays always reminded him of the marauders.\n\u201cYou ought to get out a bit,\u201d Grant kept saying, \u201cMeet some people.\u201d\n\u201cI hate people.\u201d Remus would reply acidly, \u201cPeople voted for Thatcher and keep buying Morrissey\u2019s records. People are idiots.\u201d\nGrant laughed,\n\u201cPeople are great. Art, sex, coffee, conversation - can\u2019t have any of those without people. People are what makes it all worthwhile and you know it.\u201d\nHe was right - Grant was generally right about humanity.\nAnd the world had certainly changed. Remus had missed out, as usual, immersed in the war, or locked up in his own grief. Grant returned to him from the outside world like an explorer with fantastical stories to tell.\nThings were different now, for people like them - queers, or, more appropriately these days; \u2018gay men\u2019. Just over two decades ago it had been a crime to live the way they did - and there had been plenty of bumps in the road since then, but you couldn\u2019t stop progress.\nAs the eighties drew to a close, it seemed gay people were everywhere; Grant made London sound like one massive coming out party. He told Remus about once seeing Freddie Mercury in Heaven, the Pet Shop Boys playing on the radio, Frankie Goes to Hollywood was number one again, Boy George\u2019s makeup - even\nElton John\nwas gay now.\nSo, Remus thought, it was probably time he at least try to get involved.\nThey went to a small bar, just around the corner, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready for Heaven, yet,\u201d Grant teased him.\nRemus wished he wouldn\u2019t make fun. He was more nervous than he expected to be.\n\u201cI won\u2019t fit in\u2026\u201d He said, checking his face in the little mirror by their front door. He was looking old.\nThirty-one.\nJesus Christ, only yesterday he\u2019d been seventeen.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gay bar.\u201d Grant tutted, standing behind him with an amused expression. \u201cYou\u2019re gay. You\u2019ll fit in.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno if I\u2019m\nthat kind\nof gay, though\u2026\u201d Remus replied, touselling his greying hair to see if that improved anything. Not really, just made him look a bit scruffier. \u201cWon\u2019t they all be\u2026 I dunno, younger, more fun?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re loads of fun.\u201d Grant said. Remus met his eyes in the mirror and raised an eyebrow. Grant snickered, \u201cWell,\nI\nthink you\u2019re fun. I\u2019m not gonna make you dance, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s stay in and get a Chinese!\u201d Remus pleaded, one last time.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Grant shook his head, smiling, \u201cYou promised me. One hour minimum, come on.\u201d\nSo he went. Maybe he was getting soft in his old age.\nRemus was right - the crowd in the little bar was younger and more fun. There were a few people older than him, though, which made him feel a bit less out of place, and at least all the coloured lights hid his grey hair.\nWhen Remus was a little boy at St Edmund\u2019s, the one TV show everyone had agreed on wanting to watch was Top of the Pops on Friday evenings. They\u2019d gathered around the tiny fuzzy black and white screen, and through the blizzard of static watched the trendy young people dancing along to their favourite pop songs. The St Edmund\u2019s lads were particular fans of Babs Lord, the bouncy blonde lead dancer of Pan\u2019s People, Top of the Pops\u2019 in-house dance troupe.\nThat studio had looked like the coolest place on earth to eight year old Remus, and he was instantly reminded of it as he followed Grant into \u2018Boyz\u2019. Except that devotees of busty Babs would have been very disappointed, because the clientele in here was decidedly male.\nOh my god\n, Remus thought to himself, as he walked through the busy dance floor to the bar,\nare they all gay?! Do they all know I\u2019m gay?! Oh my god...\n\u201cDo you wanna calm down there, sunshine?\u201d Grant gave him a look as they took up two barstools near the light-up dancefloor.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Remus said, his voice maybe a bit too high.\n\u201cStop staring, you weirdo! I\u2019ll get you a drink.\u201d\nBut Remus couldn\u2019t help staring. Everyone was just so\nbrazen\n, tight jeans, tight shirts - or no shirts at all, in some cases. They were dancing together, and laughing, and kissing, and it was all just fine - no one was saying anything about it. Remus\u2019s head was spinning.\nGrant handed Remus a drink - a cherry cola, because he still wasn\u2019t supposed to be drinking. Remus sipped it, and tried not to look as out of place as he felt. He didn\u2019t know any of the music, either, it was all too modern for him. God, he was old.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you said I didn\u2019t have to dance,\u201d he said to Grant, \u201cSeems like that\u2019s the only thing to do.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Grant smiled, \u201cRelax! That\u2019s the whole point of being here!\u201d\nRemus tried. He was glad it was not a busy night, he didn\u2019t think he'd be able to cope with a crowd. He sat on his stool and sipped his coke, and looked around without staring, and eventually it felt a bit less scary. He felt a bit twitchy when a drag queen sidled up to him - six foot ten in pink PVC platform boots and a Dolly Parton wig, but she fluttered her massive eyelashes at him and held out a cigarette,\n\u201cGot a light, handsome?\u201d\nRemus felt his cheeks burning, and shook his head shyly, \u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbled, \u201cDon\u2019t smoke.\u201d\n\u201cOi, do your trick though,\u201d Grant elbowed him. He addressed the drag queen, \u201cRemus \u2018ere does this \u2018mazing magic trick.\u201d\n\u201cWell I love a bit of magic,\u201d the glamorous stranger purred. Remus bit his lip, but nodded,\n\u201cOk, um\u2026\u201d he took the cigarette and put it between his own lips, then snapped his fingers. The end lit at once, and Remus took a quick drag, for his troubles, before handing it back.\n\u201cBlimey!\u201d The drag queen blinked, staring at the lit fag, \u201cAmazing is right! Better watch out for you, eh, magic man?\u201d\nRemus blushed again, looking down at his coke, \u201cJust a sleight of hand.\u201d\n\u201cCome here often, then?\u201d She leaned against the bar, smoking, her blood red lipstick staining the fag end.\n\u201cOh, no!\u201d Remus said, maybe a bit too quickly.\nGrant laughed and put a hand on his shoulder, \u201cIt\u2019s his first time. Brought him for his birthday.\u201d\n\u201cOh, happy birthday!\u201d She smiled broadly, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to play you a song, later - just go and tell the DJ, ok sweetie?\u201d\n\u201cEr, ok.\u201d Remus nodded, planning to do no such thing.\n\u201cSee you later, boys,\u201d the drag queen winked and sailed away across the dancefloor.\n\u201cWasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d Grant said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be ready to march with me in the pride parade by July.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that\u2026\u201d Remus laughed.\nHe gazed at the dancefloor a bit longer. The drag queen had treated him as if he\u2019d belonged. Rather than feeling more self conscious, he actually felt a bit happier - everyone was nice enough, no one was being nasty, or rude. He watched a couple kissing in the middle of the floor - they were really going for it, groping each other\u2019s backsides - and people were actually\ncheering.\nHe remembered his friends cheering when Mary and Sirius kissed in the Gryffindor common room, all those years ago - that had been Remus\u2019s birthday, too, and the date of Remus and Sirius\u2019s first kiss, which had happened in shadows. Almost all of their kisses had been hidden away, because deep down they both knew that no one wanted to see\nthat\n. Not in the seventies, not at Hogwarts.\nRemus had a sudden urge to do something similar, here, in plain view, where everyone could see and nobody would frown or jeer.\nOnly he wasn\u2019t\nquite\nbrave enough for public snogging just yet, even at the grand old age of (almost) thirty-one. So he just reached over and held Grant\u2019s hand, on top of the bar. Grant blinked in surprise, but then his face lit up so gorgeously that any last trace of nerves left Remus completely. He sometimes forgot that Grant had feelings too, which sounded heartless, but it was only because Grant so rarely complained. Happiness looked so good on him that Remus made a resolution to work harder on it.\nThey hung around a bit longer, until Remus had finished his drink. He had no desire to dance (though more than one person had approached, inviting him to join them) but the experience hadn\u2019t been dreadful. He said as much to Grant, who laughed,\n\u201cTold you so! Thanks for coming, darling, I know it\u2019s not easy.\u201d\n\u201cYou make it easier,\u201d Remus said, softly - surprising himself. Grant looked taken aback, and squeezed Remus\u2019s hand again,\n\u201cBloody charmer,\u201d he said, bashfully. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ve got a chocolate cake waiting in the fridge at home, you can blow out the candles and we\u2019ll kiss in the dark.\u201d\nRemus grinned back, \u201cSounds perfect.\u201d\nHe nipped to the loo before leaving. He could have waited until he got home, they were only around the corner, but he felt that this was his last test of bravery.\nThe toilets were unisex, which Remus supposed was fair enough, if a bit embarrassing - there weren\u2019t any girls about at least. He went and used a urinal, as quickly as possible, trying to ignore the sound and scent of sex emanating from the cubicles. He was just washing his hands when the door swung open, and somebody closed in behind him. He spun around, surprised, and faced the stranger.\n\u201cWhat--\u201d\nThe man grinned wide, showing his teeth. He licked his lips and sniffed the air, and then it hit Remus - the familiar scent, the instant connection - the lack of respect for personal space. A werewolf.\n\u201cI smelled your magic,\u201d the man said, his voice low, \u201c\nDelicious\n. Haven't seen\nyou\nbefore\u2026\u201d\nHe wasn't as tall as Remus, and he was quite thin, in a skin tight white shirt. He had long flame red hair, straight as a poker, and glacier blue eyes. The scent of earthy natural magic radiated off him in waves that made Remus giddy, blood rushing through his veins and arteries like an elixir.\n\u201cHi\u2026\u201d\nThe stranger sniffed again, \u201cWhich pack are you? You smell like Greyback\u2026\u201d\nRemus balked a bit at the idea he had anything of Greyback in him, but he shook his head, \u201cNo pack.\u201d\n\u201cBrave of you\u2026 Not worried you\u2019ll get rounded up by the Ministry?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you? Who are you with?\u201d For a moment Remus hoped he was one of Castor\u2019s - he desperately wanted to know how they were all doing, but the stranger just shrugged.\n\u201cOh, we drift here and there. You won\u2019t have heard of us.\u201d\n\u201cBut you know Greyback.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes.\u201d He pulled his shirt down at the collar, revealing an enormous bite mark which was all too familiar to Remus, \u201cWe go back a long way, he and I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe war, were you--\u201d\n\u201cHa, I was barely a pup, back then,\u201d the werewolf raised an eyebrow. His skin was so fair that his scars were like streaks of silver, pearlescent as moonbeams. \u201cBut the next war\u2026 the next war, we shall be ready for.\u201d\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be another war.\u201d Remus said. He was backed against the porcelain sink, the werewolf had placed a hand either side of him. He was trapped, but he\u2019d made no move to escape, not yet. \u201cVoldemort\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\u201cMmm, some say\u2026\u201d the werewolf smirked. He leaned in and licked behind Remus\u2019s earlobe. It made him shudder all over, he had to hold in a whimper. The other man pressed in on him, and whispered, \u201cBut I have heard that part of him lives still. The forests speak of ancient magic, of cursed blood\u2026 the dark lord gathers his strength\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Remus shook his head. He tried to push back, but only succeeded in grinding their bodies together. He knew it was all lies, and he knew this man was trouble, but\noh god\n, the scent was so heady, his body wouldn\u2019t listen to him; it only wanted one thing.\n\u201cCome,\u201d the werewolf kept whispering, his breath hot on Remus's neck, \u201cNo more talk of war, it\u2019s not our concern just yet\u2026 I want to enjoy you. Do you live nearby? We can go anywhere you like - this is going to be so good, the moon\u2019s waxing\u2026\u201d\nRemus shook his head again, as if he could rid himself of the fog of pheromones flooding his system, \u201cI'm here with someone.\u201d He rasped.\n\u201cBring them, if you like\u2026\u201d the wolf chuckled, \u201cI\u2019m all for sharing.\u201d\n\u201cN-no, I have to go\u2026\u201d Remus used his last shred of willpower to extricate himself from the stranger and hurry back into the bar, feeling the wolf's eyes blazing at his back.\nHe found Grant and grabbed his shirt sleeve, hissing, \u201cWe have to go home.\u201d\n\u201cEh? You all right, something happen?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026 um\u2026 I just want to go home. I want to take\nyou\nhome.\u201d He met Grant's eyes, still holding his arm, and he wondered if Grant could feel it too, feel the burning, the need. Sirius always could, but perhaps you had to be sensitive to magic? Remus focussed the intensity, projecting it outwards. Grant's eyes flickered and his pupils dilated, a warm blush creeping up his neck.\n\u201cAll right, then.\u201d He knocked back the last of his drink, and they left, running out onto the busy street together, hand in hand."

            "content": "I stumbled out of bed\n\n\n\n\nI got ready for the struggle.\n\n\n\n\nI smoked a cigarette\n\n\n\n\nAnd I tightened up my gut\n\n\n\n\nI said this can't be me; must be my double\n\n\n\n\nAnd I can't forget (I can't forget)\n\n\n\n\nI can't forget but I don't remember what.\n\n\n\n\n7th August 1993\n\n\nAn owl arrived that morning, and it was as if Remus had been waiting for it all along. He was brushing his teeth when the bird landed on his bathroom windowsill, brown and tawny. He recognised it at once \u2013 he would know a Hogwarts owl anywhere. It gave an official \u2018hoot\u2019 and stuck out its scaly leg. Remus untied the letter, toothbrush clenched between his teeth, mouth full of froth. He spat and opened the envelope as the bird took off again, navigating the narrow brick buildings with the perfect ease of a predator.\n\n\n\n\nMr R. J. Lupin,\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Dumbledore wishes to pay you a visit today at about tea time. He apologises for the short notice given, and hopes that he will be made welcome. No need to provide refreshments.\n\n\n\n\nHoping you are well.\n\n\n\n\nIt was not signed, and had presumably come directly from the headmaster\u2019s office. Remus expected his insides to turn cold, his hands to shake, tears to prick in his eyes. But nothing came; he felt no reaction other than extreme tiredness. Heaving a sigh, Remus finished brushing his teeth and dressed.\n\n\nGrant had left at some point for football practice - he\u2019d invited Remus; he always asked, but Remus never took him up on it. He\u2019d spent enough of his life watching people who were sportier than him doing sporty things.\n\n\nIt was a Saturday, and there was nothing much to do, so Remus read the paper \u2013 The Guardian; he hadn\u2019t picked up a copy of the Prophet in years \u2013 and settled in to wait.\n\n\nHe expected that \u2018tea time\u2019 was about 5pm, though you could never tell with Dumbledore. He tried to picture his old head teacher, wondering whether twelve years had made much difference \u2013 and to see if he was still angry. But no, Remus didn\u2019t think he had the energy for anger any more. Maybe he\u2019d used it all up.\n\n\nRestless, Remus switched on the telly, then turned it off again when there was nothing to watch but\n\n\nGrandstand\n\n\n. He found himself growing agitated. What sort of person simply announced their visit the morning of? What sort of person just invited themselves over? No one but Dumbledore. It was downright rude \u2013 what if Remus had had plans? He briefly wondered about teaching the old goat a lesson \u2013 walking out and going to see a film, let Dumbledore arrive to an empty flat. Serve him right.\n\n\nBut. But.\n\n\n\nRemus wanted to know. It had to be important; no one from Hogwarts or the Order had tried to get in touch since the early eighties. It could be anything.\n\n\nFinally that old familiar *CRACK* sounded just outside, and there was a soft but purposeful rap at the door. He opened it quickly, and found Dumbledore almost exactly as he\u2019d remembered. Hair a bit whiter, if that was even possible, but very much the same man. A queasy feeling rose up in Remus\u2019s throat, and he felt eleven years old again.\n\n\n\u201cProfessor.\u201d He said, dryly, standing aside to allow Dumbledore entry.\n\n\n\u201cRemus,\u201d the old man smiled, \u201cHow are you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Remus rubbed the back of his head, \u201cFine, yeah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLovely.\u201d Dumbledore\u2019s bright blue eyes darted about the room, taking in every inch of the home Remus had once shared with Sirius.\n\n\n\u201cSit, if you want.\u201d Remus offered.\n\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTea?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCertainly, very kind.\u201d\n\n\nRemus took the opportunity to escape to the kitchen. He made the tea the muggle way, with the electric kettle, just to stay away a bit longer.\n\n\n\u201cSugar?\u201d He called,\n\n\n\u201cThree, if you please.\u201d\n\n\nThe old man still had his sweet tooth then. Remus remembered the sherbet lemons with reluctant fondness. Tea made, he returned to the living room and set the mugs down on his battered old coffee table, using an old copy of\n\n\nPrivate Eye\n\n\nas a coaster.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been ages.\u201d Remus said, sitting in the armchair.\n\n\n\u201cTwelve years.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Remus flinched, irritated. Did Dumbledore really think he didn\u2019t count away each passing year? Each month?\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re keeping well?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell enough. I get by.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you know why I\u2019m here?\u201d The wizard asked. Remus shrugged,\n\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t the foggiest.\u201d\n\n\nDumbledore sighed very softly and set down his mug of tea. \u201cI was somewhat afraid of that. You haven\u2019t been reading the news, then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot your news, no. Why?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh dear, I had hoped you\u2019d already\u2026 you see, Remus\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Remus said suddenly, sharply. \u201cBlack. He\u2019s dead?\u201d\n\n\nDumbledore fixed him with a very intense stare.\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, gently, \u201cHe is not dead. Sirius has escaped.\u201d\n\n\nFor a moment, Remus thought he had misheard. Escaped. Would dead have been better? At least if Sirius was dead then it was all over, finally. He couldn\u2019t wrap his head around what \u2018escape\u2019 meant.\n\n\n\u201cChrist.\u201d He dropped his head into his hands.\n\n\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d Dumbledore sipped at his tea. Remus didn\u2019t trust himself to lift his mug, so he simply sat there, staring at the carpet. It needed hoovering badly. \u201cI take it, then,\u201d Dumbledore said, evenly, \u201cThat Mr Black has not been in touch?\u201d\n\n\nMr Black. He spoke as if they were still his students. Remus just shook his head mutely, looking up. Dumbledore nodded, and Remus knew he believed him.\n\n\n\u201cIs he\u2026 I didn\u2019t know anyone could escape Azkaban.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSirius would be the first.\u201d Dumbledore said. \u201cHe was always a very gifted wizard.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d Remus couldn\u2019t think properly, he felt as if a vault of long forgotten memories was easing open in his mind, its hinges rusty and sore. Could a dog escape the dementors? Could a dog swim to the shore? The north sea was so cold, he shuddered to think about it. Twelve years.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nHoney ahhhm home\n\n\n!\u201d Grant clattered through the door in fluorescent yellow football shorts with a terrible American accent and a cheesy grin, which froze when he saw Dumbledore, \u201cOh, sorry\u2026 tea party, is it?\u201d\n\n\nRemus stood up, anxiously, rubbing his arm, \u201cGrant, I\u2026 um\u2026 this is my old head teacher. Could you give us a minute?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you want,\u201d Grant furrowed his brow, eyes darting back and forth, \u201cShould I leave?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t go, just\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll wait in the other room.\u201d Grant said, understanding quickly.\n\n\nRemus blushed slightly, Dumbledore was sure to know that \u2018the other room\u2019 was the bedroom.\n\n\nGrant edged around the room awkwardly. Just as he reached the bedroom door, he patted his pockets, \u201cErr\u2026 Remus, got any fags?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nAccio Marlboro\u2019s\n\n\n,\u201d Remus said, with a twitch of his wand. The packet flew into his hand and he withdrew one of his own, lighting it with his wand, then threw the box to Grant, who caught it deftly.\n\n\n\u201cCheers,\u201d Grant nodded, retreating into the next room.\n\n\nRemus took a long drag, staring into space. His head swam; he very rarely smoked anymore. He hid a box for emergencies. And this was an enormous emergency.\n\n\n\u201cYou perform magic in front of this young man?\u201d Dumbledore asked.\n\n\nRemus gave him an irritated look. What a stupid thing to care about, \u201cYeah yeah, statute of secrecy,\u201d he replied, tutting, flicking his ash onto the coffee table, \u201cGive me detention for it if you like.\u201d He took another pull.\n\n\n\u201cFortunately, the statute of secrecy does not apply to partners, spouses or family members.\u201d Dumbledore replied, calmly, \u201cAnd I assume he is your\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus exhaled smoke, rubbing his head again, \u201cWell he\u2019s not my fucking brother, professor.\u201d\n\n\nDumbledore did not flinch.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Remus.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019ve had a shock. I hadn\u2019t realised that you\u2019d shut yourself off so much, I had thought\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo one to shut myself off from,\u201d Remus snorted, \u201cEveryone\u2019s gone anyway.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI wish I could give you some time to adjust to this news, but I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s another reason I\u2019ve come today.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course there is,\u201d Remus sighed, deeply. He just wanted Dumbledore to leave. He needed a drink, for the first time in years. He needed to drink himself into a stupor, to drown every thought in his head.\n\n\n\u201cAre you working, at the moment?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHere and there,\u201d Remus shrugged, \u201cWhat I can get.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere is a vacancy at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Remus snorted, \u201cFilch left, has he? Not interested.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is a teaching position.\u201d Dumbledore replied, once again demonstrating his uncanny ability to remain calm when confronted with barefaced cheek. Remus laughed rudely,\n\n\n\u201cHave you\n\n\nfinally\n\n\ncracked, Dumbledore?! You want to hire a werewolf to look after your kids, now?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere are measures we can take\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Remus shook his head, vehemently, \u201cYou\u2019re not getting me back in that bloody shack.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAdvances have been made, Remus,\u201d Dumbledore said, sharply, \u201cIf you had kept in touch with the wizarding world you would know this. The discovery of wolfsbane potion has been of enormous help to many with your condition. It would render you almost entirely harmless during your transformations. I would make it a condition of your employment.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy do you want me?\u201d Remus eyed him with renewed suspicion. What was he after? Teaching positions at Hogwarts were highly coveted, he knew that much.\n\n\n\u201cI think you would make an excellent teacher, first and foremost.\u201d Dumbledore said, \u201cI also thought you might appreciate the opportunity. And with the news of Black\u2019s escape, I\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Remus nodded, \u201cYou want me nearby. Just in case.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFor your own protection, of course.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t come after me.\u201d Remus said, stonily. \u201cHe might be mad, but he\u2019s not stupid. He\u2019s never been stupid.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot stupid, perhaps, but reckless.\u201d Dumbledore raised a snowy eyebrow.\n\n\nRemus conceded. True enough.\n\n\n\u201cWhat would I be teaching? History? Care of Magical Creatures?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDefence Against the Dark Arts,\u201d Dumbledore smiled pleasantly, now that Remus seemed to be coming around to the idea, \u201cAs an ex-member of the Order of the Phoenix, I thought you would be ideal.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm hm.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere is one other thing,\u201d Dumbledore said, sounding unsure for the first time, as though he wasn\u2019t certain what Remus\u2019s reaction might be. Remus said nothing, just looked him in the eye and waited. Dumbledore set down his mug. \u201cHarry.\u201d\n\n\nPain flared somewhere deep inside Remus, like the reopening of an old wound. His mouth went dry again, and he sipped his lukewarm tea.\n\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought.\u201d He said, quietly. \u201cI hadn\u2019t forgotten, but I \u2026 he\u2019d be\u2026 twelve?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThirteen, now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThirteen.\u201d He shook his head, slowly. \u201cIs he\u2026 what\u2019s he like?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe looks like James.\u201d Dumbledore said, sadly, \u201cBut there is a good deal of Lily in him too.\u201d\n\n\nRemus was quiet for almost a full minute, getting his breathing under control. Finally, he raised his head,\n\n\n\u201cOk.\u201d He said.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n1st September 1993\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going, then.\u201d Grant said.\n\n\nThis was a redundant statement. Remus was literally packing his bags. He was getting the strangest sense of dejas vu. How long had it been since he last packed a trunk for Hogwarts? He\u2019d had to dig out all of his old robes, his weird wizard clothes. They were shabby and threadbare, but he wasn\u2019t willing to fork out for new stuff, so he did his best with some mending spells. Grant had painted \u00a0\u2018Professor R J Lupin\u2019 on his old briefcase as a joke, but it didn\u2019t feel very funny at that moment.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d He confirmed, rolling up a pair of socks.\n\n\nGrant sat on the bed, watching him, stony faced. Remus didn\u2019t blame him. He was being unspeakably cruel, he knew that. And Grant was putting up with it, yet again. Remus looked at him. \u201cIt\u2019s a job. It\u2019s only for a year.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAt your old school.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve told you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know you are.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf Sirius has escaped, and he knows you\u2019re there, will he--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan we not? I\u2019m going, and that\u2019s it.\u201d Remus snapped, clicking his suitcase shut fiercely. He didn\u2019t want to think about that. He just needed to get through today.\n\n\nThey were silent for a bit, then. Grant went and made tea, brought it back in. Remus stopped to sit and drink it with him. He\u2019d given up smoking - for good this time, or so he told himself. Tea would have to do.\n\n\n\u201cYou can still stay here, I\u2019m not kicking you out.\u201d Remus said. \u201cThis place is just as much yours as it is mine, and there are protection spells, I made sure.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d Grant shrugged, giving a defeated smile. \u201cI\u2019m rubbish on my own. Probably do the rounds, or board at the Borstal. Been a while since I\u2019ve seen the Brighton lot, maybe I\u2019ll pop down.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStay in touch, ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not about to cart an owl around with me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 s\u2019pose not. I\u2019ll try to get to a phone, if I can.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGod, you make it sound like you\u2019re off to war.\u201d\n\n\nRemus swallowed, dryly, and found he couldn\u2019t speak. Fortunately, Grant didn\u2019t have speaking in mind, just then. He took Remus\u2019s tea from him, set it down on the bedside table, then turned around to push Remus down into the mattress.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you,\u201d he smiled against Remus\u2019s lips, working the button on his trousers. Remus kissed him back, as hard he had when they were teenagers.\n\n\nAfterwards, Remus decided it was best to leave quickly. He wanted to think about Grant lying happy and flushed under the duvet; an enduring memory of youth and beauty. He dressed, and picked up his bags.\n\n\nJust as he was about to say goodbye again, Grant grabbed his wrist. \u201cOi. I love you, you tosser.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGrant\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d Grant looked at him, directly. His face just as honest and sunny as it had been at sixteen. \u201cSay it back.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\n\n\nknow\n\n\nhow I feel about you\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Grant smiled, without a trace of bitterness, \u201cI do. But it\u2019d be nice to hear it. Go on, I know you can.\u201d\n\n\nTerror gripped Remus\u2019s heart - but he swallowed it. He had to be brave; Grant deserved it. And he meant it; he did,\n\n\nhe did\n\n\n. \u201c...I love you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCheers.\u201d Grant let go of his wrist, and that was all.\n\n\n\u201cWe will see each other again,\u201d Remus said, forcefully - promising it to himself as much as anything. Grant stretched out sleepily and nodded,\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d He sighed, \u201cLike magnets, you and me. Always snap back together again.\u201d\n\n\nRemus hurried out of the door, not wanting to get too upset. He had a train to catch."

For the first time in a very long time, Remus was lost; untethered, drifting. He wandered around the flat like a ghost, going through the movements of everyday life, but feeling nothing.\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t depression. He knew what depression felt like.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shock,\u201d said Grant.\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d said Remus, staring blankly at the TV.\n\n\nObviously he\u2019d expected Hogwarts to stir up old memories. He\u2019d known from the start that re-visiting the place could easily ruin him, but he'd done it anyway. Maybe he was a masochist. Maybe just stupid.\n\n\nThe castle was filled with ghosts from Remus\u2019s past, which was a deeply unsettling experience after spending the better part of a decade trying to forget all of it. The moment he arrived at King\u2019s Cross it all came flooding back - the pokey little train carriages with the worn-out upholstery; the trolley witch, chocolate frogs, the bustle and noise of students embarking on a new term. With the full moon ahead of him, he\u2019d squirrelled away in a compartment and promptly fallen asleep.\n\n\n\nUntil the carriage turned cold, and the dementors...\n\n\n\nNo. Anyway; ghosts. McGonagall was perhaps the strangest. She must have known he would be coming, but their first meeting had hit Remus harder than expected, and she\u2019d seemed just as surprised as him. They weren\u2019t quite sure how to relate to each other, now.\n\n\n\u201cMr Lupin! Oh - I\u2019m sorry,\n\n\nProfessor\n\n\nLupin.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHello Prof-- I mean\u2026 er\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMinerva, please,\u201d she smiled gracefully.\n\n\nShe reached out and squeezed his arm. She was every bit as formidable as she had been twenty years ago, only a little greyer at the temples. But then, so was he. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see you, Remus.\u201d She said, earnestly.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be back,\u201d he lied.\n\n\nHer eyes were soft and kind, as if she could see right through him.\n\n\n\u201cMy office is always open, if you need anything. As ever.\u201d\n\n\nHe appreciated the gesture, but didn\u2019t prevail upon her very often, largely because he wanted to keep to himself. He also wanted to stay away from Gryffindor tower, if he could.\n\n\nThe rest of the school was familiar; the lush expansive grounds, the secretive forest, the food, the portraits, the staircases he had mapped so carefully. But Gryffindor Tower - \u00a0the most intimate and happy space of his adolescence; that would be almost too much to recover from. He was put in mind of Homer, once again - the word \u2018nostalgia\u2019, which meant a painful homecoming. That was exactly how it felt.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t socialise much with his peers. The staff knew, by and large, about his lycanthropy, but he still prefered to avoid any unpleasant conversations, if he could. Were they tutting, behind his back? Were they wondering about him?\n\n\nNo one\u2019s seen him for years, he was Black and Potter\u2019s closest friend - what does he know? What did he do?\n\n\n\nFunnily enough, Professor Binns had forgotten Remus, but at least Flitwick hadn\u2019t. He was very kind, inviting Remus him to stop by the Charms classroom for tea and toast a few times. Remus did, to be polite, but found it difficult to forget all the times he and Sirius had locked themselves inside the kindly professor\u2019s classroom. He generally found it very hard to reconcile his adult self, responsible for lesson plans and marking essays and the welfare of students - with his reckless teenage self, wild and arrogant and madly in love.\n\n\nThere were entire wings of the castle he actively avoided, for this very reason. He barely left his classroom and chambers except for meals in the Great Hall, and he never went to Hogsmeade, except to quickly pass through on the way to the old phone box just outside the village. And thank god that was still there.\n\n\n\u201cHow is it?\u201d Grant asked, the first time Remus called.\n\n\n\u201cAwful. Bearable. I s\u2019pose like teaching, the kids are ok. Actually the kids are great.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell. Just focus on that. First time I went into a remand home after St Edmund\u2019s I thought I was gonna have to quit. I swear those places all smell the same. Anyway, you can get past it, if you remember it's about the kids, not you. Be the teacher you wish you\u2019d had.\u201d\n\n\nThis was good advice, and Remus did his very best. He hadn\u2019t had much experience with young people, but he very clearly remembered being a young person himself. He tried to organise lessons he would have found interesting, bringing in magical creatures whenever he could, like Ferox had, and giving extra tips and pointers wherever students were struggling. Really it wasn\u2019t too different from the study sessions he\u2019d held back when he was at school.\n\n\nEqually, Remus tried to pay attention to all of his students, and learn their characters, their individual needs. That was incredibly weird at first - he found he had no less than\n\n\nfive\n\n\nWeasleys to teach, one in almost every year. Then there was poor little Neville Longbottom, awkward and nervous and twitchy. Narcissa\u2019s son was in another class, the spitting image of Lucius,\n\n\nand then, of course, there was\u2026\n\n\n\nAnyway. Aside from Flitwick and McGonagall, the rest of the staff were virtual strangers to Remus - except, of course, for the Potions master.\n\n\nRemus had really wanted to stay out of Snape\u2019s way, but from the very first day it was clear that would not be easy. It was a full moon, and of course Snape was the only one who knew how to brew Wolfsbane Potion, the prick. He probably learnt how to do it just to torment Remus. It was bad enough they had to share a castle again, but Snape was hellbent on making sure Remus felt his displeasure at the arrangement.\n\n\n\u201cLupin.\u201d He said, haughtily, at their first meeting, just before the welcome feast. \u201cI was surprised to hear you survived the war.\u201d His lips curled, \u201cWhen it seems so many of your friends did not.\u201d\n\n\nAs foul as Snape was, it did bring out something Remus hadn\u2019t properly felt in years. Mischief.\n\n\n\u201cSeverus,\u201d he smiled, warmly, \u201cAnd I was surprised to hear you survived the trials. When so many of\n\n\nyour\n\n\nfriends did not.\u201d\n\n\nSnape sneered, and that set the tone for the year.\n\n\nSeverus had clearly not forgotten the events of their fifth year. He was as despicable as Remus remembered him, and had not aged well. His hair still hung lank and greasy, perhaps a little further back than before, his black eyes were more sunken, and his nose more beak-like. He made Remus\u2019s skin crawl, but there was nothing to be done about it; they had to meet privately each month for the potion.\n\n\nThe potion itself was utterly vile, and Remus resented it bitterly. It tasted awful, but worse than that was the effect it had.\n\n\nHe still transformed, still suffered the agonies as his skull elongated and his back split open and his tendons creaked - but he fully retained his human mind afterwards. This was utterly horrible. Remus had come to see the monthly retreat into his animal brain as something of a catharsis. But having an animal body and human thoughts turned out to be very unpleasant indeed; he felt neither here nor there, trapped in the wrong form and unable to escape. He curled up to sleep locked inside his office every month full of self-loathing.\n\n\nIn the mornings after he would limp to Madam Pomfrey\u2019s office to ask for murtlap essence. Of everyone from Remus\u2019s childhood, Madam Pomfrey seemed the most pleased to see him again. She had aged, like everyone else, but had retained her gentle touch, her sweet face and her no-nonsense attitude to Remus\u2019s wellbeing.\n\n\n\u201cRemus!\u201d She reached up to hug him the very first moment she saw him. \u201cJust look at you, you giant of a man!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHello, Madam-- er\u2026 Poppy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAs polite as ever,\u201d she smiled, \u201cCome on, come and tell me what you\u2019ve been doing with yourself.\u201d\n\n\nThey had a few very pleasant catch ups in her office, by the fireplace. She wanted to know everything about his transformations since Hogwarts, and he told her as much as he could. She was very interested to hear about the pack, and how they were able to heal each other by sharing group magic.\n\n\n\u201cI tried to get in touch with you, after the Potters died.\u201d She said, sadly, \u201cBut no one could tell me where you were living, and I didn\u2019t dare ask too much in case\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus looked away, embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He said, \u201cI wanted to be left alone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, well you were the same as a boy, stubborn!\u201d she smiled fondly. He smiled back, realising how much he had missed her.\n\n\nFor the first month or so, Remus\u2019s nerves were raw, he hesitated as he turned every corner, worried that he might see something painful. But, as pain often does, this lessened over time.\n\n\nHe slipped into a new character - not the teenage Remus who took risks without thinking, who was desperate to prove himself, and not the half muggle, half broken man he had been in London. Somewhere between these warring halves, he became Professor Lupin; restrained and serious, offering encouragement wherever he could.\n\n\nAnd this was all just as well, because that was exactly who he needed to be, for Harry.\n\n\n\nGod, Harry.\n\n\n\nHarry Potter was James and Lily seamlessly combined; all charm and cheek and strength and goodness. Remus had been worried - knowing that the kid\u2019s childhood had been far from ideal - that Harry would be difficult. Remus well remembered his own spiky temperament at thirteen; cruel adults make bitter children. But no. Harry was as kind-hearted and open minded as his parents - full of love and so, so generous with it. Getting to know him had been painful and joyful all at once.\n\n\nThe first time they met, Remus had thought he was still dreaming. He woke up on the train, clawed awake by dementors - those fucking abominations. He cleared the threat, and staring around at the faces of the frightened kids, found Harry, passed out on the floor. Until he opened his eyes he was James; nothing could convince Remus otherwise. A bit skinnier, maybe shorter than Prongs had been at thirteen, but otherwise the spitting image.\n\n\nOf course, Harry had no idea who Remus was, and for as long as possible, it stayed that way. How would he explain? Even after a few conversations with the boy, Remus was completely at sea. So he let Harry lead the way, and answered the questions which had suitable answers. When Harry came to him asking for patronus lessons so that he could keep playing quidditch, Remus couldn\u2019t say no. It was exactly what James would do, too.\n\n\nAnd when Sirius came up, he sidestepped it. Harry already knew that Black and James had been friends, and Remus wasn\u2019t sure what more he could say without losing the kid\u2019s trust.\n\n\n\u201cYes, Harry, your dad was my best friend, but Sirius Black was my everything\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nNo, it wouldn\u2019t do. What was more, Remus wasn\u2019t sure whether the wizarding world had its own version of Section 28 - if he started confessing to stuff like that, could he get in trouble for corrupting young minds? It was bad enough he was a werewolf.\n\n\nBy that time it was already clear that Sirius was nearby. When the convict broke into the castle on Halloween night, Remus almost walked straight off the grounds and apparated back to London. Maybe he would have, if the perimeter wasn\u2019t swarming with dementors - and of course the fact that Black was definitely after Harry.\n\n\nThat made Remus furious; hadn\u2019t Sirius done enough damage? He must have really lost his mind, he must have strayed so far from the young man who had cradled baby Harry in his arms with tenderness and awe. Remus used this as a reminder, to steel himself: it was no use mourning Sirius.\n\n\nHis\n\n\nSirius had died many years ago.\n\n\n\nAnd then that night happened. In a matter of hours everything changed...\n\n\n\n\nFuck.\n\n\n\nMaybe Grant was right, maybe it was shock. After being given his marching orders from Hogwarts (thank god; another year might have killed him), Remus took the Knight Bus back to London, his mind churning over everything he had learnt.\n\n\nEvents kept shifting and re-ordering themselves. Some things became clearer, others muddied by various versions of the truth. The things Sirius had said, the excuses Wormtail had snivelled, and everything Remus had thought he\u2019d known - none of these accounts lined up quite right.\n\n\nThe only thing Remus was certain of, was that for twelve years he had hated the wrong person.\n\n\n\u201cPlease come back,\u201d he wailed down the phone to Grant, once he was home. \u201cPlease, please\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOn my way.\u201d Grant said, and hung up immediately.\n\n\nIt still took hours. Remus changed into his muggle clothes, throwing Professor Lupin\u2019s shabby robes in a corner of the bathroom, and paced the flat while he waited, cursing the slowness of muggle transport. He didn\u2019t drink. He wanted a clear head; he wanted to\n\n\nunderstand\n\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cRemus?!\u201d Grant burst into the living room, tired and dishevelled. He\u2019d had a hair cut in the past year; it was so short it barely curled any more. Remus hated it, but said nothing, just ran to hug him. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Grant asked, huffing as Remus knocked the air out of him, but squeezing him back reassuringly.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t look the same, but he smelled the same, and that helped; that was very grounding.\n\n\n\u201cHe was innocent!\u201d Remus babbled, still clinging on, \u201cIt was Peter all along! It was never him! I was such an idiot!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, please\u2026 let\u2019s sit down, shall we? Christ, you\u2019re skinny, don\u2019t they feed you at that school?!\u201d\n\n\nRemus allowed Grant to take over. He sat obediently on the couch, accepted a glass of water, and a cigarette, because apparently Grant was smoking again, and the temptation was too much. The flat felt bare and stuffy, having sat empty for most of the year, and Grant opened the living room window, letting in the everyday sounds of foot traffic and pigeons.\n\n\n\u201cOk,\u201d Grant said, sitting opposite Remus, clasping his hands together in a very teacher-ly sort of way, \u201cLet\u2019s start at the beginning, shall we?\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded. He was determined to speak. If anyone could sort all of this out, it was Grant. He was sure of that. \u201cSirius.\u201d He said. \u201cI saw Sirius. And Peter.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d Grant frowned, \u201cPeter? I thought he\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus said, darkly, his insides turning hot with rage, \u201cHe\u2019s alive. He\u2019s been hiding, all these years.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFrom Sirius?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFrom everyone.\n\n\nHe did it\n\n\n. He betrayed James and Lily; it was never Sirius.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow... \u201c Grant shook his head, clearly confused, \u201cSo he was in prison all this time for something Peter did? Jesus. Ok. You\u2019re sure? He\u2019s the one who told you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, but I\u2026 I know for sure. I saw Peter, and I\u2026\u201d Remus faltered. \u201cI just believe Sirius, ok?\u201d\n\n\nThe fact was that he had read Sirius\u2019s mind, and he was still trying to get his head around that. He tried to piece the events of the night together, for Grant\u2019s benefit and his own. \u201cIt was all Harry - James\u2019s son. He left the school one night, and I knew why, so I followed him - I was worried Sirius would try to\u2026 but then Peter was there, I\n\n\nsaw\n\n\nPeter, and I didn\u2019t know what to think.\u201d\n\n\nSomething deep inside him had known at once; the second he saw Wormtail\u2019s name appear on the map. But he\u2019d had to find out, had to know for sure. And then he\u2019d got to the shack, and there was Sirius, skin and bones and rags and madness, cackling on the floor, Harry standing over him, poised with his wand.\n\n\nThe wolf part of Remus took over, recognising that Padfoot was in danger, and he disarmed everyone at once. \u201c\n\n\nWhere is he, Sirius?!\u201d\n\n\n\nThen he saw the rat, and it all fell into place. His mind went rushing back to 1981; all the secrecy, the mistrust, the lies. He looked at Sirius properly, he widened his eyes, and - almost without trying - he entered Sirius\u2019s thoughts.\n\n\nShow me\n\n\nhe commanded, using the same magic the werewolves used - Sirius\u2019s brain was half-canine by that point, and maybe that\u2019s why it worked. Black resisted for a moment, no doubt recalling Walpurga\u2019s forced intrusions, but he nodded, and he let Remus in.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut Padfoot,\u201d\n\n\nJames\u2019s voice, echoing from a distant past,\n\n\n\u201cI thought we were agreed?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI know, but this is better, can\u2019t you see?! No one will ever suspect Wormy!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLike a double bluff!\u201d\n\n\nLily chimed in.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s brilliant!\u201d\n\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t need to hear any more. He lowered the wands, and helped Sirius up, and embraced him tightly.\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry,\n\n\nhe communicated wordlessly,\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\n\n\n\nBack in the flat, tears pricked in Remus\u2019s eyes, and Grant pulled out a hanky, handing it to him. \u201cSo is he free, now? Sirius?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Remus shook his head, collecting himself, \u201cIt all got so complicated, and I\u2026 it was a full moon. I only saw him for twenty minutes, maybe, and then I turned, and\u2026 so much happened without me. Peter ran away, they didn\u2019t catch him. I should have killed him when I had the chance! I wanted to, I was going to, but Harry stopped me.\u201d\n\n\nGrant paled, his mouth a grim line. He didn\u2019t say anything, though.\n\n\n\u201cBy the time it was morning, Sirius had escaped again too.\u201d Remus continued. \u201cHe\u2019s in hiding, and I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\n\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever see him again.\n\n\n\nHe wiped his eyes, and ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cFuck! All this time! All this time and I believed it! How could I have been so stupid?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHey, stop it.\u201d Grant frowned, reaching out. Remus stood up abruptly, ignoring Grant and pacing the room once more, muttering to himself,\n\n\n\u201cI should have\n\n\nknown\n\n\nhe would never hurt James! I shouldn\u2019t have been so bloody gullible! So weak! I should have tried to see him, I could have got him out of there, I could have tracked down Peter, I could have\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Grant raised his voice, \u201c\n\n\nStop it\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nRemus looked at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d He said.\n\n\nGrant sighed. \u201cMe neither, mate.\u201d He rubbed a hand over his face, and Remus saw the rings under his eyes. Grant stood up. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing you can do right this second, so. I\u2019m going to have a shower, right? Then we\u2019ll get dinner. Then we\u2019ll talk a bit more.\u201d\n\n\nRemus nodded, eagerly. Yes, this was what he needed; a plan. Clear, defined next steps. Grant left the room, wearily. Remus waited, listening to the water running, trying once again to get his thoughts in order. He did something he hadn\u2019t done since he was a teenager. He made a list.\n\n\n\nSo, Moony\n\n\n, he said to himself,\n\n\nwhat are the facts?\n\n\n\nSirius Black did not murder James and Lily Potter.\n\nPeter Pettigrew was alive.\n\nPeter Pettigrew had been a spy.\n\nPeter Pettigrew murdered James and Lily Potter.\n\nSirius Black had been in prison for twelve years for a crime he was innocent of.\n\n\nA surge of anger washed over him once more. He had believed it! He was as guilty as Dumbledore, as anyone else who had simply assumed Sirius was the spy, because Sirius was a Black. In fact, Remus was even\n\n\nmore\n\n\nat fault, because\n\n\nhe\n\n\nought to have known! No one was closer to Sirius than he was.\n\n\nThose last few months of the war were such a blur. Hadn\u2019t there been something wrong? Hadn\u2019t Sirius been distant, cold with him? In the years since, Remus had taken that as proof of Padfoot\u2019s betrayal, but now\u2026 now with a sick feeling, he saw it for what it was.\n\n\n\u201cHe thought I was the spy!\u201d He said to Grant, the second he was out of the bathroom.\n\n\n\u201cEh?\u201d Grant frowned, trying to get past Remus, wrapped in a towel. \u201cSpy? What? Oi, let me get dressed, come on\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus followed him into the bedroom and sat on the bed, talking fast as Grant dried himself and put on clean clothes.\n\n\n\u201cDuring the war, we knew there was a spy, we knew someone was passing information to the other side, but no one knew who. Afterwards, we thought it was Sirius - it all made sense, he was caught blowing up a street full of muggles, and--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you have to call normal people that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry. Anyway - Sirius was the secret keeper for James and Lily - err\u2026 that means he had this spell on him, so only he knew where they were. To keep them safe. But he switched with Peter, at the last minute, and now we know that\n\n\nPeter\n\n\nwas the spy. And they didn\u2019t tell me about the switch, Sirius didn\u2019t tell me, because he must have thought\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe didn't trust you.\u201d Grant said, bluntly. Dressed, he sat down on the bed too, at a distance from Remus.\n\n\n\u201cI suppose I can\u2019t blame him\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHad you broken his trust before?\u201d Grant raised an eyebrow.\n\n\n\u201c...No.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDid\n\n\nyou\n\n\nthink\n\n\nhe\n\n\nwas the spy? Before James and Lily died?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, never!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell then.\u201d Grant stood up. \u201cI\u2019m going to nip to the shop - we need milk and bread\u2026 toothpaste\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWait, no, what do you mean \u2018well then\u2019?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNothing. Look, come on, come to the shop with me. Then I promise we can talk about it. I\u2019ll listen to you all night long if you want, I swear. I just want to get some food in you first.\u201d\n\n\nRemus went along with that. He watched Grant cook, and he swallowed every mouthful, and then he talked and he talked and he talked. But it was no good. It came to nothing in the end.\n\n\n\u201cIf Sirius is in hiding, and Peter\u2019s on the run\u2026\u201d Grant said, yawning.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll go straight to Voldemort, the rat.\u201d Remus growled.\n\n\n\u201cRight, ok,\u201d Grant waved a hand, \u201cIf Sirius is in hiding, then you can\u2019t do anything. It sounds like it\u2019s out of your hands.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe I could send an owl\u2026 only that might give away his location\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd then\n\n\nyou\u2019ll\n\n\nget arrested and sent to Alcatraz, or whatever it is, for colluding with a criminal.\u201d Grant said, with an air of finality.\n\n\n\u201cI just want to help him.\u201d Remus said.\n\n\n\u201cOf course you do. But I don\u2019t see how.\u201d\n\n\nThey sat in silence for a while, thinking. It was dark outside, Remus didn\u2019t know what time it was, but it had to be pretty late. Grant looked exhausted, and Remus felt a small twinge of guilt, on top of everything else.\n\n\n\u201cSorry to put you through this.\u201d He said, quietly, reaching for Grant\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not really fair of me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Grant gave him a small smile, stroking Remus\u2019s knuckles with his thumb, \u201cI do understand. It\u2019s just\u2026 a lot.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow\u2026 how was it, seeing him? I mean, how did it make you feel?\u201d\n\n\nRemus shifted, awkwardly. There it was. The thought he\u2019d been avoiding. Because if Sirius was innocent, if he\u2019d never betrayed James, then he\u2019d never betrayed Remus, either. And Remus didn\u2019t know what that meant to him, now, after so much time.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re both so different, now.\u201d He said, aware Grant was holding his breath while he waited for the response. \u201cI barely recognised him, really, I just felt sorry for him.\u201d The flutter in his stomach told him he was lying.\n\n\nGrant leaned over and kissed him. \u201cEverything will be all right, in the end.\u201d He said."

They\u2019d been watching telly, with all the windows open to counteract the summer heat. Remus had just been about to put the kettle on.\n\n\nThe bird sat on top of their boxy little TV and opened its beak, speaking in Dumbledore\u2019s voice;\n\n\n\u201cPadfoot is on his way.\u201d\n\n\nRemus nearly dropped the empty mugs he was holding.\n\n\n\u201cFuck.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Grant said, watching the bird vanish into thin air. \u201cWho\u2019s Padfoot?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFuck.\u201d Remus said again, setting down the mugs. He had begun to shake uncontrollably. He felt cold all over. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can. I don\u2019t think I can\u2026\u201d he mumbled to himself, covering his mouth.\n\n\n\u201cRemus?\u201d Grant stood up and touched his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re scaring me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSirius.\u201d He spluttered. \u201c\n\n\nSirius\n\n\nis Padfoot.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBloody hell. The murderer?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot a murderer, I told you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight, right, sorry. Coming\n\n\nhere\n\n\n?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s his flat, after all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I forgot.\u201d Grant said, flatly. He bit his lip, \u201cShould I... go?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Remus clung to Grant, suddenly, \u201cNo, please,\n\n\nplease\n\n\ndon\u2019t. I can\u2019t be alone, don\u2019t leave me alone with--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk, ok!\u201d Grant soothed him, hugging him back, \u201cCalm down, all right? I won\u2019t go anywhere if you don\u2019t want. Just\u2026 just try to get yourself together.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Remus took a deep breath.\n\n\nHe knew he was acting childishly. This was no time to fall apart. He\u2019d had years and years of that. If Dumbledore was sending Sirius to him, then something had happened. Something important. Now was the time for strength and action. He gazed around blindly for something to do.\n\n\n\u201cThis place is a mess! I should start cleaning. He won\u2019t be long.\u201d\n\n\nGrant was helpless to do anything but watch as Remus ran around the flat like a headless chicken, using every cleaning charm he could remember, combined with some actual manual labour when he mucked up the spells. He couldn\u2019t stop moving, he couldn\u2019t bear to sit still for a moment, because then he might have to\n\n\nthink\n\n\n.\n\n\nWithin the hour, there was a scratching noise at the door, and a low, gruff bark. Remus froze. A scent he had not known in many years reared something in his subconscious.\n\n\n\u201cWas that a dog?\u201d Grant said, nervously, from the kitchen. \u201cYou\n\n\nknow\n\n\nI hate dogs\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d Remus breathed. He walked shakily to the door, and pulled it open. There was Padfoot - scrawny, mangy, fur slightly greying in places. But it was him.\n\n\n\u201cCome in,\u201d Remus said, hoarsely.\n\n\nThe dog huffed, bobbing its head, and entered. Remus clicked the door shut, and leaned against it, watching as Sirius transformed back into himself.\n\n\nScrawny, mangy; greying in places. His eyes, those dark blue eyes that had broken Remus\u2019s heart a thousand times as a teenager, had turned dull gunmetal grey. He was a bag of bones, unsettled all over. It was to be expected.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come straight from Hogwarts.\u201d He said. His voice was as hard and rasping as it had been last summer.\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Remus said, rubbing the back of his head. \u201cDumbledore sent a message ahead.\u201d\n\n\nSirius twitched, slightly, and nodded. \u201cSomething happened at the tournament. Harry was kidnapped.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?! Is he--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe came back, he\u2019s fine - fine as can be expected. Voldemort\u2019s back, too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true. Harry faced him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus felt sick.\n\n\n\u201cThe Order\u2019s reforming. Dumbledore told me to come here, lie low.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Remus nodded, still taking in the shock.\n\n\n\u201cIf that's\u2026\u201d Sirius\u2019s face softened, he looked younger - more like the real Sirius, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind? I just followed orders without thinking, but I could go somewhere else if\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Remus said, very firmly, snapping out of the confusion that had gripped him ever since Dumbledore\u2019s patronus appeared. \u00a0He put a hand on Sirius\u2019s shoulder. Oh, he was so thin. \u201cOf course you should stay here, it's your\n\n\nhome.\n\n\n\u201d\n\n\nSirius looked so relieved that Remus wanted to pull him close and wrap his arms around him. But he didn't. He looked at Grant, who was watching warily from the kitchen doorway.\n\n\nSirius followed his eye line and gave a start. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a question; just a statement of fact.\n\n\nGrant, god love him, gave his breeziest smile, \u201cAlright, mate? Tell you what, you look like you could do with a Chinese. I\u2019ll pop out, shall I, Remus?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think I do.\u201d Grant smiled.\n\n\nHe grabbed his wallet from the coffee table on his way out. He didn\u2019t kiss Remus on the cheek, as he usually might, but gave him a pat on the shoulder and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be half an hour.\u201d He closed the door softly behind himself.\n\n\nSirius and Remus stood in silence for what felt like minutes.\n\n\nSirius frowned, making deep lines appear in his face.\n\n\n\u201cThat was rude of me. I didn\u2019t mean to be rude.\u201d He began to scratch the back of his hand, anxiously, his fingernails long and black with grime. Remus felt a sorrowful tug deep in his stomach, and reached out to still him.\n\n\n\u201cHow about a shower? Then a sit down. Everything's ok.\u201d\n\n\nSirius looked up at him. Remus had forgotten how much smaller he was.\n\n\n\u201cSounds good.\u201d Sirius nodded, weakly.\n\n\nRemus showed him to the bathroom, which was silly, because obviously he knew where the bathroom was; nothing had changed in thirteen years. While Sirius was washing, Remus went to the bedroom to find some clean clothes.\n\n\nHe pulled a few shirts out of the dresser - he wanted to give Sirius\n\n\nhis\n\n\nthings to wear, not Grant\u2019s, but after all this time Remus honestly didn\u2019t know which belonged to who. He settled on an oversized knitted jumper, which was definitely his. It would swamp Sirius, but it would be comfortable. Digging out a pair of tartan pyjama bottoms to go with it, he lay them carefully on the bed.\n\n\nThere was only one bed in the flat - there had only ever been one bed and they had only ever needed one bed. The problem of where to put Sirius was unanswerable. Remus was still staring down at the clothes when he heard the water go off (the boiler stuttered and clunked a few times, he\u2019d been meaning to look at it for ages) and the bathroom door click unlocked.\n\n\n\u201cRemus?!\u201d Sirius called out, a note of panic in his voice.\n\n\n\u201cBedroom.\u201d Remus replied.\n\n\nSirius entered, his hair dripping on the carpet. He\u2019d wrapped the biggest bath sheet around himself like a shawl, covering his whole body from neck to skinny ankles. Remus looked away, embarrassed, and gestured at the clothes laid out.\n\n\n\u201cHere.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ll let you change.\u201d\n\n\nHe made to leave, but Sirius\u2019s hand darted out and grabbed his arm. He had that wild look in his eye again,\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d He said, \u201cCould you stay in the room?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOk\u2026\u201d Remus nodded, patting Sirius\u2019s claw-like hand. He\u2019d been scratching it again, it was red raw.\n\n\nRemus turned and looked at the curtains while Sirius dressed himself. His movements sounded slow, like an old man, or an invalid - not like elegant, energetic Sirius Black. Fury seared through Remus.\n\n\nThey took everything from him,\n\n\nhe thought, fiercely,\n\n\neverything that made him who he was.\n\n\n\nWhen he turned around, Sirius was staring at the bed. Remus looked too, trying to see it through Sirius\u2019s eyes. The neatly made bedspread; the matching bedside tables; one with a book on top, the other with a packet of cigarettes.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll sleep on the couch.\u201d Sirius said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to muck anything up between you and\u2026 and\u2026 sorry, his name\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGrant.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGrant.\u201d Sirius looked away again. His eyes never rested long, he was always searching the corners of the room for something. \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten a lot, I think.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ok.\u201d\n\n\nRemus had never felt a pain like this. And Remus had been feeling pain most of his life. \u201cCome and sit down. Cup of tea?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCup of tea.\u201d Sirius parroted back.\n\n\nRemus nodded, slowly, then led him into the kitchen.\n\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Sirius said, after a little while, \u201cSorry, I\u2026 I keep forgetting \u00a0things.\u201d\n\n\nRemus touched his arm, gently,\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok. Go and sit. I\u2019ll be a minute, you can hear me from the living room.\u201d\n\n\nSirius left, silently. Remus breathed a sigh of relief - the atmosphere was still thick with memory, and hurt, and Azkaban, but at least it was bearable when Sirius wasn\u2019t standing\n\n\nright there\n\n\n.\n\n\nLast year, in the shack, Remus hadn\u2019t had time to feel anything other than terror and joy. And, typically, he had spent the rest of his time since trying to pretend none of it had happened at all. Not because he\u2019d wanted to, but because it was the only thing he\n\n\ncould\n\n\ndo. He should have known better; should have known that Sirius always demanded confrontation.\n\n\nHe took a long time over the tea, brewing it in a pot, rather than the electric kettle. How did Sirius take his tea? He couldn\u2019t remember. Maybe he had never known - Sirius usually made it, back then. In the end, Remus simply put out everything, setting up a tray with immaculate attention and care, as if he was serving the queen. Slice of lemon. Little jug of milk. Bowl of brown sugar lumps. There weren\u2019t any biscuits left, Grant had had the last of the digestives.\n\n\nWhen it was all ready, he still hadn\u2019t the nerve to carry it through. He panicked for a moment, before hearing the door click open. Had it been half an hour already?\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Orright?!\u201d Grant\u2019s brash, overloud cockney accent filled the flat, warming it instantly. He acted as if there was nothing at all out of the ordinary as he bustled into the living room, laden with food.\n\n\nRemus could hear him setting it all out on the coffee table, unwrapping cartons of egg fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, chow mein, pork balls, chinese ribs, spring rolls; all the while chatting away to Sirius,\n\n\n\u201cBlimey, don\u2019t you look better after a wash, eh? Still got that nice thick hair. Jealous, I\u2019ll be bald by the time I\u2019m forty, reckon. Seen how grey Remus is? Looks distinguished, I tell \u2018im, but \u2018e don\u2019t listen\u2026\u201d\n\n\nFortified, Remus lifted the tray and carried it into the living room. Sirius was sitting primly on the edge of the couch, staring at Grant the way an animal stares at a potential predator.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll grab plates\u2026\u201d Grant said, passing Remus on his way back to the kitchen. He didn\u2019t make eye contact. Remus didn\u2019t blame him. The situation wasn\u2019t fair on anyone; least of all Grant.\n\n\nRemus tried to smile at Sirius, offering the tea tray. \u201cHere we are.\u201d He murmured.\n\n\nSirius looked at the tea, the lemon, the sugar, then down at his hands.\n\n\n\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Remus asked, \u201cIs this all right?\u201d\n\n\nSirius nodded. \u201cLovely, thanks. You shouldn\u2019t go to all this trouble.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNonsense.\u201d\n\n\nGrant brought in the plates. They sat around the coffee table, Sirius on the sofa, Remus in the armchair, and Grant on the floor. Sirius put food on his plate and picked at it like a bird. He didn\u2019t use the forks they\u2019d put out, or the chopsticks that came with the meal, he used his hands to eat, tearing everything into small pieces and feeding them into his mouth. Remus and Grant politely ignored it, making light conversation.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to do a proper shop, on my way back from work tomorrow.\u201d Grant said. \u201cGet you a toothbrush, some things like that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can do that.\u201d Remus said. He was keen to take care of Sirius himself; as if he\u2019d brought home a stray he ought to be responsible for. He looked at Sirius, \u201cYour clothes and books are boxed up in the garage. I\u2019ll go and have a look tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou kept them?\u201d Sirius looked up, almost hopefully, \u201cYou kept my things?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEr. Well, after everything, Mary showed up and did it for me. I wasn\u2019t\u2026 I wasn\u2019t very well, for a while. \u00a0I\u2019m not sure what state they\u2019re in, I haven\u2019t been there since.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to keep anything.\u201d\n\n\nRemus didn\u2019t know what to say, so he shrugged. It hadn\u2019t really been a case of wanting to hang onto Sirius\u2019s stuff; more that he\u2019d just hidden it away so he didn\u2019t have to think about it. He was glad now, obviously, but he didn\u2019t want any more credit than he was due.\n\n\nThey finished eating, and Sirius wiped his greasy hands on the legs of his pyjama bottoms, and Remus tried not to wince. Sirius used to be so fastidious about cleanliness - Remus\u2019s disorganisation had always irritated him. Another change.\n\n\nGrant got up to collect the plates and cutlery for washing up. Sirius sat up, \u201cI can do that, let me,\u201d he withdrew a wand from his baggy sleeve.\n\n\n\u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d Remus asked, frowning.\n\n\n\u201cStole it,\u201d Sirius looked down, turning it in his hand, \u201cTook a while to get used to, but I can handle it ok now. Here, let me...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Grant said. He was smiling, but you couldn\u2019t hear it in his voice. \u201cI\u2019d prefer to do it normally.\u201d He turned, carrying the pile of plates into the kitchen.\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nMuffliato\n\n\n.\u201d Sirius muttered. Remus blinked, surprised. He hadn\u2019t heard that spell in a very long time, and he had never, ever used something like that with Grant present. It felt disloyal, sneaky. \u201cIs the floo connection working?\u201d Sirius asked, urgently.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus said. \u201cI never re-connected. I don\u2019t actually do very much magic at home, because--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, because of the muggle,\u201d Sirius finished, and Remus could have sworn he rolled his eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s made a lot of changes, I see.\u201d He gave the TV a very pointed look.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s his home too,\u201d Remus said, defensively.\n\n\n\u201cWhatever, I don\u2019t care. Right, we\u2019ll need to re-connect it. If I\u2019m staying here, that is. We\u2019ll need to be able to communicate with the rest of the Order.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe rest of the--\u201d\n\n\n\u201c--have you got an owl?\u201d Sirius glanced around.\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Remus said. He chewed his lip, \u201cI\u2019ve got a phone.\u201d He offered, trying to lighten the mood.\n\n\n\u201cFor merlin\u2019s sake, Moony!\u201d Sirius barked, his rough voice crackling with urgency, \u201cWhat have you been\n\n\ndoing\n\n\nall these years, moping about?!\u201d\n\n\nRemus flinched - both at being called Moony, which nobody ever did, and at the cruel accusation.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been surviving.\u201d He said, trying to stay calm, \u201cHow easy do you think it is for me to hold down a job? And it\u2019s not as if I\u2019ve had anyone I need to keep in touch with.\u201d\n\n\nSirius didn\u2019t say anything, but pursed his lips and scowled, staring at the carpet. Remus sighed, closing his eyes. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, gently, \u201cI can imagine how you must feel. I know you want to do everything at once, now you\u2019re free, but let\u2019s just take things slowly tonight, ok? Get a proper night\u2019s sleep and we\u2019ll work on a plan tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\nSirius nodded, mollified. Remus felt proud of himself. He hadn't cried, or shouted, and that was pretty good progress, at least as far as Sirius Black was concerned. Grant re-entered the room, and Remus quickly undid the\n\n\nmuffliato\n\n\ncharm.\n\n\n\u201cShall I stick the telly on?\u201d He asked the silent room. Remus nodded. Sirius returned to scowling.\n\n\nThe news was on, and then the weather. Then some American hospital drama, which made Grant tut and switch over. There was a documentary on about Fleetwood Mac, which they all vaguely watched. No one really spoke, except Grant every now and then.\n\n\nRemus was in turmoil, his brain whirring into overdrive as too many conflicting thoughts and feeling flashed past. It had been so long since he\u2019d been in the same room as Sirius, and now they couldn\u2019t even talk to each other without hitting some immeasurable barrier, whether it was the war, or lost friends, or their mutual betrayal. And now the order was reforming, and it looked like everyone expected Remus to sign himself up, once again, without hesitation. But he wasn\u2019t the boy he\u2019d been last time. He was old, and he was tired. He had other responsibilities - he had\n\n\nGrant\n\n\n.\n\n\nAt about ten o\u2019clock, Sirius yawned.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, me too.\u201d Grant commented, yawning back. \u201cGot work in the morning, maybe it\u2019s time for bed.\u201d He looked at Remus, obviously hoping for some sort of direction.\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus said, uncertain. He placed his hands on the arms of his chair to push himself up, stiff from sitting so rigidly all evening. \u201cUm. Sirius, are you ok here? I\u2019ll get you a cushion and a duvet.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Sirius said. He stretched again, and transformed into Padfoot. Grant breathed in, sharply, at the surprise, but said nothing. The big black dog curled up on the couch and closed its eyes.\n\n\n\u201cCan you do that?\u201d Grant whispered, half an hour later, once he and Remus were both in bed. \u201cTurn into a wolf whenever you like?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus said. \u201cHe\u2019s an animagus. He learnt how to do it. I\u2019m \u00a0werewolf, I got bitten, I don\u2019t get a choice.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBad luck.\u201d Grant said, \u201cMind you, don\u2019t think I\u2019d like it much, if you could.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t hurt you, he\u2019s still got his normal mind when he\u2019s a dog.\u201d Though Remus wasn\u2019t sure what Sirius\u2019s \u2018normal mind\u2019 was like, anymore. Everything else about him was rumpled and damaged in some way.\n\n\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d Grant said, turning his head to watch Remus\u2019s face.\n\n\n\u201cI think so.\u201d Remus said, honestly, \u201cBut it\u2019s weird. It\u2019s going to be difficult, I think.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow long will he be here?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh. I don\u2019t know. A while, maybe. He\u2019s talking about\u2026 about another war. I might need to help.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Remus screwed up his face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, the whole situation is\u2026 it\u2019s a fucking nightmare, really. I need some time to think.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI wish I could help.\u201d Grant said. \u201cI wish I understood.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re so good with Sirius.\u201d Remus offered, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to him, he\u2019s so\u2026 I dunno, prickly. I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll say something wrong and he\u2019ll bite my head of.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHmm, well I have a bit of experience with those types.\u201d Grant said, his lips curling, \u201cAnyway, he\u2019s obviously been through the mill. Just gotta be patient. Kind. You can\u2019t force him to get better, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nSirius slept for a very long time. Long after Grant had left for work, and Remus had eaten breakfast and marked a few exam papers. He stayed in the kitchen, but he could see the living room couch through the door, just in case.\n\n\nIt was almost half past eleven when Padfoot jerked awake, and began barking loudly, leaping off the couch.\n\n\n\u201cShh!\u201d Remus ran into the living room anxiously, \u00a0\u201cSirius, it\u2019s me! You\u2019re here, you\u2019re with me!\u201d\n\n\nThe dog stopped, cocked its head, then transformed back into Sirius. His eyes were wide and his jaw shadowy with stubble. He looked like a mad person. Remus tried to be patient, and kind, like Grant said. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, steadying his voice, \u201cIt\u2019s just that we\u2019re not allowed pets, here, and if the neighbours hear you\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Sirius looked down, embarrassed. \u201cYou\u2019d think I\u2019d be used to it now. Been out for a year.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Remus shook his head, \u201cSorry I shouted.\u201d\n\n\nThings stayed that awkward for most of the day. They went out to the garage after Sirius had eaten breakfast.\n\n\nThe door took a few goes to heave open, and Sirius had to stay in dog form while they were out of the flat, so it fell to Remus. Still, they got in eventually, and everything was very much as they remembered. No motorbike, of course, though all the tools were still there. Sirius\u2019s clothes and books were neatly stacked in labelled boxes, without so much as a layer of dust on them.\n\n\n\u201cMary must have done some sort of preserving spell,\u201d Remus commented.\n\n\nSirius nodded vaguely, walking through the piles of relics like an ancient monk. He selected a few things to take back to the flat - or rather, for Remus to carry back. Sirius chose robes and wizard clothes, none of his muggle stuff, not even his old leather jacket, which Remus found stuffed inside a box under some records. He had to resist the urge to bury his face in it and inhale the gorgeous scent; as if the jacket had more of Sirius in it than the man standing next to him.\n\n\nBack at the flat, Sirius changed into the robes at once. Remus could see why - he looked much better already, in his own things, having had a few good meals and a proper wash. His hair was a bit straggly, and still had knots in it despite the fact that he\u2019d clearly used half a bottle of shampoo on it.\n\n\nHe slept again, after lunch. Remus didn\u2019t see how, he\u2019d only been awake a few hours. Still, despite Sirius\u2019s inability to stay still, he exhausted easily. He curled up on the couch again, in the nest of blankets he\u2019d created, and Remus sat beside him with the TV on very low. At least when Sirius slept he was a dog, and therefore easier to share a room with.\n\n\nHe was grumpy, when he woke up. He squinted at the TV, then at Remus.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you read any more?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course I do.\u201d Remus gestured at the bookcases either side of the fireplace, which were sagging under the weight. \u201cTV is just background noise.\u201d\n\n\nSirius grunted, sitting up and straightening his clothes. He ran his fingers through his hair, and they got caught. He winced.\n\n\n\u201cDo you want to try washing it again?\u201d Remus asked, \u201cIf you put loads of conditioner on, then comb it through, that might help?\u201d\n\n\nHe remembered Grant telling him that about two brothers who\u2019d come to the remand centre. They\u2019d been neglected, and had never had their hair cut or brushed, and they were frightened of the clippers. Grant remembered Matron\u2019s brutal buzz cuts, and he immediately promised them he wouldn\u2019t cut their hair. He\u2019d spent hours gently combing it through, instead, and his hands were wet and cold for so long his eczema flared up and his palms were rough and chapped for weeks.\n\n\nSirius seemed to appreciate the suggestion, so Remus went to run the bath. Sirius followed him. He didn\u2019t seem to want to be left alone at all, even if he didn\u2019t want to talk.\n\n\nRemus rooted around in the medicine cabinet for a good strong comb, and some scissors, just in case. He set them on the edge of the bathtub, and stepped back. \u201cEr\u2026 shall I leave you to it?\u201d He asked, as the bathwater steamed gently. Sirius rubbed his arm, looking around.\n\n\n\u201cNo I think I\u2019d rather\u2026 if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnything you like,\u201d Remus said.\n\n\nLet him lead the way,\n\n\nGrant had suggested.\n\n\nGo with the flow.\n\n\nHe thought about turning around as Sirius undressed, but that seemed redundant if he was staying in the room, and anyway, Sirius had no scruples about stripping off in front of him. There was nothing sensual about it; he did it in the same way he now ate with his hands, or wiped his mouth with his sleeve, or curled up tightly on the sofa; he did it because he had forgotten how to act around other people.\n\n\nHe was so thin, so frail, his elbows jutted out like knives and his hollow ribs moved under his paper white skin. His once warm, slender wrists, which Remus had adored, were now so narrow they looked like they'd snap as he lowered himself into the bath.\n\n\nRemus pretended to be tidying the bathroom, and started folding up the flannel hanging off the side of the sink, straightening the towels slung over the radiator. He was embarrassed, he didn't want to stare. Though, to be honest, Sirius probably wouldn't notice, either way.\n\n\nEventually, Remus sat on the closed toilet lid, crossing his legs in an effort to look nonchalant - and because the bathroom was much too small for his annoying gangly body. Sirius leaned back into the hot water, making small slow waves slop gently against the plastic sides of the tub. He closed his eyes, and tilted his head back into the water, exposing his throat, his adam\u2019s apple protruding.\n\n\nRemus had to remember to close his mouth as Sirius resurfaced, opening his eyes and sweeping his hair back. Now it was wet, the grey had vanished, and he became suddenly younger, more recognisable.\n\n\nHe started lathering his hair with the shampoo, sitting up, leaning forward. Remus watched his bony white fingers clawing through the foam, and remembered how graceful Sirius had been as a young man, how every movement was perfectly weighted, how he used to treat his own body with such tenderness. The steam from the hot water stung Remus\u2019s eyes, and he had to blink away tears.\n\n\nSirius rinsed out the shampoo, then started on the conditioner, using loads of it, Remus would have to buy more.\n\n\n\u201cWe ought to make a list.\u201d Sirius said, abruptly.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Remus frowned.\n\n\n\u201cA list.\u201d Sirius said, picking up the comb. \u201cWe ought to make one. People to get in contact with, for Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFor Dumbledore.\u201d Remus repeated. He suddenly felt very tired.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, he said get in touch with the old crowd. Only my memory\u2019s shot, so you'll have to help. The names, you know.\u201d He tugged the comb through his knots, hard.\n\n\n\u201cYou really want to go right back to war, don\u2019t you?\u201d Remus said.\n\n\nSirius turned and gave him a look of disbelief, and with a horrible sinking feeling Remus realised that in Sirius\u2019s mind the war had never ended.\n\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Remus tried to explain, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t believe in the cause, it\u2019s just\u2026 I remember how it went last time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAs if I don\u2019t!\u201d Sirius hissed, yanking at the comb in his hair, \u201cI haven\u2019t been on holiday for twelve years!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I know, but\u2026\u201d Remus wished he\u2019d stop saying it like that.\n\n\nTwelve years\n\n\n. What forgiveness could there ever be, for that?\n\n\n\u201cIt's all we can do.\u201d Sirius said, fiercely, \u201cIt's the only thing that matters.\u201d He raised the comb again, looking as if he was about to stab himself with it, rather than groom himself. Remus couldn't stand it.\n\n\n\u201cStop that,\u201d he said, getting up. \u201cYou'll rip all your bloody hair out, come on. Let me do it.\u201d\n\n\nHe rolled up a towel and put it on the floor to kneel on, grabbing the comb out of Sirius's hand. Sirius looked at him warily for a moment, and Remus realised that they had not been this close yet - they had hugged, in the Shack a year ago, but that had been \u00a0pure adrenaline. It had not been intimate. This was.\n\n\n\u201cMay I?\u201d Remus asked, softening his voice.\n\n\nSirius nodded, slowly, then turned his head, so that Remus could reach. Leaning in, not too much, Remus began to work, sliding his fingers carefully through the slick black locks, gently easing the comb through in sections from the bottom up. Slowly, slowly, the knots began to loosen, giving way to that familiar old silken texture.\n\n\nIt was difficult work, and took a lot of patience, and the rest of the bottle of conditioner, but Remus finally felt like he was helping; he was in control and he was doing something positive. Sirius was so quiet and still the whole time; tense at first, but gradually relaxing, bit by bit - Remus could practically see his tendons slackening.\n\n\nOnce he was finished, Remus leaned back to survey his work, the muscles in his back ached like they were on fire, but it was worth it. He stood up, shakily, a hand on the sink. Sirius raised his hands, moved them gingerly over his head, fingers skimming the smooth surface.\n\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAny time.\u201d Remus smiled, sitting back on the loo seat.\n\n\nSirius rinsed his hair a few more times, then climbed out and dried himself, getting dressed again. Remus expected him to look at himself in the mirror, but he didn't, he purposefully avoided it, keeping his eyes down.\n\n\nBack in the living room, Remus made them tea and some cheese on toast, because he wanted Sirius to eat as often as possible. He expected Sirius to fall asleep again, but he didn't. He took some paper from Remus\u2019s pile of exams, and flipped it over, picking up a biro too.\n\n\n\u201cOk,\u201d he said, \u201cMoody, obviously, top of the list - after he's recovered of course, wait til you hear what happened to him at Hogwarts! Then the Weasley's, and Mary\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, not Mary.\u201d Remus said. \u201cShe won't\u2026 she's settled down, she's got kids. And the Weasley's, they've got\n\n\nseven\n\n\nkids, Sirius, you can't ask that of people\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don't need to.\u201d Sirius said, sharply. \u201cThey'll do what's right.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can't see it that way.\u201d Remus said, \u201cAll I can see is the cost of another war\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe don't have a choice!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know, I know, I just want us to\n\n\nthink\n\n\n, before we--\u201d\n\n\nWhat\u2019s happened to you, Remus?! This isn\u2019t like you. You\u2019re supposed to be a Gryffindor!\u201d\n\n\nThat struck a nerve. How\n\n\ndare\n\n\nhe!?\n\n\n\u201cQuite a bit has happened to me, actually.\u201d Remus said, acidly. \u201cI lost everyone I ever cared about in the last war, so forgive me if I\u2019m not thrilled about marching straight into battle again. I\u2019m not twenty-one any more.\u201d\n\n\nSirius shook his head, still unable to comprehend. \u201cWe\n\n\nowe\n\n\nit to them! To Lily and James!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t owe them anything!\u201d Remus shouted, his face burning with anger, \u201cMaybe\n\n\nyou\n\n\nfeel like you do, \u2018secret keeper\u2019, but if you recall, I wasn\u2019t fucking consulted on that one!\u201d\n\n\nHe didn't know why he said it; it just all came tumbling out before he could stop himself. He hasn't realised how angry he really was, until that moment. Clearly Sirius hadn't, either,\n\n\n\u201cMoony--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare call me \u2018Moony\u2019! Don\u2019t act like we\u2019re still\u2026 like nothing\u2019s changed! Like everything\u2019s fine, and I'm just going to do everything you say!\u201d\n\n\nHe stood up, he needed to get out, he needed a break. He turned on his heel, heading for the door.\n\n\n\u201cNo, Remus, please!\u201d Sirius cried out, his voice so taut and strangled, it frightened Remus. He turned back. Sirius stared up at him from the couch, so small and wide eyed. \u201cPlease don't leave me alone.\u201d He said.\n\n\nRemus relented, his temper draining away to nothing. He returned to his armchair, and sat down again. He pursed his lips. He rubbed his eyes. \u201cI won't,\u201d he said, wearily. \u201cI'm not going anywhere.\u201d"

You have thirty working days to respond to this offer, by either post or telephone.\n\n\n\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you.\n\n\n\n\nA.P. Green\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHead of Social Services, Brighton & Hove.\n\n\n\n\nGrant read the letter three times, just to make sure.\n\n\nWell. He really ought to be happy. Thrilled. This was amazing news. News worth celebrating. It was one way out of the mess he currently found himself in, anyway.\n\n\nHe shook his head, feeling terrible for thinking of Remus\u2019s life a \u2018mess\u2019. Even if that was a little bit true.\n\n\nHe had gone down for the interview a few weeks ago, telling Remus he was working late. Not that he wanted to hide anything from Remus - more like he just didn\u2019t want to jinx things. Grant wasn\u2019t a very lucky person, generally; stuff like this never, ever happened to him.\n\n\nGrant didn\u2019t believe in god, or guardian angels, or Buddha or Brahman - or\n\n\nanything\n\n\nother than his own willpower, but something about this job offer smacked of divine intervention. This was his dream job, after all. Perhaps this was the sign he was waiting for - as if old ex-boyfriends returning from prison wasn\u2019t enough of an omen.\n\n\nHe\u2019d been toying with the idea of moving for years. Grant loved London; it would always be in his blood, but they were both in their mid-thirties now, and maybe it was time for a change. He wanted to get Remus out to the countryside, to fresh air and sea and space. A fresh start, away from the miserable little flat. So when the position came up, and Grant\u2019s manager mentioned it to him, he leapt at the chance.\n\n\nOf course; that was all before Sirius came back.\n\n\nGrant re-read the letter again, from the top. He stared at his name, in official black and white printed text.\n\n\nA letter with my name on it, and it\u2019s not even a court summons\n\n\n, he joked to himself. He wished he could show his dickhead grandfather. Show him what nancy-boy delinquents can amount to when they put their minds to it.\n\n\nHe was proud of himself, and no matter what the situation was right now, he knew Remus would be proud of him too. He wished he could tell him straight away, but Remus was out, and Grant was hiding in the bedroom from Sirius.\n\n\nGrant was supposed to be keeping an eye on him, he\u2019d promised, but as soon as Remus was out the door, Sirius had said something nasty about not needing a \u2018nursemaid\u2019 (bloody hell, how posh was he?!) and turned into a dog again.\n\n\nIt was so painfully obvious that Black hated Grant\u2019s guts, so hiding out in the bedroom felt like the best solution.\n\n\nHe\u2019d have to wait for Remus to get home, then, to break the news. He hoped it wouldn\u2019t be too long, but he had no idea, really. Remus had gone to some sort of meeting, and hadn\u2019t given Grant any details.\n\n\nHe\u2019d talked to Sirius about it, though - at length. They muttered together in the living room, thinking Grant wouldn\u2019t notice. The pitch of their whispering swung wildly to and fro - one moment angry staccato hissing, the next soothing, low apologies. Their body language was the same - Grant learnt quickly that the important stuff between Sirius and Remus was the stuff neither of them said out loud. It was all in looks, gestures, tilted heads and raised eyebrows. Impossible for an outsider to keep up with - and Grant felt very much the outsider. He had never known two people could be simultaneously so angry with each other and so much in love.\n\n\nAnd it\n\n\nwas\n\n\nlove. Without a doubt.\n\n\nGrant got a sick feeling in his stomach. He\u2019d been ignoring it for days.\n\n\nRemus had been different for a while, but until that bloody black dog showed up Grant had thought there might be hope for recovery. A bit more time, a bit of space, some distance from all that darkness. Grant would pull Remus back from the edge; he had done it before, he could do it again.\n\n\nBut now it looked impossible - Remus did not want things back the way they were. He hadn\u2019t said it - maybe he didn\u2019t know it - but it was very obvious to Grant.\n\n\nLook, ok, Grant\n\n\nknew\n\n\nhe was not the brightest bulb in the box. Not as clever as Remus, anyway. Probably not as clever as Sirius. That had never bothered him much, because after all, he couldn\u2019t\n\n\nbe\n\n\nanyone but himself, and he had plenty else going for him. He worked hard, and he cared about people, and people cared about him, and those things were ingredients for a very happy life, in Grant\u2019s opinion.\n\n\nSo, he wasn\u2019t a genius, but he did know\n\n\nsome\n\n\nthings. He liked to think that at the very least, he knew when it was time to make a graceful exit.\n\n\nGrant loved Remus very much. He\u2019d probably loved him ever since that first day, twenty years ago, when the lanky, exhausted, skittish teenager had loped into the dorm room at St Edmund\u2019s.\n\n\nHe was so quiet, and so closed up, even though there was clearly a universe inside of him. Remus was never the same person twice; he was jaded and world-weary one moment, naive and blushing the next. He was bubbling with rage and love at the same time, and\n\n\nmost\n\n\nof the time he let love win.\n\n\nGrant liked to think he\u2019d had a bit of a hand in that. Especially over the past few years - Grant had worked hard to keep the softest parts of Remus safe. And he had; he\u2019d done a good job. He\u2019d taken care of him, until Remus didn\u2019t really need taking care of anymore. It was perhaps time to let go.\n\n\nHe still didn\u2019t want to just hand him back like a borrowed book.\n\n\nGrant had said goodbye to plenty of people over the course of his short yet colourful life, and not one of them had meant a thing, until Remus. Grant knew how pathetic that sounded. Nearing thirty-six, and only one real relationship - only one true friendship.\n\n\nWhatever happened, they would stay friends - there was no question of that. But Grant knew he had to be practical, and he had to look after himself, for once. Remus had always belonged to another world; that was partly what made him so attractive.\n\n\nThe time had come for Remus to go back where he belonged, and though Grant knew that for a while the absence would hurt, it was completely necessary.\n\n\nIt reminded him of that Suzanne Vega song - Grant was never one for reading too much into lyrics, not like Remus - he didn\u2019t have a poetic soul. But when the\n\n\nSolitude Standing\n\n\nalbum came out, it had been all over the radio, and Grant quite liked it - he always meant to buy the album, but never got around to it. She had a haunting voice, and this one particular tune was ghostly and strange.\n\n\nThen Remus had told him what it was about, and he hated it.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t usually like fairy tales - having recognised his sexuality at the age of six, the idea of brave knights rescuing damsels in distress had never inspired him much. But something about Calypso really struck a nerve.\n\n\nHe knew\n\n\nhe\n\n\nwasn\u2019t a siren, sitting on the rocks jiggling his tits at passing sailors, but he knew Remus. He knew Remus inside out. He\u2019d seen the change in him, since Sirius came back.\n\n\nAt first, Remus had clung to Grant as his protector, which made sense; \u00a0a bit of regression was probably to be expected, and Grant had always done his best to be solid ground for Remus. But after the stress of the first few days had passed, Remus and Sirius had both relaxed a little bit, and everything was different. So different it was shocking.\n\n\nGrant hadn\u2019t really known what their relationship was like when they were young, but he caught glimpses of it now. The way Remus\n\n\nstared\n\n\nat Sirius, as if he was the most gorgeous creature on earth. The heat in his eyes, the way his tongue played in the corner of his mouth, like he was daydreaming something utterly filthy. Remus had never looked at Grant like that, not really.\n\n\nAnd Sirius lit up, when Remus spoke to him.\n\n\nYes, they were obviously still in love, and it was not the same kind of love Grant and Remus had. He didn\u2019t know if it was better or not, but he could practically feel the conflict tearing Remus apart. He didn\u2019t\n\n\nwant\n\n\nto tear Remus apart; he never had. He still wanted to keep him safe.\n\n\nAnd there was Sirius himself - prim and poisonous, lurking like a spider all the time, glaring daggers whenever Grant entered the room. He made his feelings perfectly clear, and it made Grant indignant, made him want to fight harder to keep Remus.\n\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t up to Grant, any more. Remus was going somewhere Grant couldn\u2019t follow him. They\u2019d reached a crossroads, and it was all very clear. Maybe the letter really was an omen.\n\n\nHe conjured up the image he\u2019d been toying with - of him and Remus, in a house by the sea, reading books and eating breakfast in bed and going for walks into town. Getting older, making new friends. If they had a big enough house, they could begin fostering - Grant had been interested in doing that for years; he wanted to take care of kids no one else wanted, and if he was going to be a social worker then he\u2019d be a perfect candidate.\n\n\nHe let the fantasy wash over him one last time, and then he began to dismantle it. Because deep down Grant knew that Remus would never have left London, anyway, and Remus would never want to foster children - he\u2019d be too afraid he\u2019d hurt them on a full moon. That future had always been a bit of wishful thinking; it was more about Grant than Remus.\n\n\nIt was time to stop worrying about Remus, and what Remus needed. That wasn\u2019t his responsibility any more. Perhaps there would be someone else for Grant - he hoped so, he would never stop looking. Perhaps someone would want to keep him safe, for a change. Stranger things happened at sea.\n\n\nThe decision was made. Grant wrote a formal response, accepting the job offer. He\u2019d post it on his way out.\n\n\nHe began to pack quietly, hoping that Remus wouldn\u2019t come home until he was finished. There was so much to do - but at the same time, not a lot. Grant found himself surprised by just how easily the plan came together. He had his own bank account, and he didn\u2019t have any stake in the flat - he could stay at his aunt\u2019s pub down in Hove until he found his own place to live. He even had friends in Brighton, from when he\u2019d lived there as a kid.\n\n\nEasy peasy lemon-squeezy\n\n\n.\n\n\nSo once he\u2019d packed, he\u2019d just need to say goodbye. He hoped he could say it the right way, and not sound bitter or self-pitying. He hoped Remus would understand that Grant would always be there if he needed him; he\u2019d come running in a heartbeat.\n\n\nAt the same time he hoped that Remus would not need him. He hoped that he was leaving him in safe hands.\n\n\nFinished packing, Grant sat on the bed. He could hear the TV in the other room, up a bit too loud. Sirius left it on all night, sometimes, and it woke Grant up. But if he went through to turn it off, that hideous black dog would wake up and start growling at him in the dark. Probably a trauma thing; Grant didn\u2019t blame Sirius, but he wished it didn\u2019t have to manifest like that.\n\n\nCould he really trust a man like that to take care of anyone? Grant\u2019s heart ached as he imagined Remus - sweet, serious, sensitive Remus - being treated like a mental punching bag. He would just put up with it, Grant could tell; Remus felt so guilty about Sirius\u2019s imprisonment that he was willing to take all sorts of abuse for it. But that wasn\u2019t right.\n\n\nGrant stood up. He had to do one more thing, then, before he could leave.\n\n\nHe had to talk to Sirius."

            "content": "Well, my friends are gone and my hair is grey\n\n\nI ache in the places where I used to play\n\n\nAnd I'm crazy for love.\n\n\nBut I'm not coming on.\n\n\nI'm just paying my rent every day in the Tower of Song.\n\n\nSirius sat curled up on the couch, his arms around his legs. He was watching television. It was a bizarre muggle invention - a bit like the cinemas he\u2019d been to in his youth, only smaller\u2026\noh no, oh no\n\u2026 that brought back a memory of James. That summer they\u2019d gone to see the same film every day, and met those muggle girls. Had it been summer? Or Christmas? It might have been raining, and someone punched him. James or Remus? Surely Remus; James was never violent, even when Sirius really deserved it.\nSirius shut his eyes to drown out the cold, cruel voices in his head which wanted to drag him back through time, back to the very worst moments. He thought he could taste blood, but when he opened his eyes again, all he saw was the living room, and the silly talking muggle box.\nIt was his living room. Or it had been, once. It looked different, and Sirius had a hard time working out whether it was different, or he was just remembering wrong. The walls hadn\u2019t been repainted, the fireplace was there. It didn\u2019t stink of cigarette ash anymore, but there was still a burn mark in the carpet under the windowsill - had that been there before? Or had it happened in the years between?\nThe TV was the worst change; the most noticeable. Sirius had a strong memory of arguing against having one, a long time ago. Noisy, ugly muggle light-boxes. He still thought it was awful, but somehow he couldn\u2019t bring himself to stop watching it. It distracted him. It was a break from thinking; from remembering.\nHe had spent too much of his life remembering. Turning over events, over mistakes and half understood conversations. Sifting through it all again and again, until everything in his head was shaken loose in tiny fragments, no structure or narrative. He didn't want to sit and think anymore. He wanted to act. He wanted to do. And no one would let him.\nHe huffed, shifting position, tightening his grip on the arm of the couch. Remus had been invited to a meeting, and Sirius had been told to stay at home with the muggle. It would have been fine if he'd gone as Padfoot, he knew it would have, but no one would listen. They were treating him like a loose cannon, like someone who needed to be\ncontained\n. As if he hadn't spent a whole year alone, looking out for himself, without any help from anyone.\nHe wasn't going to be treated like a kid. He wasn't going to let them. Hadn't he earned his place?\nBut Moony - Remus, he had given Sirius that pained, pleading look, and it shut him up. He hated making Remus uncomfortable, it made him worried he would never get better. He knew he wasn't right in the head, he knew he was going about things all wrong, and that he was not himself. But Sirius had hoped a year would be enough. He was out, now, he was free, everyone who mattered finally knew the truth. It should make a difference. He should be normal again, by now.\nRemus wasn't helping, Sirius thought, darkly. How\ncould\nhe get his head straight, when everything was so weird? When Remus, his only friend left, could barely look at him without wincing, could barely speak to him without trailing off, glancing away. And the boyfriend. Sirius wondered how quickly that had happened, how soon the muggle had wormed his way in. Infected Remus with his mundanity; made his Moony quiet and cautious. No better than a muggle himself.\nIt was like a light in Remus had dimmed. Sirius looked for signs of the old Moony, but there was none of that wicked, mischievous energy, the blistering strength of Remus Lupin when he had an exciting plan.\nIt had taken Sirius ages to convince Remus just to go to the meeting. In the end, he had the impression Remus only went as a favour to him; to keep him calm. That was fine, as long as he went. And when he got back, he would tell Sirius everything, Sirius would make him. It was the least Remus could do.\nRemus would come around. He would see there was no other way. He would want to do it for Harry.\nSirius couldn't help smiling to himself, thinking about Harry. That incredible, brilliant, brave kid. James would be so proud\u2026\n\nJames, James I'm so sorry\u2026.\n\nHe shuddered, shut his eyes again, bracing himself against the cold. He wanted Remus so badly. He didn't want to be alone, not again, please...\n\u201cOrright?\u201d Grant, sauntered the room as if to remind Sirius that he was not alone at all. Grant smiled at him cheerfully as he came in. Sirius watched him warily.\nAlways bloody smiling. Weirdo\n.\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d Sirius replied, deliberately accentuating his annunciation to counter Grant\u2019s horrific butchered English.\nSirius had spent no time whatsoever with muggles, even before Azkaban, and found them confusing at best; like an alien species. And he\nhated\nGrant\u2019s cheerfulness with every inch of his being.\n\u201cFeelin\u2019 better?\u201d\nSirius grunted noncommittally. He didn\u2019t see that he owed any kind of explanation to this man. He tolerated him, for Remus\u2019s sake, but that was it.\n\u201cGood to hear,\u201d Grant nodded, dimples in his cheeks.\nSirius thought he must be incredibly stupid.\nWipe that inane grin off your face!\nbarked the spectre of Walpurga Black.\nSirius remembered Grant as a teenager, and he hadn\u2019t even been that good looking then. Fifteen years hadn\u2019t improved on his hairline or his skin. Sirius had no idea what Remus was still doing with Grant at all, and if he was stupid as well as plain looking, then Sirius was even more baffled as to why Moony would want him around.\nThe Remus\nhe\nknew -\nhis\nRemus would never suffer a fool.\n\u201cWhen he gets back,\u201d Grant was saying, now, still cheerful, still smiling, showing crooked teeth and a white scar in the corner of his mouth, \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d\n\u201cOh, ok.\u201d Sirius shrugged. He searched for something to say, \u201c...we need milk.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Grant chuckled, shaking his head lightly. He sat on the coffee table, directly opposite Sirius - so close their knees almost touched - and looked him in the eye, \u201cI\u2019m not popping out to the shops - I mean I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sirius frowned, \u201cWhy? Did Remus tell you to? Because it wasn\u2019t my idea.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s my idea,\u201d Grant said, no longer smiling. He had tired eyes, and Sirius realised that though Grant was smiling, he wasn\u2019t happy. He was very, very sad. Sirius didn\u2019t know what to do about it; he had his own problems.\nGrant kept talking, \u00a0\u201cI realised it a while ago. When he came back from the school, all shook up from seeing you again. I think I must\u2019ve known then. Should \u2018ave called time, but I couldn\u2019t just leave him alone...\u201d\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what you think--\u201d\n\u201cI was only ever looking after him for you,\u201d Grant said, raising a hand to keep Sirius quiet, \u201cI was never it for him. That\u2019s been you, all these years.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet here you are.\u201d Sirius muttered. He drew his knees back up, closing inwards. He wanted Grant to just go away, if he was leaving;\nget lost\n. He\u2019d have liked to transform into Padfoot, but he knew it wouldn\u2019t help matters and he\u2019d promised Remus not to.\n\u201cSee, now this is what I wanted to talk about.\u201d Grant said, his brows knitting together. \u201cIf I go, then you\u2019ve got to look after him, ok? Not blame him for whatever\u2019s happened to you in the last ten years.\u201d\n\u201c\nTwelve\nyears.\u201d Sirius corrected.\n\u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d Grant shrugged, \u201cIt\u2019s not been an easy life for any of us, sunshine, you\u2019re not special.\nRemus is\n.\u201d\nGrant\u2019s voice was suddenly hard and dangerous - almost aggressive \u201cHe\u2019s special to\nme\n, and if you\u2019re not man enough to be kind to him, then you don\u2019t deserve him. He\u2019s been waiting for you. He\u2019s never stopped waiting. He won\u2019t say it, because Remus doesn\u2019t say stuff like that. But he feels it. He feels\neverything\n, you must know that.\u201d\nSirius didn\u2019t reply.\n\u201cHe loves you.\u201d Grant said, steadily.\u201cYou have to love him back.\u201d\n\u201cI\ndo\nlove hi--\u201d\n\u201c--No,\u201d Grant was shaking his head again, \u201cNo, not like this. You have to be\nhere\n; a real, flesh and blood person. Not a dog. Not a ghost.\u201d\nSirius couldn\u2019t meet Grant\u2019s eyes anymore, he bowed his head and nodded.\n\u201cI will.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Grant smiled again, his face gentle once more. \u201cNow, when he gets moody - and he\nwill\nget moody - don\u2019t let him mope, and don\u2019t let him drink. He\u2019ll want it, after a full moon, but it only takes him longer to get well again if he does.\u201d\n\u201cI know what he needs after a full moon!\u201d Sirius growled, affronted. \u201cI\u2019ve known him since I was\neleven\n, who do you think you are, telling me--\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s been here.\u201d Grant returned, shortly. \u201cI don\u2019t think you get how hard it's been. I don\u2019t think you\u2026 look; you had him at his best, ok? I had his worst.\u201d He smiled, a little, \u201cAnd I was glad to do it. I have one part of him. You have the other. Can we agree?\u201d\nSirius stared at him a bit longer. Grant held out a hand to shake, and Sirius took it,\n\u201cOk.\u201d he said.\n\u201cLovely.\u201d Grant released him, and stood up. He went into the bedroom and came back with a large hold all, which he placed very purposefully by the door. \u201cGoing to have to leave a few books and things here for a bit.\u201d He said, \u201cBut I'll be back for \u2018em when I'm settled. S'pose you don't need a key, eh? Can you get in the magic way?\u201d\nSirius nodded, struck dumb. He couldn't believe this was happening. He wanted his heart to soar, he wanted to feel finally satisfied - but he couldn't help worrying. Grant had been a nuisance, but he had been a buffer, too. Would Remus blame him for it? Would he convince Grant to stay, or even worse, would he leave Sirius here, alone with the flat and the war and\u2026\nThere was a quiet shuffling noise outside the front door, and Sirius\u2019s ears pricked. Remus was back! His heart began to thrum against his ribcage, he licked his lips and sat up straighter, focussed in the door as it opened.\nRemus entered, head bowed, frowning a bit. Sirius couldn't believe how little Remus had changed, when everything else in the world was so different now. He was greyer, but he was still Moony, he was still completely devastatingly handsome and completely unphased about it.\nHe gave Sirius a smile as he came in, which was so like the teenage Remus, it took Sirius right back to Hogwarts - arriving at the breakfast table to find Remus already there, on his third helping of bacon and eggs, grinning at something stupid Sirius had just said.\nSee\n, he told himself,\nthere are still some good memories left.\n\u201cHello,\u201d he said, to the room.\n\u201cHiya.\u201d Grant replied. \u201cCup of tea?\u201d\n\u201cOoh, yes please,\u201d Remus nodded, now giving Grant a friendly smile. The muggle went into the kitchen.\n\u201cHow did it go?\u201d Sirius asked, already agitated, \u201cDid you see Dumbledore? What did he say?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing much. Nothing I haven't heard before. The Order needs a new HQ, we're all supposed to come up with ideas. Look, let's talk about it later?\u201d Remus shot a glance at the kitchen, where Grant was making the tea.\n\u201cDid he say anything about me? Dumbledore? How\u2019s Harry?\n\u201cHarry's perfectly fine, back at his aunt and uncle's for the summer. What's this bag doing here?\u201d\nRemus was looking down at the brown hold all packed with Grant's things. He looked at Sirius. Sirius shrugged, slouching down in the sofa. Remus frowned, and called out, \u201cGrant? What's this bag doing?\u201d\nGrant popped his head around the kitchen door, looking sheepish.\n\u201cAh. Can I have a quick word?\u201d\nRemus paled, visibly, and went into the kitchen."

He didn\u2019t want Sirius to hear them fighting, but things didn\u2019t look good at all, from the way Grant was calmly stirring his tea, not making eye contact.\n\n\n\u201cBrighton.\u201d Grant said, \u201cI\u2019ve had a job offer - a really good one. Better pay, and I can help more people, I can really make a difference.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut we live in London.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just up and leaving me for a\n\n\njob\n\n\n?!\u201d Remus was gearing up to start shouting; to shame Grant into staying. Grant just smiled sympathetically and shook his head,\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, now. You know it\u2019s about more than that.\u201d\n\n\nRemus\u2019s heart was beating hard, he felt sick, woozy, as if the floor was rocking back and forth. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just making things easier for you,\u201d Grant said - and from anyone else that might have sounded bitter. \u201cHaven\u2019t I always tried to do that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut I love you!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI love you too, my darling, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re just making the decision for me?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making a decision for me.\u201d Grant said, very firmly. He looked at Remus now, dead in the eye, and Remus could see there would be no more arguing. \u201cSirius needs you now, and you\u2019ll go to war, because that\u2019s who you are, you\u2019re mad and brave and incredible. There isn\u2019t a place for me in all that, so I need you to let me go. We\u2019ll always be friends, won\u2019t we? Care home yobs together?\u201d\n\n\nRemus wanted to wail. He wanted to fall to his knees and clutch Grant around the waist and hold him there forever, to beg and plead. He knew that was selfish. Grant was right; Remus had already decided to re-join the Order, he had decided the moment Sirius returned. It wasn\u2019t fair to keep Grant around for that, it was downright dangerous. But he needed him, oh, he really, really needed Grant. Remus wasn\u2019t sure he could do it all alone, not with Sirius the way he was.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll break my heart if you go now.\u201d Remus said, aware he sounded sulky and petulant.\n\n\nGrant shook his head lightly, holding his ground. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, love. But it\u2019s breaking my heart to stay.\u201d\n\n\nAnd in an instant, Remus understood. He saw Grant properly for the first time, not as his protector, his champion, but as a person who was not so very different from him, who was just as vulnerable to suffering.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a proper goodbye, eh?\u201d Grant said, softly. \u201cYou\u2019re not shot of me yet.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t always been fair to you.\u201d Remus said. He had wanted to say it for a long time now. He wanted some kind of forgiveness.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been fine,\u201d Grant smiled, without a trace of blame. \u201cYou\u2019ve been my little bit of magic.\u201d\n\n\nRemus made a strangled noise, and tried not to cry. Grant hugged him, and they held each other for the last time.\n\n\nGrant left Remus in the kitchen, with two cups of tea - one for Remus, one for Sirius. Remus stood in silence and waited for the door to go. When he heard it shut, he covered his mouth with his hand and closed his eyes. He breathed in and out for a few moments, then walked into the living room. Sirius was still on the couch. He looked anxious, rubbing his hands together.\n\n\n\u201cRemus, I--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Remus held up his hand, shaking his head, \u201cNo, I need a minute.\u201d\n\n\nHe went into the bedroom and closed the door. He sat on the bed and cried and cried. Once that was done with, he washed his face and went back to Sirius.\n\n\nThere was so much work to do.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nMonday 10th July 1995\n\n\nThings were harder, after Grant left. Remus felt as though he had lost his rock; the person who had kept him safe for thirteen years. The man Remus was left with was practically a stranger; a gaping hole of misery and fear and vengeful rage. Remus was on eggshells, and the war stretched ahead of them - would it always be like this?\n\n\nThey kept focussed on the war, mostly because Remus refused to discuss Grant, or his feelings. It was too much, in those early days. They spent their time working on lists of contacts, getting in touch with the old crowd, digging up old information from the last war. Sirius hooked them back into the floo network, using a secret connection only accessible to the right people, and time and time again the two of them knelt on the hearth rug, speaking into the flames; Sirius explaining his story to each member. Few of them took much convincing. All of them believed that Voldemort was back, and wanted to do something about it.\n\n\nWhen they weren\u2019t working for Dumbledore, Remus put the TV on and more often than not, Sirius would transform into Padfoot and doze off. Remus did all of the cooking - Sirius offered, but Remus wouldn\u2019t allow it. He said he wanted Sirius to rest, to recuperate, but really he just wanted to be in a different room, most of the time. Sirius still slept on the couch, because neither of them were able to broach the subject.\n\n\n\u201cFull moon on Wednesday,\u201d Remus said, one afternoon. They\u2019d just signed off with Kingsley - an Auror Moody had brought in, who seemed pretty capable. Remus wasn\u2019t sure what that was worth; he\u2019d seen plenty of capable wizards die.\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Sirius replied, brusquely.\n\n\nThey sat side by side on the couch, blankly watching the TV. It was only the muggle news, but it might as well have been static, for all they cared. Just a reason not to look at each other.\n\n\n\u201cI usually leave an hour or so before sunset,\u201d Remus continued. \u201cGives me time to clear the area, if I need to.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI remember how it works.\u201d Sirius said.\n\n\n\u201cOk, sorry.\u201d Remus muttered, irritated. \u201cJust thought you\u2019d want to know. But if you\u2019ve got other plans, then by all means, stay here.\u201d\n\n\nSirius looked at him. \u201cOh. You want me to come?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOnly if you want to,\u201d Remus said, hurriedly, \u201cI don\u2019t mind either way.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDumbledore said I need to stay here at all times\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine. Stay here then.\u201d Remus folded his arms tightly across his chest, feeling hurt.\n\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d Sirius said.\n\n\n\u201cGreat.\u201d Remus drawled, sarcastically.\n\n\nIt was how almost all of their conversations seemed to go. One of them would deliberately misunderstand, or become unreasonably defensive about a tiny matter. Then the other would bite back, and around and around, until they both just stopped talking and ignored each other. But if Remus got up, or made to leave the room, Sirius would give him that terrified look;\n\n\n\u201cWhere are you going??\u201d\n\n\nand Remus would sit back down again, and the whole scene would re-set.\n\n\nHe thought that bringing up the full moon might cheer Sirius up a bit. Sirius had always loved full moons, and it meant he could leave the flat for once.\n\n\nCan\u2019t you just be normal?!\n\n\nRemus found himself thinking, angrily,\n\n\nI don\u2019t want to live with a stranger, I want my best friend back. I need help.\n\n\n\nThen he felt guilty. Because obviously Sirius couldn\u2019t help it, and if he really thought about it, they had always been a fractious couple; they were both hotheaded Gryffindors, after all.\n\n\nStill. Sirius may not be a complete stranger, but he was certainly\n\n\nstrange\n\n\n. Had he always been so watchful, so quick to anger? Or had Azkaban done that to him? Or - worst of all - was it all Remus\u2019s fault?\n\n\nWithout Grant there, Remus began to wonder whether he seemed different himself. Perhaps years of living like a muggle had made him less interesting. He was slower than he\u2019d been as a teenager, more cautious. He rarely laughed.\n\n\nIt was stupid, but Remus was even more worried about how he looked. He had never been a vain person; he\u2019d always been very ordinary looking, scarred and a bit gangly, even when Sirius had known him. But at least back then Remus had been\n\n\nyoung\n\n\n. Now, his hair was grey all over, only a few strands of the original mousey shade left. He had more scars than ever, and sometimes he still smoked, which made him cough like an old coal miner.\n\n\nHe was so much less than he had been before.\n\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work, is it?\u201d Sirius said, abruptly, breaking Remus\u2019s thoughts.\n\n\nNo tact. Once he had been so silver tongued he could talk anyone into anything; could reel off dirty jokes like they were romantic poetry. But now everything Sirius said was sudden and blunt and full of raw urgency.\n\n\n\u201cWhat isn't?\u201d Remus asked, shaken. He kept his eyes fixed on the TV.\n\n\n\u201cThis. You and me. In the same room. Trying to act like\u2026 trying to be ok with each other. After everything that\u2019s happened, and fourteen years\u2026 it's just going to be too much.\u201d\n\n\nRemus finally turned to look at him, ready to be annoyed again, but found that Sirius was staring down at his hands, twisting them hard in his lap so that the skin pulled and his knuckles whitened. He had scars too, now.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t look so old and strange, then; he just looked like Sirius. And he was frightened.\n\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Remus said softly. He reached over and stilled Sirius\u2019s hands with his own, weaving their scarred bony fingers together. He caught his eye and smiled encouragingly. \u201cYou were always too much for me. I never minded.\u201d\n\n\nThe look of relief which flooded Sirius\u2019s face was worth every lost moment. It was an entire lifetime. He raised Remus\u2019s hand to his lips, and gently kissed the inside of his palm.\n\n\nThey returned to the TV after that, but kept holding hands.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThursday 14th July\n\n\nThankfully, the full moon was a welcome change of pace. They apparated to the Brecon Beacons together, and both transformed on a mountainside. The wolf was thrilled to be reunited with its old companion, and they spent their time chasing foxes through the grasslands, running together for miles and miles. They were better together, in their canine bodies; more natural, more at ease. Perhaps the lack of inhibition, or perhaps the bond forged between them as dog and wolf was not as easily broken.\n\n\nWhen Remus turned back, at dawn, Padfoot licked his face gleefully, nuzzling into him, and Remus laughed, for the first time since Sirius had returned to London.\n\n\nThey were still smiling when they got back to the flat, and it felt bigger than before; less of a cage.\n\n\n\u201cI forgot how strong you were,\u201d Sirius beamed, full of energy, \u201cI forgot you were faster than me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course you did,\u201d Remus grinned, \u201cArrogant prick. I could always beat you.\u201d\n\n\nHe picked up the post sitting on the doormat and flicked through, as Sirius flung himself onto the couch, sprawling out. It was the first time Remus had seen him look really relaxed in their flat again, and it made him feel warm inside.\n\n\nFlicking through the bills and takeaway leaflets, Remus stopped short as he reached a postcard. It had Grant\u2019s new address on it. Nothing else, just the address, neatly printed. The needle sharp sting of regret hit Remus, and he sighed, heavily. There was no phone number. Either Grant didn\u2019t have one yet (which seemed very unlikely, as he was barely off it normally, and needed one for work), or he was telling Remus not to get in touch.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Sirius said, from the couch, ever watchful.\n\n\n\u201cNothing. Grant\u2019s new address, that\u2019s all.\u201d Remus put it on the mantelpiece. \u201cI really need a lie down, I think I\u2019ll go to bed.\u201d\n\n\nHe downed some painkillers - only over the counter stuff, nothing exciting - and went to sleep. Luckily that was easy enough, after a full moon. When he woke up, the bedroom felt cold and empty. It was long after midday, and he could smell bacon cooking, the salty, savoury scent wafting its way through the flat.\n\n\nHe got up and followed the scent to the kitchen, where Sirius was standing over the hob, agitating a sizzling pan of bacon and eggs. He turned, seeing Remus and smiled,\n\n\n\u201cThought you\u2019d be hungry. You\u2019re always hungry.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus nodded, yawning and scratching his head. \u201cCheers.\u201d\n\n\nRemus made the toast quickly, with his wand - he was getting back into the habit of using magic again now that his last ties to the muggle world had been cut.\n\n\nThey sat at the table in the living room, and Sirius even made an effort to use a knife and fork. Remus smiled at that, remembering James and Sirius\u2019s impeccable pureblood table manners.\n\n\nHe will come back to me,\n\n\nRemus told himself, as Sirius buttered his toast daintily,\n\n\nbit by bit.\n\n\n\nThe postcard from Grant was still sitting up on the mantelpiece. The image on the front was of Brighton Pavillion. \u201cI\u2019d better start boxing up the rest of his things,\u201d Remus said, thinking out loud. \u201cFind a way to get them to him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe said he\u2019d come back, when he was settled.\u201d Sirius said, unexpectedly.\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Remus blinked, \u201cDid you talk, then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA little bit,\u201d Sirius shrugged, faking nonchalance, \u201cJust to say goodbye. He told me to look after you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I see.\u201d Remus said, quietly. \u201cWell, sorry about that. That wasn\u2019t his place to say.\u201d\n\n\nHe wanted very much to keep these two halves of his life separate.\n\n\n\u201cNo, it was ok,\u201d Sirius said. They were quiet for a bit , eating. And then\u2026 \u201cWhen did it happen?\u201d Sirius asked, back to his sharp abruptness.\n\n\n\u201cWhen did what happen?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou and him. How soon after\u2026 after I went to prison?\u201d\n\n\nRemus set down his fork. \u201cWhy are you asking me that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to fill in the gaps - the stuff I missed.\u201d\n\n\nSomething inside Remus grew hot and fierce.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what Grant has to do with any of it. Do you want a list of everyone I\u2019ve shagged since you\u2019ve been gone?\u201d\n\n\nSirius breathed in, sharply, at that. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, then. Leave him out of it. He\u2019s gone now, that\u2019s that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have asked. I just thought... \u201c\n\n\n\u201cI never cheated on you.\u201d Remus said, hardening his voice, \u201cSo you can stop wondering. I never, ever betrayed you. Even if you think I did.\u201d\n\n\nSirius frowned, and looked down at his food. \u201cYou\n\n\nare\n\n\nstill angry about that, then.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be.\u201d Remus said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be, but I am. You thought I was a\n\n\nspy\n\n\n, Sirius! You thought I would try to hurt Lily and James - you thought I would try to hurt\n\n\nyou\n\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was confused,\u201d Sirius said, his voice small, \u201cEverything was such a mess, everything was so difficult, and no one knew anything, no one trusted anybody--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI remember.\u201d Remus snapped. \u201cI was there. I still trusted my friends.\u201d\n\n\nSirius kept staring at his food, but Remus wasn\u2019t finished, this had to come out eventually, he knew how it felt to leave things unsaid.\n\n\n\u201cD\u2019you know how stupid I was? D\u2019you want to know how completely dense I was, in those last months? I thought you wanted to break up with me! I wanted to come back from the pack and see if we could make things up - it never crossed my mind that you thought I was a\u2026 I mean, fucking hell, Sirius. I loved you!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI loved you, and you left me with\n\n\nnothing\n\n\n, do you understand? I had nothing except a lot of scars and a drinking habit. So don\u2019t start interrogating me about the bits of my life I\u2019ve been able to put back together.\u201d\n\n\nRemus stood up and paced, the last of the full moon still hot in his veins. He stood by the window. He wanted to smoke, but he\u2019d learnt by now not to give in to those kinds of urges - the kind that felt good, but would probably kill you in the end. The kind of urges he got when Sirius was around.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Sirius\u2019s voice was still very small. He was hunched forward, his hair in his face. Pitiful.\n\n\nRemus felt terrible, even though he knew he deserved an apology. He hadn\u2019t meant to be hurtful.\n\n\nFor fuck\u2019s sake,\n\n\nRemus scolded himself,\n\n\nwhy can\u2019t we ever get this right?\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He said, steadying his voice, remembering to be understanding. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be so\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI understand. I swear, Moon--Remus, sorry - I swear, I thought about you every day. What you must think of me, what you must have heard\u2026 I was the stupid one, not you. I should have trusted you, I should have told you about Wormtail being made secret keeper - I mean, bloody hell, we should have made\n\n\nyou\n\n\nsecret keeper. Merlin, when I went to Godric\u2019s Hollow that night\u2026 I just\n\n\nlost it.\n\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI would have done the same.\u201d Remus sighed, \u201cI\u2019d have killed Wormtail. Sirius, I'm sorry too. I wish I hadn\u2019t believed them - I wish I\u2019d tried to investigate, done something to help you. I was just such a state, I barely went out, I was never sober. That stuff\u2019s all my fault. ...And that\u2019s why I needed Grant.\u201d\n\n\nSirius nodded, forlorn, still sitting at the table. It was too much, the air was too thick.\n\n\n\u201cHere, are you finished?\u201d Remus asked, needing a subject change, \u201cI\u2019ll do the washing up. Thanks for that, it was perfect.\u201d\n\n\nHe cleared up the plates and took them through to the kitchen. He folded up the last of Sirius\u2019s fried egg in a piece of toast and scoffed it - waste not want not. Sirius came in just as he was chewing,\n\n\n\u201cSame old Remus,\u201d he snorted, \u201cFinishing everyone\u2019s food.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Remus laughed, slightly abashed, turning on the taps. \u201cGrant used to call me the human refuse unit. Once he ordered a set meal for four from the takeaway downstairs, but got stuck on a work call, and by the time he came back I\u2019d eaten the lot.\u201d\n\n\nSirius took this anecdote pretty well. He came to stand beside Remus and took up a tea towel, so he could dry as Remus washed. They did this in companionable silence for a while, but Remus knew Sirius was building up to something. His body was giving off that agitated energy Remus recognised from long ago - were they going to have a fight again? He hoped not.\n\n\n\u201cHow long was he here?\u201d Sirius said, softly, \u201cHow long were you\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA long time.\u201d Remus replied, concentrating on the dishes.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that you had someone.\u201d Sirius said, with remarkable humility. \u201cI\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t alone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe was better than I deserved.\u201d Remus agreed, glancing at Sirius to check it was ok to continue. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d\u2026 I didn\u2019t think I could ever love someone who wasn\u2019t you. But I did. I loved him.\u201d\n\n\nSirius opened his mouth, but seemed to think better of it, and closed it again. He nodded, a shadow of disappointment crossing his face. He was trying\n\n\nso hard\n\n\n. Remus put down the last dish, carefully, and wiped his hands dry on his jeans.\n\n\nHe turned back to face Sirius, who was watching him like a hawk.\n\n\n\u201cI loved him.\u201d Remus said. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t you.\u201d\n\n\nSirius\u2019s eyes widened, hopefully. Remus gave him a small, shy smile, and a tiny shrug. Sirius leaned in, and all of a sudden they were inches apart, and then they were kissing, clutching each other tightly, as if it was their first and last.\n\n\nIt turned out you never really lost the knack. Like an unbroken spell, Remus felt every moment come flooding back to him as vividly as if it were yesterday; not the fights, or the war, or the emptiness, but the joy, the thrill of friendship, and the love - so, so much love; Remus felt as if he was being filled up with it; he was spilling over.\n\n\nJust as it had been the very first time, Remus\u2019s brain seemed to be yelling\n\n\nyes, yes yes\n\n\n! and he held onto Sirius with both hands,\n\n\nyou\u2019re mine, you\u2019re mine, you\u2019re mine.\n\n\n\nWhen they broke apart, they were both grinning, pressing their foreheads together, holding each other\u2019s shoulders as if they were fighting - or falling.\n\n\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Sirius whispered, \u201cI love you so much.\u201d He squeezed his eyes shut, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to say it back.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course I love you, you idiot,\u201d Remus gasped, not sure if he was laughing or crying, \u201cI never stopped.\u201d\n\n\nSirius laughed too, though his cheeks were wet, and kissed him again. And again, and again, and again.\n\n\nThey weren\u2019t teenagers anymore. They finished the washing up, and returned to the couch. Sirius suggested playing a record, instead of the TV, and Remus acquiesced, willing to give him anything he wanted. He selected Diamond Dogs, first, but Remus thought the lyrics to \u2018We are The Dead\u2019 might be too hard to hear. In the end it was Hunky Dory, which had happier tunes on it.\n\n\nSirius stretched out, his head in Remus\u2019s lap, and Remus stroked his hair and bent over to kiss him whenever he liked, because\n\n\nhe could, at last, he could\n\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cI missed you.\u201d He whispered.\n\n\nSirius squeezed his hand and turned his head, slightly, obviously not wanting Remus to see the emotion on his face. He cleared his throat, \u201cTell you what I\u2019ve missed,\u201d he said, a smile playing on his lips - that Sirius Black grin - \u201cSmoking. Haven\u2019t got a fag, have you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re bad for you.\u201d Remus tutted. \u201cThey kill you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all dying,\u201d Sirius replied.\n\n\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Remus agreed, lacing their fingers together, \u201cBut shouldn\u2019t life last longer, if it can be like this?\u201d\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThey fell asleep on the couch, probably because they were both too shy to suggest moving to the bedroom. Remus awoke to birdsong in the early hours of the morning, still upright, stiff, hips aching, the warm weight of Padfoot in his lap. He scratched sleepily behind the dog\u2019s ear, pushing him away to get up and use the loo.\n\n\nWhen he came back, Sirius was back to himself. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, \u201cI keep turning in my sleep. I think I spent too long as a dog in Azkaban.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Remus smiled, \u201cI don\u2019t mind at all.\u201d He stretched, \u201cWhat do we need to do today, is there anyone left on the list to talk to?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, we\u2019ve done everything,\u201d Sirius said. \u201cExcept find a new headquarters. Hey, I had a thought about that - what about that old church you stayed in with the werewolves?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2026 no, probably a bad idea. Greyback knows where it is.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still around, then.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm hmm. Tea?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\n\n\nRemus went into the kitchen and Sirius followed him, still talking, \u201cI just thought that would be good, because it\u2019s the middle of nowhere, so I can be there too. I hate the idea of you going off to meetings and me staying put.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you like it here?\u201d Remus raised an eyebrow. He loved his little flat, \u201cOther than Hogwarts, it\u2019s the only place I\u2019ve ever really felt at home.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh Remus.\u201d Sirius squeezed his arm, \u201cYou\u2019ve gone all soft in your old age.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPiss off.\u201d Remus snorted, giving him a light nudge with his elbow. \u201cWe didn\u2019t all grow up in mansions.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo but-- hey! Hey, Remus, that\u2019s it!\u201d Sirius was shaking his shoulder now, jogging Remus as he tried to pour the milk.\n\n\n\u201cOi, watch it! What?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy mansion! Or it\u2019s mine now, anyway - my parents are both dead, I\u2019m the Black heir! The house will answer to me!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I see,\u201d Remus frowned, turning to look at Sirius properly, \u201cAre you sure? I mean\u2026 you really want to go back there?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, no, obviously I don\u2019t. But it\u2019s probably one of the most protected houses in Britain - the Blacks took home security really bloody seriously. There are enough rooms for all the Weasleys and then some - oh merlin, imagine my bitch mother\u2019s face if she knew I\u2019d invited the Weasleys over to stay! It\u2019s something I can do to help, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut Sirius, think about it, you\u2019ll be in the home your parents lived in - all their things will be there\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll chuck it all out,\u201d Sirius waved a hand, \u201cAnd it\u2019s so safe - a safe place for Harry, Remus.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt does sound\u2026\u201d Remus thought hard, coming around to the idea. \u201cIf you\u2019re\n\n\nsure\n\n\n?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course I am! And anyway, it won\u2019t be half as grim if I have you there with me, will it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHa,\u201d Remus poked him, \u201cNow who\u2019s gone soft?\u201d\n\n\nThey got in touch with Dumbledore via the fireplace, and even he sounded impressed with this idea. He wanted to know how to get in, what sort of charms and curses Sirius knew about, how soon he could alert the Order.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need to give the place a proper clean,\u201d Sirius said, eagerly, \u201cIt\u2019ll be full of junk, but I can help, if I\u2019m going to be there all the time, and no one is better with magical pests than Remus!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAn excellent idea, gentlemen,\u201d Dumbledore\u2019s eyes twinkled through the flames, \u201cAnd right under Voldemort\u2019s nose - in the home of his most loyal supporters! How soon can you both get there?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTomorrow.\u201d Remus said, quickly, because he knew Sirius had been about to say \u2018right now!\u2019 \u201cWe\u2019ll go after dark, so it\u2019s less suspicious.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood man, Lupin,\u201d Dumbledore said, \u201cIn that case I shall await word from you.\u201d\n\n\nHis face vanished in a puff of smoke.\n\n\n\u201cYes, Moony! Sorry, Remus\u2026\u201d Sirius cheered. \u201cAmazing! Let's pack!\u201d\n\n\nOf course, Sirius had barely anything\n\n\nto\n\n\npack, and was much too excited to be sensible anyway. That was left up to Remus, who began making a list of all the things they would need - books of course, all the notes from the first war. Clothes, food, bedsheets - Remus didn\u2019t know how long Grimmauld Place had stood empty, he wasn't sure if any of it would be salvageable.\n\n\n\u201cI can finally show you my bedroom!\u201d Sirius trilled, \u201cOoh, teenage me would be so jealous, getting Remus Lupin in my bedroom!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHa,\u201d Remus snorted, folding up robes and stuffing them into his trunk.\n\n\n\u201cAnd just wait until Harry arrives! We can sort out a room for him, and when the war's over, it'll be his\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRemus smiled and kissed him and agreed it would all be lovely, it would be an adventure, because that was what Sirius needed from him just then. And he was determined to do everything Sirius needed for as long as he could.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see Andromeda - and her kid! Must be in seventh year now, surely? Hey, imagine if she and Harry fall in love, how completely mental would that be? Then he'd be\u2026 what, my second cousin?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOnce removed, or something like that,\u201d Remus acknowledged, \u201cWhat are you talking about, anyway, they're almost a decade apart. We were thirteen when Andromeda had that kid.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd Moody, the old codger, and Arthur, and Gideon and\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSirius, no,\u201d Remus said, gently, \u201cRemember, Gid and Fab died.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 oh yeah\u2026\u201d Sirius's face fell, and Remus felt dreadful. Perhaps he couldn't just go along with everything. He touched Sirius's hand, \u201cIt's ok, you're already remembering things much better than a few weeks ago.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Sirius said, uncertain. He rubbed his arm. \u201cI think I'll go and have a rest, if that's ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\nRemus finished all of the packing, and when he went back to the living room, Padfoot was curled up on the couch again.\n\n\nThey ate a light meal for dinner, and Remus had the TV on because it was his last night around all of his muggle comforts. They still decided to take all of their old records - though plenty had warped over time, and gave off an unpleasant hissing sound over the music. With everything packed away in trunks and boxes, it felt very final, to Remus. But perhaps that was just nerves.\n\n\nHe tried to stay calm, watching the sky outside turn a deeper shade of blue, the streetlights turning from pale pink to thick amber, and the stars beginning to show. Light pollution in London meant that stars were rare - you could only make out the very brightest ones.\n\n\nSirius's head was nodding against his shoulder already, as the tv announced the nine o'clock news. Remus yawned and flicked his wand at the screen, turning it off for the last time. \u201cOi,\u201d he whispered to Sirius, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go to bed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMmph.\u201d\n\n\nRemus had to shake him a bit, but finally Sirius staggered up and wandered zombie-like down the hall. Remus brushed his teeth and washed his face, then followed him in.\n\n\nSirius was standing beside the bed, biting his lip.\n\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Remus yawned, climbing under the covers, \u201cWhat's wrong?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUm. Nothing.\u201d Sirius got in, slowly.\n\n\nRemus pulled him close, so happy to have him near again. He wrapped his arms around Sirius's body and inhaled the scent of him, and buried his face in that beautiful hair. He felt so good. He felt complete. He kissed Sirius\u2019s cheek, searching for his mouth, \u201cLove you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLove you too.\u201d Sirius returned, though he was very tense, and turned his head away.\n\n\n\u201cWhat's wrong?\u201d Remus asked, pulling away, \u201cAm I being too\u2026?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I just\u2026\u201d Sirius pulled back too. \u201cSorry, I just don't think I can\u2026 you know, any more.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Remus blinked, \u201cOh, Jesus, sorry, I didn't mean to\u2026 of course not, if you don't want to.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I want to,\u201d Sirius squirmed, \u201cI'm just not sure I can. Since Azkaban\u2026 um. There's not really been a lot \u2018going on\u2019, if you know what I mean. I might not\u2026 er. I just don't want you to think it's\n\n\nyou.\n\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nOh!\u201d\n\n\nRemus blinked again. He didn't really know what to say, or what to do. This was not a problem he'd ever encountered before. He wanted to be kind. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you're here,\u201d he said, truthfully. \u201cI don't need anything else.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\n\nReally.\n\n\n\u201d\n\n\nSirius turned around, and took Remus's face in his hands, and kissed him, long and deep. That would have been enough; truly, honestly. Remus would have been happy with Sirius's lips, Sirius's taste and scent. But after a while, Sirius pulled back, and grinned,\n\n\n\u201cDoesn't mean I don't want you to try\u2026\u201d\n\n\nAnd Remus just about dissolved.\n\n\nIt took a very long time. There had to be a lot more kissing, a lot more coaxing and gentle caresses and heated whispers; it took hours and hours. But how could Remus complain, when he finally had Sirius sighing in his arms again? It was so tender and so, so beautiful.\n\n\nAfterwards they lay exhausted, and hot, and happy. Remus felt as if every hair on his body was singing; every nerve ending humming. Sirius curled into his body, and stroked his scars, like he used to.\n\n\n\u201cHmmm.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHmmm.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemus?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan I ask you one question?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Remus smiled, \u201cIf you really must.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat have you been doing all these years, Moon--sorry.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s ok. Call me Moony.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMoony.\u201d he sighed, happily, \u201cWhat have you been doing? When we called around everybody - they were as surprised to see you as me. They all said they hadn\u2019t seen you for a long time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSince the war.\u201d Remus confirmed. \u201cSince Lily and James.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Sirius asked, frowning.\n\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t bear it.\u201d Remus said, simply. \u201cBeing around anyone who knew what had happened. I\u2019ve seen Mary once or twice, but no one else. I wanted to be alone.\u201d\n\n\nSirius shook his head, looking frustrated. \u201cI don\u2019t understand you, Moony.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Remus smiled softly, \u201cNo, you never did, quite.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d Sirius accepted.\n\n\nHe lay back onto Remus, with his whole weight - though that wasn\u2019t much. It was pathetic, really. Two bony, wiry men, clinging together; both old before their time, and both so lost.\n\n\nThey had never understood each other, not really.\n\n\n\u201cYou always tried, though.\u201d Remus said, into Sirius\u2019s hair. He wrapped an arm around him and kissed his head. \u201cYou still knew more than anyone else ever has. Ever will.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEven though I thought you were--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to talk about that.\u201d\n\n\nSirius gave half a sigh, and Remus knew he disapproved, but they\u2019d done enough talking, for now. They were quiet for a long time, and Remus closed his eyes.\n\n\nFinally, Sirius spoke.\n\n\n\u201cEven if we don\u2019t talk about it, don\u2019t you think we ought to try to forgive each other?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou sound like Dumbledore.\u201d Remus snorted.\n\n\n\u201cHa.\u201d Sirius said. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. Can you believe we\u2019re back following orders from that old fool? I s\u2019pose I don\u2019t really know much about forgiveness.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMe neither.\u201d Remus sighed.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth anything, really, with lives as short as ours.\u201d Sirius said, sadly, \u00a0\u201cI think at this point, there\u2019s only love and hate.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very fatalistic of you.\u201d Remus commented, \u201cI thought\n\n\nI\n\n\nwas supposed to be the pessimist.\u201d\n\n\nSirius shuddered slightly, which Remus took for a laugh. He squeezed him tighter, and kissed his shoulder. \u201cLove and hate.\u201d He murmured, thoughtfully.\n\n\n\u201cLove\n\n\nor\n\n\nhate, I s\u2019pose.\u201d Sirius clarified. \u201cYou make a choice.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that simple, then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah. I think it is.\u201d Sirius reached for his hand under the duvet. He looked up at Remus, eyes now icy grey, but as piercing as ever. He was asking a question.\n\n\nRemus squeezed his hand in answer,\n\n\n\u201cLove.\u201d He said.\n\n\nAnd then he kissed him.\n\n\n\nThe End."
