### Audiobookify

Small project to read populor fanfiction novels and convert them to audiobooks with charectar specific voices.

Reqs:

- The voices should emulate the charecters personalities

How:
- Scrape books from webnovel.com
- Create a transcript e.g.
  - Narrator: Bellowing winds further enrage the fires englushing much of californian subarbia
  - Bruce: Oh man, it's a fire
  - Narrator: Bruce said in his husky smokers voice
- Create a description for each charectar
- Create a custom voice for each charectar based on the description
- Chain transcript audios together for a full audiobook
